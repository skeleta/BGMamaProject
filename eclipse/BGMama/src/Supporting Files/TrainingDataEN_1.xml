<comment category="positive" id="UR124359517">We stayed at the Best Western Plus Pioneer Square Hotel for 2 nights in mid-Sept, 2011. If you are looking for a conveniently-located downtown hotel for a reasonable price, this hotel is for you. It is located within a couple blocks of the Bus tunnel which gets you downtown for free during the day and also provides a way to get to the airport. However, it is close enough to walk to the waterfront attractions, Pike Place Market, the ballpark, the stadium, and the center-city of Seattle. We did not get a rental car because of the location and availability of public transportation. The hotel is in a historic building. The rooms are quite nice and are not "cookie-cutter". There are not many amenities to the hotel itself, though there is a breakfast room and "free" Continental breakfast was included in our room rate. There is a pub next door (same building) as well as several other shops. A good Italian restaurant (Al Boccalino) is less than 100 feet away, and a variety of shops and restaurants or pubs are very close. The "Seattle Underground" tour is located nearby and a couple of ferries are within sight out the front door of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They greeted us as we walked by the front desk every time. We would like to get back to Seattle next year to see more sights and catch a ballgame. This hotel will be our first choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124231798">Stayed two nights after AMTRAKing from LA. Walked from railway station to hotel. An old building refitted to be good lodging place. Refitting was installing bathroom in each room as an afterthought. Remaining space is small for higher class hotel. Simularly, the elevator column eats part of the original lobby space. The classy open stairway is still in service. Also, historic district sign code constricts the outdoor sign of the hotel to omit the words Best Western. beyond her oddities the place was just fine. Good beds, clean bathrooms, nice breakfast, WIFI, internet computers, competent staff, reasonable price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122179928">If I hadn't paid full price I would have thought I was in a hostel. It was terrible starting with fighting traffic until a space was open in front of the hotel to park to check in. The parking garage was a nightmare with small twisting levels and cars traveling in both directions down the ramp. The room was very small and didn't have a desk or a place to work other than the bed. Very uncomfortable to use a laptop. Breakfast was very bare bones with mediocre coffee and reconstituted juice. All night the people above me were moving around and making enough noise to wake me. The staff was wonderful and the room was very clean. The hotel staff were wonderful and very helpful but I would never stay here again, it was a hassle from the beginning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121926784">Having stayed at many BW hotels this was a nice, refreshing surprise. The booking (on the road) and the check in upon arrival was excellent and the service outstanding. Having a large 3/4 ton van can have its challenges for parking, however the reception staff were very helpful in accomodating this requirement, even before I got there. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and decor. The location is great if you want to explore downtown Seattle and its historic section. Pikes market is a nice walk away and the 'free' tourist bus route is close at hand. The rail transit to/from Seatac is not too far away and is an economical way to travel this leg, if required.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121769680">I have stayed at many Best Westerns across 4 continents and have learned never to have very high hopes, but this one was a nice surprise. The check in was quick, with friendly polite service, and the room was very big with a very comfortable king size bed, and it looked immaculate. The bathroom is quite small however, and only has a shower, which is fine by me, although the shower can double as a shallow, small tub but for people who want a full size tub this would be a problem. As I said, the shower was fine for me, with brand name soaps etc., and nice big fluffy towels that also looked new. My only negative comment would be that I would have liked a choice of feather pillows, instead of synthetic, but maybe that's asking too much. I found the price to be excellent as well for a downtown hotel, and would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. A very pleasant stay, at a very pleasant hotel. Recommended.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR121442023">Some friends and I booked this hotel for my Birthday becasue it was close to the bars in pioneer square. I booked the "deluxe city view room" ...it was neither deluxe nor city view. It was the smallest hotel room i have ever been in, and our "city view" was of a parking lot. As for the parking, it was 2 blocks away in a public parking garage, were the posted public price per day was $6 less that what i payed at the front desk.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121212371">One of the hotel highlights of our west coast trip. We chose this hotel because of it's location close to the Amtrak station and the positive reviews from trip Advisor. We stayed for 2 days in late October and loved the ambiance of the architecture and cozy comfort, and quiet of our spotlessly clean room. We had no view, but who cares, we were more interested in viewing Seattle by walking and Pioneer Square is perfect for it! This was also one of the most pleasant, and helpful front desk staffs we have ever dealt with. The breakfast was very good and they get extra stars for serving so early.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121068100">Don't judge a book by its cover. When I drove up to this hotel at night, I had second thoughts about making that reservation. It looked like a seedy hotel in a forgotten part of town. But step inside, and you'll find a quaint, well-decorated space with a friendly, attentive staff. Our room was clean and bright with large windows and high ceilings. The location is south of the busy downtown, but there are plenty of great eateries and interesting shops. It's just a couple of blocks from the waterfront. Pike Place Market is further away, but we walked there--the blocks are short. We parked our car in an off-site parking garage nearby and walked everywhere. It rained non-stop, but the hotel loaned us umbrellas. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. This will be my Seattle hotel from now on.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119772887">I liked this hotel. The staff greeted us and were very helpful in finding a room suitable for my mobility needs (close to lift, big shower). We were upgraded to a room with a huge king size bed, lots of room and a large square tub, not too high, that had a seat built into it. Nice. :9) This place is clean and recently redone. The staircase is something they are proud of and the panelled conference room with 24/7 use of two pc's. I brought over some pho from a restaurant across the street and the young fellow at reception was pleased to bring me a large bowl from the hotel to eat my pho. Nice touch, fellow. Our room was on the inside of the hotel on the airshaft, but we heard almost nothing of the other guests.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119762683">I've stayed in this quaint Victorian style hotel with my wife on an overnight trip to Seattle. Staff was very friendly and accommodating from the get-go. The hotel is situated just minutes from the piers, and in walking distance to the downtown core. No need to take a taxi, everything is really close. The room, although facing the water and a busy street, was quiet and clean! The bed was very comfortable and he bathroom had a great size.The breakfast was very good and open early, a good start to the day with lots of different choices. If there's one negative at all, it's the availability of parking, the hotel doesn't seem to have a parking lot, the public parking is available but very expensive (we paid $36) for one night. (although there might have been a surcharge because the Sounders had a game that night). Being located so close to the stadiums and downtown, this hotel will be my choice from now on for every trip to Seattle in the future! To all staff: Thank you very much for making us feel welcome! We'll be back!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119438901">We stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for two nights at the end of our Seattle trip (we stayed with friends for the first half). It was great! The room was big enough for the two of us, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious, as well as restocked each day. I liked the old charm of this historic building. The free breakfast was basic, but was plenty for us (cereal, fruit, and waffles, if you wanted). Since we did the Underground Tour on our first day in Seattle, we were acquainted with the Pioneer Square area, and getting around was not a problem. During our stay at the Best Western, we walked to Columbia Tower, Seattle Aquarium, and Pike Place. We managed to take the bus to the Space Needle without issue as well - the bus stop is a block away. We took a taxi back from the Space Needle ($8-9 with tip), and noticed the fare to SeaTac was $32. Instead, we took the light rail from the Pioneer Square Station to SeaTac, which is three blocks (albeit uphill) from the hotel for a cheeeeeeeap $2.75. Just be sure to allow 40 minutes or so for the ride if you choose the light rail. Also, if you're looking for a great sandwich, my husband and I highly recommend Delicatus, which is a block up from the hotel on 1st Ave. I am still fantasizing about their Pav Diablo sandwich, yum. If you sleep late or want a second breakfast, Planet Java is one block over from the hotel on South Washington - we had a decent brunch there, eggs, turkey sausage and waffles. Nothing extraordinary, but tasty and filling. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, pleasant staff, very clean, great location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119331634">On a road trip from San Diego to Seattle, we found the best hotel last! Stayed here for two nights and would recommend it to anyone. The hotel itself is lovely and historic but updated in all the right places. The location can't be beat. It is a block from the piers for dinner and ferry rides and at the edge of the historic district for walking around old Seattle. The staff is very pleasant and uber helpful. Beds were comfy. We had a king at the front of the hotel overlooking Yesler. The room was small but the location and the price more than made up for it. Walked everywhere from here and found a few pubs serving local brews. Definitely worth it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118396152">We stayed for 2 nights at the Great Western Pioneer Square Hotel. We enjoyed our stay and found the hotel very comfortable, convenient and the staff extremely helpful. I was originally worried about noise being downtown, however, room 419 on the front of the hotel, was an excellent choice and was quiet, extremely clean, well serviced and very comfortable. The continental breakfast included with the rate was good - cereals, boiled eggs, pastries, toast, jams, good coffee, juice and you could make a fresh waffle too - more than enough to get you going for a day. The underground tour runs from Pioneer Square a block away. It is a very interesting tour, lots of humour, worth doing. We liked being in the historic part of town - walked down First Avenue to Pike Market and the main town shopping centre. The train/light rail is only a few blocks walk from the hotel though, and you can catch this to the city or a suburban mall if you have time. We walked to the station with our luggage and caught the light rail to Seatac airport and at $2.75 a person this was a great value deal in saving on cab fare. The hotel overall and the great helpful staff exceeded our expectations.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118292052">Very friendly and helpful staff, good complimentary breakfast. Rooms were decent-sized and comfortable. It looked like it was remodeled within the last 5 years. It is only 1.5 blocks from the Metro station, so it was convenient getting from and to Sea-Tac airport. It is located in the historic section of Seattle. The only negatives are that about 3 blocks away are the shelters and missions for the homeless. The walls of the hotel are a little thin; we didn't hear people talking, but did hear the plumbing whenever a nearby toilet was flushed or shower turned on. The hotel is about a block away from an elevated highway, so it was a little noisy during the weekday mornings. Otherwise, the hotel was a great place to stay and a pretty good value. Within walking distance to Pike's Market, Seattle Center (less than 2 mi), and Chinatown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118249428">We booked the 4 night package prior to joining a cruise, we had stayed in Seattle before in a hotel with a room that was no bigger than a shoe box. This was not the case with this hotel, the room was large, light and airy and the bathroom had a very unusual shower that also doubled as a bath. The first impression of the hotel was not that good, there is a lot of dark wood panelling in reception and the lighting is a bit gloomy, however check in was both speedy and friendly, with the welcome news that the hotel had free wifi. The breakfast which is included in the room rate is good, always great to make your own waffles. The down side of the breakfast room is that it can be a bit cramped when busy and I'm afraid some guests have been quite careless and spilled things on the floor and stained the carpet - it really could do with a good shampoo just to tidy it up. The hotel is in a perfect location, near to the water front, so handy for ferries. For a bargain rate of just $2.75 you can take the light railway from the airport and the walk the block and a half to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again, also plenty of good eating places in walking distance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117518809">After reading this hotel's website as well as many of the online reviews, I found myself unable to find much information about its complementary breakfast. Would it be a stale bagel and a cup of coffee ....... or a more complete breakfast with biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, etc........... or what? My husband and I stayed here for one night before a trip on Amtrak, and for those of you who would like to know what you'll get for breakfast, here's what we found: waffles with whipped cream, strawberries, and syrup, Kelloggs boxed cereals, bananas, apples, oranges, packaged fruit cups, yogurt, orange juice, apple juice, bread/toast/bagels/sweet rolls/ muffins, hard boiled eggs, coffee, Bigelow teas, and milk. Our room was not large, but was clean and well appointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were very satisfied with our stay, and would not hesitate to stay here again if we wanted to be in this vicinity. We certainly felt that the breakfast was adequate for most folks.<topic>none</topic>

Breakfast was good, service/staff was friendly. Parking rather inconvenient as you had to drive a couple of blocks away to park and then the ticket wouldn't work and we had to haggle with the parking lot attendant. Overall ok, but I won't be back.

<comment category="positive" id="UR116723969">We flew into Seattle to spend the night before our planned vacation to Victoria, Vancouver Island and San Francisco. This hotel is so convenient and the staff is very welcoming. From SEA/TAC airport we took light rail to Pioneer Square which arrived 1-1/2 blocks from the hotel. We literally walked down the street from the exit, turned right on Yessler Way and the hotel was about 3/4 a block down on the left. Our room was spacious, very, very clean and the breakfast the next morning was Continental along with waffles. We walked to the Space Needle for dinner and rode public transportation back - really easy. The next morning, the Victoria Clipper, Pier 65, to Victoria was just 1 mile from the hotel. On returning to Seattle from Victoria, we stayed a 2nd time at the Best Western (great, clean accommodations again) and took Amtrak the next morning (0.3 miles from the hotel) to San Francisco. We would definitely go back to the Best Western on a return trip to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

The staff at Best Western Pioneer Square came to our rescue. Kai showed us a room that fit us perfectly. We were able to walk-in to a room that was far better than the "luxurious" hotel that thwarted us just the night before. Not only did we secure a charming room, warm smiles and a caring staff, but they also gave us dinner reccomendations that was far better than the nearest pizza hut. Best Western- thank you.

We were a group with four generations (Grandmother, my Inlaws, Dh/myself and our 1yr old DD). We took a shuttle from the airport but could have easily taken the light rail for $2.75 had we not had our 84 yo grandmother. The hotel was perfectly located to walk to lots of restaurants, bars, the Underground tour, Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle if you are adventurous, an easy 4 minute walk to the light rail, and best of all it's right on the water and easy to walk all the great seafood restaurants and the Pier. Every room was a little different, we had four and they were all shaped different with different coffee pots (in-laws had a Keurig, Grandmother had a balcony) and the morning breakfast was really nice, fresh waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, water, coffee and juice.

<comment category="negative" id="UR115845645">This Best Western is located on the waterfront, close to the piers and within walking distance to the Baseball stadium/chinatown and of course-Pioneer Square. Because it is on the courtesy bus route(during the day), you can avoid the hills to get to the Fish Market and other places within the city. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was nice. We enjoyed discovering another part of town after staying near the Space Needle before our cruise. The location of the Best Western hotel had some more grungy type bars, but we found some nicer restaurants. I couldn't imagine a couple over 60 or a familyenjoying its local very much.(Nearer the Spcae Needle seems better), but we found the area interesting and I enjoyed the underground tour which was minutes from the hotel, Most important-if you are able bodied-there is a metro for $2.00 to the airport with a stop 5 minutes walk away from the hotel(slighly uphill) that will save you a $50 limo ride!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR113868520">I stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for 3 days (4 nights). I found the hotel to be a very good combination of location, amenities and price. I arrived at the Sea-Tac airport and walked to the light rail station that is adjacent to the huge parking garage by Terminal D. After a 30 minute ride, I got off at the Pioneer Square station and walked the remaining 3 blocks to the hotel. Very cool. My single room was ready at 3pm as promised. Located on the 4th (top) floor, I discovered the room faced the adjacent double decked expressway that goes along the waterfront. However the double paned windows did an excellent job of keeping out the noise from the traffic. The room was good sized and more that sufficient for just me. The daily service to replenish the towels and make the bed was excellent and not obtrusive. The breakfast - included in the room cost - was extensive including just about everything except eggs and bacon. When I checked out, I simply walked to the light rail station (I got there at 6:45am - with no problems) and within 1.25 hours of walking out of the hotel, I was sitting in the departure lounge for my flight home. Again - the light rail worked like a charm. I found the location to be terrific. Pioneer Square is interesting and has a bunch of history. Or I walked down 1st street - past the Seattle Art Museum (OK but not great) - on to the Pike Street Market (about 15 minutes walk - and absolutely terrific) and all the great restaurants nearby. Alternatively I could walk 1 block to Alaskan Way - the street that borders the waterfront, - and sight see down the waterfront at all the seafood restaurants, cruise excursions and Seattle Aquarium (terrific) located on that street. As for the Pioneer Square neighborhood - I never felt uncomfortable during the day or night as I was wandering around. I paid for my stay in advance without the possibility of any refund. A gamble that worked out for me and got me an average daily room price of about $140. Free wi-fi is available and worked great. Bottom line: a very attractive combination of good hotel, great location, at a terrific price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112804165">The hotel is a nice historical hotel in Pioneer Square neighborhood of Seattle. Room size was large and bed was comfortable. Continental breakfast had plenty of options and I loved the waffles. One minor qualm was the free wireless internet access available from the room was limited by number of connections, and 50% of the time I received "Number of connections already reached. Try again later." Since I was on vacation and need to spend less time online anyway, this was not a big deal to me. If you NEED internet, keep this in mind. Staff was friendly. I had read comments elsewhere about Pioneer Square being where the hoodlums hang out. Between the hotel and the downtown attractions, I did not notice this. Head toward the stadiums down Occidental and you may encounter several. Hotel was great for our vacation stay and the price was half of what I would have paid elsewhere downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112730613">I forgot to add in our last review,and feel very important,that we took the light rail system from Sea-Tac airport for $2.50 a person within a couple easy walking blocks of the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. The light rail system was very clean and a pleasant 30 minute ride for $2.50! Took towncar from hotel to cruise terminal for $20. All worked great.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112490573">If you appreciate history, wonderful architecture and exceptional service, this is the place to stay in Seattle. You are located in the free bus zone with a stop right outside the door. This bus will take you around all the greatest sites in the Pioneer Square area - including "the market". You will find yourself within walking distance of wonderful restaurants as well as activities like the Underground Tour. The Hotel has retained all of the good things from the past (10 foot ceilings and room layouts) and has upgraded where you want it to be ie the bathroom is totally modern as are the beds etc. The breakfast offered in the morning is very good also.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR110381164">My son and I spent 3 nights here to see the sights and take in some Mariner's games. We found the Pioneer Square area ideal, with a definite historical feel. It was an easy walk to the ballpark and the Seattle Center. The Air Museum and Underground Tour were both worth seeing. We used a city bus to get to the Air Museum and found the bus drivers very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with all our questions. The free continental breakfast was much more than the usual rolls and cereal including a great staff to keep things replenished and clean. I highly recommend staying here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR107742340">This is a historical building located perfectly in Pioneer Square. The rooms are indeed small, however they are furnished accordingly and they exude lots of charm. Our room was spiffy and clean. The TV is dated, however we didn't come here to watch television, so it was OK. We parkeed our full size pickup in the parkinf garage 2 blocks away, and this may sound inconvienent, it was not. The cost was 20 bucks a day, with in and out privelidges. We really liked the location, close to Pikes and the waterfront, and of course all the history of the area in general. The Under ground tour was close by, as was the public transportation system to get to the Monorail and Space Needle. The staff here is more than friendly, everyone was anxious to help and give advice, we would stay here again without a doubt.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR105618345">My father and I stayed at this place during a weekend trip to Seattle. Both of rooms were well appointed and comfortable and service is very friendly. The rooms are very old-school, but it does add to the charm of the place. They serve a very good continental breakfast in the morning wit waffles, fruit, pastries, cereal, and bage. Location is excellent with the LINK train to the airport only a couple of blocks away and downtown within easy walking distance. One small service issue that I had, on 2 of the three mornings, I requested wake-up calls. I did not get the call the first morning and it was 1/2 late the second morning. I was in Seattle on leisure, and only had the calls so that I would not sleep the day away. Ultimately, not a big deal, but under different circumstances, it could have been a big issue. All in all, an enjoyable stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR105520997">I stayed in the Pioneer Square Hotel for 5 nights last week. When i arrived, i was warmly greeted by "Randy" who could not do enough to welcome me. He was so pleasant, it was a great first impression. I stayed on the 2nd Floor towards the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious and had all the amenities you would expect from a really good hotel, flat screen tv, iron, free wi-fi, coffee maker, desk and a very comfortable king bed. Maid service was good, and although i can be messy, the room was as good as new every time i came back after a day out around Seattle. The free continental breakfast was great also, and filled me up for the rest of the day. Particularly, the waffle making machine meant i could have a tasty hot waffle and maple syrup every morning, FAB. Location wise, you cannot get much better. It is close to funky jazz clubs, bars and restaurants. It is also really close to the waterfront and harbour cruises. There is also a bar next door and an Italian restaurant on the corner. It is also close to the baseball and football fields. I went to see the Seattle Mariners and had a great night with only a short walk back. Great hotel for the price. So glad i booked this hotel instead of splashing out double the price on something which could not deliver any more. Great place to see Seattle from.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR103380525">I had to stay in Seattle for a length of time. My father had been murdered and we had to go to trial. I stayed at this hotel for at least a total of 8 weeks between Nov 2010 through March of 2011. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and it's staff! Some of the rooms are a little small but this is a historical building. They do have larger rooms and they are great. I just wish they had a hot tub so I could relax after a long day at court! I loved the fact that each day I got a hello when I came in and a good luck when I left! They always made me feel like family! I must admit I love the fact that I get a knock on my door to find out if I need extra towels at the end of the day. Nice touch! The staff was always willing to help me! Never did I ever get anything but OUTSTANDING customer service. I am the owner of a small business and if I had staff like this my business would go crazy! I know all of the names of the front desk and each of them deserves a raise/bounes for all of the care and attention I and my family was given. A giant thank you to all of the staff form the front desk to the housekeeping! When we got the guilty verdict for the person that killed my father I could not wait to go back to the hotel and let them all know. It was like going home!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102448656">I was on a "leisure trip" while my husband was on business. We specifically picked this property due to its proximity to Route 99--to get me where I wanted to go and to get him to his conference at Pier 66--and the perceived charm of the old Seattle area. But I won't say that it was a quick decision. Someone had posted a concern on this site about the homeless and noise of the area, which caused us to think long and hard before keeping this reservation out of safety concerns. We are both glad we stuck with it in the end and I'll explain more here if you wish to read it. First of all, we were right about the ease of getting around. Walking through Pioneer Square was a lot of fun. We found a great antiques shop, a diner with wonderfully fresh battered cod, and took the Underground Walking Tour. We used the Route 99 bus (temporary replacement for the Waterfront Trolley) repeatedly--to go shopping, to head to Chinatown, to go to the fish market, and to the waterfront. It stops right in right of the hotel for one direction, and within a short block walk for the other. Second, the customer service of this property was phenomenal. They were friendly and helpful in every way possible. If nothing else, that makes this property quite unique. Add that to the charm of the building and this was the nicest Best Western I've stayed in. Now, as to the homeless. Sad that there are people who have to live like that, and Seattle does seem to have their fair share. But contrary to what I had read, they are not dangerous, nor do they harass you on every corner. I think I saw maybe 3 or 4 actually begging to money in some way; the rest are just trying to get through life as pleasantly as possible. As to safety: While the latest we were out walking in the area was around 8:30 pm, I did not feel unsafe. I even ended up walking past the men's homeless shelter by myself one evening around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised to find that not a soul bothered me or even tried to approach me. As to the "noise", supposedly there is the traffic from the freeway on one side and bars on another. We requested a quiet room and was provided one on the interior of the hotel, so we heard none of that, if in fact it is as bad as someone writes. One more bonus--this hotel is less than 3 blocks from the entrance to the light rail/underground tunnel bus access. Straight to Macy's to shop on any bus in the free zone; and straight to SeaTac airport for only $2.50 per person on light rail.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102162989">Location was great. Close to the light rail (taken from the airport). Many good ethnic restaurants in immediate area. Turning left from the front door, you are about 200 yards from the dock of one of the ferries. I asked for a quiet room, and my interior room was extremely quiet. Breakfast was well above-average, good coffee, hard boiled eggs, cereal, etc. Thank you. Oh, the feel of Yesler Way neighborhood did not bother me. It originally was the "skid row" (logging) and is quite worn. Yes, you will see some street people, but I just smile and walk on by.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR101971000">I was looking for a relatively central, clean place to stay in Seattle with my 8-year-old son as a base for forays to the Woodland Park Zoo and the Boeing Field museum. This hotel fit the bill perfectly, and at $88 per night through dhr.com the price was fantastic compared to other options. The building is older, but has been splendidly updated and we wanted for nothing. Breakfast was perfectly acceptable and included; only gourmet snobs and greedy gluttons could complain! Parking is limited and the garage is a block away, but the system works very well. If there are no more parking spots left, there is an open lot across the street at $13 overnight. Pioneer Square is ever so slightly rough around the edges, but we felt perfectly safe. This is now my go-to hotel for Seattle visits!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98844995">I had a large, clean room located in the middle of the hotel. It overlooked a tiny courtyard so there was no view but at least there was no street noise whatsoever. The bed was comfortable and it was great to have free local calls and free internet (not wireless). The free continental breakfast was very nice and the front desk staff were very professional. I opted to stay here because of the above and their no pets and no smoking policies. The only negative point I have is that the only heat source in the room was a very noisy window mounted fan. I had to turn it off during the night as there is no way I would have been able to sleep with it on. Do not be put off staying here because of the location. I felt safer in Pioneer Square than parts of downtown (2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th Ave street corners for example). I would not have a problem staying here again but think I'll opt for somewhere a bit more modern.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98149970">The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. The room was clean, decorated in a style fitting with historic restoration but not too fussy. Location was fabulous for us - it was sunny the 2 days we were in Seattle and we walked everywhere we needed to go: Pike's Place Market, ferry to Bainbridge Island, wonderful food just around the corner. We could have taken the bus in the downtown "free zone" to any of those places had it been raining. The light rail station was less than 2 blocks - so fare to the city from SeaTac was $2.50 per person each way. First night there was someone talking in the hall (near our room) as soon as we called the front desk someone came and asked him to move - which he did. Weather was cold and halls were kept cool, but our room was toasty warm. We're looking forward to staying there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR97977252">Stayed here based on TripAdvisor comments, which were mostly right-on. The most significant for us were: 1) Location within walking distance of the Amtrak King St. Station, Pioneer Square, and the free bus line (#99) which accesses everything from Belltown to Chinatown. Ferry terminal and stadiums are also nearby. 2) A room that was large, quiet, and very clean. We asked for and were given a quiet, interior room. Many exterior rooms face the Highway 99 Viaduct or the street, so they are probably a bit noisy. 3) Staff that was helpful and friendly, with no exceptions. 4) A fair price. In summary: A great place to enjoy the city without a car.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR94272704">The Best Western Pioneer Square is a rather old building that shows some signs of its age on the exterior, and it has a couple of rather gloomy-looking alleyways beside it, but don't let any of that put you off. The inside has been 100% rennovated, and is more than adequate for a hotel stay. The room rates are much lower than some of the larger hotels just a few blocks away, and the furnishings and staff were quite good. The room had fixtures that looked brand new, and the bathroom and furniture were very clean and comfortable. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful with every request. The hotel may not have had a large number of guests during the time of my stay, but whether that was the reason or not, it was one of the quietest rooms ever experienced in a hotel. Made for a very good night's sleep.I would have no hesitation about staying there again, and the lower price is just an added incentive.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR93896196">This was our first trip to Seattle and we were amazed at how nice and attentive the staff was at this hotel. Everyone was very friendly. We arrived early, so our room was not ready, but the staff checked us in and stored our bags for us. They gave us maps of Seattle and showed us how to get to Pike Place. They invited us to have some complementary breakfast too. Its a quick walk to Pike Place Market from the Hotel. After walking around, we headed back to the hotel with our room ready and were very happy with the size and cleanliness of the room. Our flight was very early morning and the staff on duty even made the effort to get us some breakfast even though they were not open yet. They also arranged our transportation to the Airport.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR93268383">We booked on their website, the least expensive room with two twin beds, but this may not exist, because we were upgraded when we arrived to two doubles. Chose the hotel for its location near the Art Museum and Pikeâ€™s Market (6-8 blocks). Overall, itâ€™s nicely decorated in keeping with the historic neighborhood, but our room was very small. Not enough floor space to even put up the luggage rack or ironing board. The furniture was decent quality, if a bit too large for the space. The bathroom counter was 3/4ths occupied by coffee maker, ice bucket and glasses. Our room card key was temperamental, and changing keys didnâ€™t help. A phone in the hallway to contact the front desk was inoperative. We slept very well, no noise from other guests, and the raised highway nearby sounded like ocean surf, not disturbing. The continental breakfast is very generous, with an excellent waffle maker. The free parking garage, however, is treacherous, with lanes so narrow that turning its blind corners could mean running head-on into a car in the opposite direction. Descending on one corner I had to pull to the side, stop, then back up to return to the lane in order to avoid a collision. If youâ€™ve got a larger car, park somewhere else! Spaces are first-come-first-serve anyway, and we went up 5 floors before finding a spot. The historic neighborhood felt safe, although since it was cold weather there may have been fewer street people around. If youâ€™re willing to put up with a few quirks in an older building, this is a good location for seeing downtown Seattle. You donâ€™t need to walk steeply uphill to access the market and shops overlooking the waterfront. Itâ€™s a half dozen blocks from an Amtrak station and also near the ferries.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR89467157">We came to Seattle to see the Picasso exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum. While parking is not onsite; there is parking located in a parking garage about 2 blocks away at $20 per night. We did find that the hotel's location was such we were able to walk to the museum...about 3 or 4 blocks away. The hotel is also located within the "free bus" section of the city so that if we had wanted to go to any of the many attractions that downtown Seattle has to offer, it would have been very easy for us to do so. The waterfront is also within walking distance...about a block away. The hotel is a small, boutique style hotel and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The king bed was very comfortable and while our room was on the small side, our friends' room across the hall was much larger although their room had a very odd-sized square tub that was quite awkward while the tub in our room was "normal" sized. Diversity in rooms, I guess you could say. The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast with waffle machine, yogurt, various cereals and fruits, etc. The hotel does not have an in-house fitness center but daily passes for the Xplore Fitness Club are available at the front desk for a per day fee. Located just a couple of blocks from the hotel, it comes complete with all the up-to-date weight, free motion equipment and over 20 different kinds of cardio machines. This wasn't an amenity that we took advantage of so can't speak to it. While there isn't an in-house restaurant, there is a restaurant next door to the hotel which will provide limited room service should you wish it. We appreciated the free high speed internet as well as the free local phone calls. This was a hotel where we did NOT feel they were out to gouge us for every cent possible unlike other higher-priced hotels we have stayed at. The staff of the hotel were all outstanding! They all were very friendly and helpful and went beyond our expectations. They all seemed very sincere in their desire to ensure any of our questions were more than adequately answered. I can't remember any recent stay in any hotel where I was so impressed with everyone on the staff of the hotel as I was with the staff of the Pioneer Square Best Western! The hotel was very quiet until about 5 am when the garbage trucks began their pick-up. I was having trouble sleeping so found the noise disconcerting. However, our friends were sleeping soundly and the trucks did not disturb them. This, of course, is not an issue within the hotel's control. Other than this, there did not seem to be any street noise during the night. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting good value in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

There is a good cable selection, free wi-fi or lobby computer use, breakfast is good. I think the bagles are local and fresh. We did have a small room, but it fit our needs. There is city noise, and lights. But, the blinds block out most of it/ The hotel is located in an old building. So, you can hear others' noises. The showers in others rooms in the morning can be heard - if that bothers you ( it woke me up) but ..... that's the only downside. I can look it over. High celings, cute rooms, good staff.

We both slept very well and we never heard a sound from beyond the room. In the morning, the continental breakfast was very nice. Cereal, hardboiled eggs, waffles, muffins, and the coffee was Seattle's Best. Very, very nice. Since we arrived by train, we were without a vehicle. However, outside the hotel entrance, a free bus is available for the ride to the boardwalk. One block to the Pioneer Square and we caught a free bus to the Pike Place Market.

<comment category="positive" id="UR86285291">If you want to explore Seattle's Pioneer Square district, there's no better hotel to do it from than the Best Western Pioneer Square located at the heart of this neighborhood. It's right across the street from the Seattle Underground tour (recommended!) and near restaurants and other amenities. This is a a small, old character hotel though, so you have to be prepared for what comes with that - a slow elevator, no fitness room or pool, no onsite dining other than the breakfast bar, minimal meeting or business facilities. This is not hotel to stay at on business or bring small children to. It reminds me of similar boutique hotels in San Francisco's Union Square, but quieter at night and with fewer other attractions nearby. The front desk staff at the B/W Pioneer Square are top notch. Very friendly and accommodating. Returning there after a day of knocking around, you really felt like you were coming home. The staff next door at the breakfast bar were less warm, but not obnoxiously so. The quest rooms are larger than you'd think in such an old property. This generosity of proportion does not extend to the bathrooms however, which are quite dinky. The room decor is in definite need of updating - you have mismatched bed and window coverings, both of which appear to date from the 80's, on top of old carpet. Our room was quite long, with perhaps eight feet of empty floor between the bed and and armoire in which perched a 26" CRT television. You practically needed opera glasses to watch it. Updating the rooms and in-room amenities would greatly improve the property. These are minor complaints, and on the whole we really enjoyed our stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR84843008">We checked in on a busy Sunday; NFL football was about to kick off and the hotel had been full the night before. We were assured our room by 3 PM and true to their word, our deluxe room was a pleasant surprise. For an old hotel, the room was better than expected. It was large and brightly appointed with clean, modern carpeting and nice furniture. The beds were comfortable and the lighting good. The bathroom is stocked with high end Neutrogena toiletries. The TV is old and the picture a tad fuzzy. Letâ€™s hope new flat screens are on the way. Parking is at the Butler Garage, a 12 story parkade located a block and a half from the hotel. Not bad considering the age and location of the hotel. Our room was quiet, even though it faced the main street. We slept well. If you have many electronic gadgets which may need charging, bring a power bar as electrical outlets are scarce. Other TripAdvisor reviews of poor internet service proved true. It was intermittent at best. We called the 1-800 service and received little help. We were on vacation, so not such a big deal but a business traveller may not share our sense of charity. The gentleman who checked us out was genuinely concerned and promised to follow up with their provider. The breakfast room has about 12 small clothed tables and the food is excellent.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81984198">This hotel reminded me of the elegant Fairmont heritage hotel in Victoria, BC only with a French balcony.While the outside looks turn of the century the interior is immaculate with all the modern convieniences including a massage shower. Unfortunately no pool or jacuzzi. Free continental cold breakfast where I made myself hot waffles. We asked for a fridge and one was delivered to our room in minutes. There is a grocery store 2 blocks from the hotel and a Market Place IGA 2 blocks from Pikes' Place. Next door is a spa/salon in case your feet need pampering after walking 3 blocks to Pike's Place where yes, they acutally do throw fish and sells Market Spice tea. There are 3 floors of boutiques beneath the food sellers. It's 2 block to the Art Museum. If you haven't been to Seattle take the underground tour located across the street and have fun while you learn the history of Seattle. We walked 1 block from the hotel down to Alaska way, the street that stretched accross the waterfront (Pier 50) and walked to Ivar's where the best (white) clam chowder in the world is served. Try the fish and chips with a cup of clam chower both use the same receipe from 1938 when the restaurant opened. The hotel provides maps This hotel is located in the "free bus" area.The next day we took the bus outside the hotel door and after a tour of the International District headed down Alaska way to to pier 91 where our Holland America ship awaited.

If you absolutely must have wi-fi in your room, you might want to consider elsewhere. I was never able to use the Internet on any device from my room, and others I spoke to had the same experience.

<comment category="positive" id="UR79923480">My girlfriend and I stayed at the BW Pioneer Square from the 7th of September until the 10th. We found the hotel to be an older style hotel, but to be expected as it had been around longer than anyone who knows how to use a computer and is reading this! The hotel was clean inisde however... our room was almost flawless. Room was a simple king bed room. Very clean, the TV worked and had good color. Shower, toilet and sink were all clean, as well the wi-fi worked great, so I wrote many reviews on local sight's from there in the late evening! The area around the hotel is quite nice, even during the night. The earlier reviews said it was 'sketchy'. I did not find this, however my partner did. I don't think women would be in danger in this area at night however, as the vagrants of the area seem to be quite pleasant, and ask for change sometimes, but always quietly, not agressively.

<comment category="positive" id="UR79833598">We booked on the Internet for a queen small room and by morning we found the room was much too small...so I talked to the desk and they upgraded us to a wonderful larger room with a small iron patio...it was great. The building retains it's old character but provides modern comfort. The staff are fantastic. The location is a stones throw from the Underground tour in Pioneer square and an wasy walk to Pikes Market and other attractions. There are many great eating spots nearby including a very good Italian restaurant right next door. The breakfast was very good with a great view of the street outside. Overall it reminded me of my stay in the Best Western Eiffel Tower in Paris. The parking is a block up the street and secure but be prepared to pay $20 per 24 hr period. I will stay here everytime I return to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR79771220">Needed a place to stay close to Pioneer Square for business, and this hotel was recommended. Staff was knowledgeable, upbeat and accommodating. Room was unusually shaped, but space was adequate, and I liked the quaint feeling. The breakfast included was usual for this chain, so the only complaint I had was that the room was somewhat crowded, but the staff attempted to make up for this by clearing tables quickly and helping where they could. Would stay there again for business or leisure travel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR78701993">The Best Western at Pioneer Square was a real treat for us staying before and after an Alaskan cruise. I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again. It was a real treat and a step back in time, since it is an historical hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR78697533">I recently stayed here for 1 night over the September Long Weekend. This is possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It is grungy, doesn't smell nice, in a terrible location - its next to a bad area (my gf was yelled at twice by bums on the street coming out of the hotel); the service staff (particularily the Manager) is rude, and tried to overcharge us when we went to leave - we had booked for 3 nights then want to check out after one night given the conditions (our opinion). For Less than what this place costs you can go down the street to near Safeco field (hotel will be obvious) and stay in a beautiful new, modern hotel with a pool, hotub and beautiful rooms, also a safer location. We thought we were getting a good room as Best Western is typically a safe bet - we recently stayed in their New York location which was pretty good. Even if they didn't overcharge me by $61, I would think it is only fair to let other travellers know about this place. Avoid if possible. One positive - it has a waffle iron, which isnt terrible.<topic>none</topic>

It is a small clean 100 year hotel. The room was comfortable and clean. Bed was great. Served a wonderful complimentary breakfast including boiled eggs, cereal, fruit and toast.The staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable. It is across the street from the harbor with plenty of great places to eat. Within easy walking of Pike's Market.

<comment category="negative" id="UR75840854">My husband and I arrived at the Pioneer Square Hotel for our anniversary for 4 nights and 5 days. The staff provided us with a bottle of champagne and snacks. It was an incredibly nice welcome for us. The room was older and a a little outdated but was comfortable. Oh - and the elevator is extremely slow. The hotel provides a free breakfast but after the first day of trying the continental breakfast we decided to skip it the rest of the trip. It was difficult navigating to get our breakfast in a little space with many people. The breakfast was standard continental fare. The hotel is about 7 blocks from Pike Place Market and downtown. Many of the streets are steep and uphill. If I chose to do it over, I would have chosen a hotel closer to the Market. Overall we had a good stay at the Pioneer.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR75110642">This is a centrally located, heritage hotel with lovely rooms and a deluxe continental breakfast! Having traveled to Seattle many times before, we thought it was time to stay in another area other than beside the Pike Place Market. The BW in Pioneer Square was well-appointed and full of heritage character and ambiance. Unlike other BWs, this hotel has style and grace with comfort to boot. We didn't need to pay for parking, for we were able to find free street parking after 6pm, and the parking is free on Sundays, too. The location was great for taking in old Seattle, the Underground Tours, Chinatown, right beside Safeco and Qwest stadiums, the waterfront stores and restaurants. The staff were very kind and helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR72051323">Nice hotel in a "real" part of Seattle. Rooms clean, breakfast great (if a little crowded at times). Easy walking distance of fishermans wharf and plenty of bars and restaurants. We were catching the ferry after our two days and you couldn't be better located. One slight downside is that the area has its share of down and outs so be prepared for frequent panhandlers. Just around the corner is the underground tour - well worth a try for the entertainment /comedy value as much as the educational aspect.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR69788709">Noise from police sirens, buses, load music and a crying baby in a nearby room. Soft lumpy beds. Our upgraded room with a view looked onto a street where homeless people slept. This hotel should not be in the Best Western group. The staff didnt care when I said that I had had a bad night. Also parking is $20 and you have to walk a few blocks away. We did not feel safe late at night in this area coming back from the parking lot. I would not recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68688811">We checked into Best Western, Pioneer Square, Seattle late in the night, weary from a long day of travel and flights. The gentleman on the front desk greeted us with a smile, and informed us that he had upgraded us to one of the beautiful rooms on the 4th floor of the hotel. This was a very pleasant surprise, and very much appreciated. Our room overlooked a quiet street, by way of 4 huge double windows along one wall. The furnishings were top quality, including a three seater plush velvet lounge plus a single period style tapestried chair. Our bed was huge and comfortable, with bedside tables and lamps on either side. Plenty of storage space could be found in the large wardrobe and chest of drawers, and a large screen TV was enclosed in a wall unit. The light fittings were of the federation era, in beautiful cream coloured leadlight, with not only wall fixtures but also free standing lamps at either end of the room. In an alcove at one end was a round table with two twisted timber chairs, and as well there was a desk by the wall for workspace. The bathroom was also federation style with beautiful fittings, a large mirror, excellent water pressure from the shower which was housed in a large bathtub. The airconditioning was perfect and could be manually controlled by the guests in the room, and the large windows also opened, if you prefer fresh air from the bay. The room itself had 10 foot ceilings and all trimmings were of top quality red timber, with carpet throughout and tiles in the bathroom. The housekeeping staff were so quiet and unobtrusive that we didn't know they were around unless we saw them in the corridors. We had a nice continental breakfast each morning, which included all kinds of small pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, toasts and various breads, waffles which can be made by guests in the waffle maker, plus a variety of coffee and large assortment of teas. The dining room staff kept the tables cleared, the coffee urns full, and were obliging to any guests requirements. Our concierge organised taxies for us with ease, and was helpful with advice about the general area and any queries we had about restaurants or getting around Seattle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants trouble-free accommodation within a nice environment where I believe the needs of even a demanding guest would be satisfied. We have travelled the world extensively and visited 15 different countries, some more than once, and Best Western, Pioneer Square, exceeded our expectations at a very reasonable price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68275846">Staff was very helpful, engaging. Rooms were spacious, clean. A little dated, then again it is located in Pioneer Square, so it fits. Close to many downtown Seattle attractions - underground tour, shopping, mall. McDicks right around the corner for midnight snacks - that's key. Can get a little seedy in Pioneer Square at night, and paying for parking is a pain, but the hotel is worth it. Plus they're a lot cheaper than most hotels near by, so that makes up for it. Definitely recommend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR67947169">Location, location, location. This place is in the oldest, most interesting part of town. Two blocks from a ferry port. In walking distance of world-renown Pike's Place Market. Close to Chinatown, sports venues. No on-site parking, and the off-site parking is expensive. This is a face-lifted old hotel. No pool. The Italian restaurant at the water-end of the street was excellent, also the New Orleans place near the parking garage. A few panhandlers, but relatively few for such a funky neighborhood. If you're trying to get in by car, the front desk guys do not drive into work and their well-meaning helpfulness was more hassle than help. You don't need a car here. If you can't walk, things are close. A cab is cheaper than a private car, and mass transit here is very good-- they even have a monorail.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR65502933">My mother, my best friend and myself took a 4 day trip to Seattle. We wanted to stay at a hotel within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The Best Western Pioneer Hotel exceeded our expectations. We had a lovely room on the 2nd floor with two beds and a little juliette balcony. The front desk staff were accommodating and the bellmen were great on giving us direction. We were close to everything we wanted to see and were able to walk everywhere. Their parking lot (we were told) was a block and a half away. Well really it was just a 2 min walk and a lot closer than we imagined. The "blocks" were not "true" blocks. The garage was completely secure with a gate that closed at night, so only people with a pass could have access. We felt very comfortable leaving our car there. Yes, the area had some homeless around, but we were never bothered by them and felt completely safe at night. There was even a Starbucks 20 feet away for our morning latte! We went on the underground tour which was awesome and where we had to meet was only about 25 steps away. Soooo close. Lots of restaurants near by. We walked to the piers easily and went to Pike Place Market. The market was about a 15 minute walk. No big deal. Walking there we got to see all the old historic buildings along the way. The whole area is wonderfully historic including the Pioneer Square Hotel. We will definately stay at the Pioneer Square Hotel again if we go back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR61907793">I was in Seattle for a conference and stayed at the Crown Plaza for 4 nights on my company's dime - I planned to stay a couple extra days but didn't want to pay the Crowne Plaza rate so I went with the Pioneer Square Hotel - after searching the web for an inexpensive hotel and found the PS at about half the price. And what a pleasant surprise! I loved the history, the pictures of old Seattle hanging in the lobby and the stairs - the Crowne Plaza had nothing on this place. And it was a block from the waterfront - shops, ferries, restaurants - and a short bus ride from Seattle Center. And they also had an abundant continental breakfast - make-it-yourself waffles, bagels, cold cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc, etc. Crowne Plaza had squat - except if you wanted to pay for it! The room was clean and well-kept, and with the recently stained woodwork, seemed as if it had all been remodeled recently. Last, but not least, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The only issue I had was with the recently stained woodwork/furniture - which was beautiful - but the odor was pretty bad. Luckily, the windows opened so I was able to air the place out.<topic>none</topic>

We got a very good price for our two rooms. I was very suprised at how beautifully decorated the hotel and rooms were, very clean, provided delicious breakfast with waffles. The staff, including Michael at the front desk, was exceptionally friendly and helpful.

<comment category="positive" id="UR54196518">I usually stay by the Public Market, but this was fantastic. The hotel is small, quaint, totally clean and quiet, with a little European-like breakfast room. You can ask the concierge anything! It rained during my 2 day stay. Not only did I receive an umbrella each day, but everything downtown was walkable or close to free ride, bus or train. Restaurants and bars are close for evening meals and nightcaps; I felt safe on my own. I discovered the Pioneer Square underground Transit Tunnel stop 2 blocks up from the hotel, and the free bus from there to the International District (Uwajimaya just across the street) one stop away. This is the same station for the train to the airport, about a half hour trip for $2.50 (only detriment a long walk to the terminal at the end). The hotel is super for staff, service, quiet, convenience, and proximity to downtown and airport by foot or public transportation. I couldn't have asked for more.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR53141328">Overall the hotel was not a bad one. The thing that turned us off about the trip was the location of the hotel. While staying there my family got approached by homeless people everyday, at least 4 times a day while we walked around the Pioneer District. Enough to make you feel uncomfortable with a baby in tow. Also on the last night of our stay, my father got propositioned by a homeless woman on his way back from the parking garage alone. The bell men at the hotel were very friendly, and the rooms were clean. Breakfast was average, and nothing to write home about. Then again though, it was free. If we were to go to Seattle again, I would spend more money to stay somewhere else. The savings that this hotel offers compared to the more expensive ones downtown were not worth it. This was the first Tripadvisor.com rating that I truly felt was over-rated and incorrect.<topic>none</topic>

Everyone, without exception, was friendly and helpful. The hotel is located close to Pike Place and downtown, definitely walking distance and the weather was exceptional for this time of year and that helped a lot. The only drawback was the area is a little sketchy at night, so I'd recommend being aware of your surroundings in the evening.

<comment category="positive" id="UR48855717">We just got back from a weekend stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square in Seattle and the stay was beyond my expectations. During our last visit, we booked a hotel for a similar price and it was a complete dump so when I was able to book this hotel for a very reasonable rate with my CAA discount, I wasn't expecting too much. The hotel was in a great location, lots of places to eat and drink in the area plus close to some great places like the Crab Pot on the waterfront. The staff that we encountered during our stay were all so nice and friendly. The room was large and very clean with a nice big bathroom and tub! It was quiet, we never heard a single noise while in our rooms. The breakfast that is included was ok, nothing spectacular but lots to choose from with waffles, bagels, cereal, eggs, etc. The hotel is also in the "ride free" zone so you can ride the bus for free. We also walked and took a cab to the main shopping area and it is super close. Overall, nothing but good things to say and we will be back for sure! One thing, if you stay here and looking for something fun to do at night, the Comedy Underground is a very short 2 minute walk from the hotel and for $15, we got to see 2 comedians and it was a great time!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR47175081">We booked the hotel room two days before our weekend to Seattle and got two of the last rooms the weekend of a Seattle Seahawks game. This hotel is within walking distance to both Qwest field and Safeco field. It was the perfect location for out of town Seahawk fans! While we didn't take advantage, it was also quite close to the Seattle shopping district. My only complaint is that there was no hotel parking available by the time we checked in, so had to park on the street which was less than desirable. The hotel is quite old and has so much character. Our room was one of the smallest in the hotel, but it was fine for a one night stay. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. A free paper awaited us on our Sunday morning, which we read enjoying the complimentary hotel breakfast. It is close to the Interstate, but we did not notice much noise within the hotel. It is also within walking distance to the harbour and Pike's Place market. We headed to Anthony's Pier for dinner on Saturday night. The food was fantastic and would definitely recommend going there for a meal. The view is spectacular! I would definitely stay here again for trips into Seattle to watch sporting events. The proximity to Qwest field CANNOT be beat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46768714">I have only positive things to say about this hotel. Our rooms were quite large, quiet, and clean. The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful. The included breakfast was an extended Continental style with make-your-own waffles that were very good. The hotel is located in an 1890's street-front building that is on the National Register -- very cozy surroundings two blocks from the Elliott Bay waterfront, 1/2 block from Pioneer Square, and a comfortable walk to the stadiums. The hotel is also within the Free Ride zone - we caught a free bus over to the Westlake Center, picked up the Monorail (2 bucks) to the Space Needle. Took about 15 minutes total.<topic>none</topic>

They got us someone to help with our luggage; great directions for parking and restaurants in area. Breakfast was nice with real dishes. Area was quiet for being downtown. Great weather also helped. Rooms not big but for a one night stay plenty of room and we also had a rollaway in room which was very comfortable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46578869">The Pioneer Square Best Western greatly enhanced our 5-day stay in Seattle! The interior rooms were quiet, spacious, comfortable and clean. The housekeeping was unobtrusive and thorough. The concierge service was outstanding; they recommended excellent airport transportation and car rental services, and provided precise directions. The front desk personnel were memorable, from the initial reservations assistance to the swift checkout. And the extensive breakfasts provided a delicious beginning to our days of exploration! The location was perfect for our activities along Elliott Bay, in central Seattle, Pioneer Square and the International District. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46469312">We stayed here for two nights at the start and finish of a longer holiday. The hotel is comfortable and clean and check in is efficient and friendly. The location is very good - an easy walk into the main areas and in very easy reach of the bars and shops in the Pioneer Square area. We receommend Michellis, an Italian bar/restuarantright opposite the hotel for good food and a great selection of beer and wine. We walked to the station in order to take a train to Vancouver and this was fine. The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast which is a pretty good start to the day. On our second visit we were upgraded to a suite - which was a welcome treat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR45878052">The hotel itself was a typical chain hotel. The room was comfortable. The staff was very helpful holding my luggage before and after my stay. I walked from the train station to the hotel. It was kind of a long walk but managable for anyone with resonable fitness and good wheeled luggage or a backpack. I'd probably choose this hotel if I were to do it again. The location was good if you don't mind a little walking. The pier was about a five to ten minute walk and the market was about 10 minutes. A great BBQ place is about a minute walk away in the square. I felt a little uncomforable walking alone at night as a single female but during the day it was fine. Overall I was impressed with my experience at the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

Check in was smooth an professional, the staff courteous, and the guest rooms were nicely appointed. This hotel is a historic landmark in Seattle's famous Pioneer Square, and they have managed to keep up to date with current hotel amenities while maintaining the flavor of the neighborhood. They offer a very nice complimentary breakfast, complimentary internet access, and have an agreement with a pay parking garage nearby that allows for in-and-out service with a scan card.<topic>none</topic>

It has the charm and warmth of a bygone era with all the modern conveniences. Folks at the front desk were friendly, helpful and professional and our room was certainly large enough, very clean and comfortable. There was a bit of traffic noise but it certainly didn't bother us. The continental breakfast was top notch with excellent variety and everything fresh and tasty. This hotel offered excellent value and we would certainly stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

Staff member Mike was knowledgeable and helpful. Complimentary breakfast offered was much better than other same category chain hotels. Only downside to my stay was that the room window faced the side alley, with loud noises late at night that sounded like a garbage dumpster was being emptied.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR40155734">I would not stay here again, nor recommend it. Where to startâ€¦ Well, Iâ€™ll admit it was our fault to reserve so last minute on a busy weekend, but the rate of $200 tax for the first night compared to $95 the next night almost seemed criminal. The value was simply horrible. Iâ€™m kicking myself now for paying so much for a room that was clearly no better than one at Motel 6. And if the cost wasnâ€™t bad enough, upon arrival we were informed it was also the smallest room in the entire hotel, something they did NOT mention over the phone. When I expressed displeasure, I was offered no recourse, no discount, nothing. The $20/night parking fee was also an unpleasant surprise. Also upon arrival, the initial welcome left a rude, very negative feeling in general. We are a younger couple, and as such, it felt we were treated in a condescending manner. For example, the parking garage key â€“ I was told â€œItâ€™s worth $50 to us, so itâ€™s worth $50 to you, lose it and it will be charged to your credit cardâ€�. Not friendly or welcoming at all. Once we made it to the room, we realized just how small it was. There was about one foot of clearance all around the bed, and barely enough room for luggage. Oh, and lets not forget the spectacular view of a brick wall outside. $200/night for this? Never again. We settled for it anyways due to a long day of driving and just generally being too tired to make an issue of it. Amenitiesâ€¦ All your Best Western standards were there. The complimentary breakfast was your usual bagels, etc. The wireless internet though, was extremely slow and almost unusable. Overall, this is an old hotel albeit well maintained, but in a less desirable area of downtown Seattle (everything is uphill walking from this hotel). Itâ€™s a fair distance from any attractions, and also right next to a major viaduct, so I assume some rooms are likely quite noisy. $95/night (peak) sounds acceptable, anything more and youâ€™re paying far too much. I expected better from a Best Western.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39961071">Where here now on the 2nd of 3 nights. The hotel is clean with a very nice breakfast, and location is excellent - one short block to the Underground Tours; across the street from the ferry's (take the Bainbridge Island ferry for a beautiful, very inexpensive trip to the Island - or another); about 8 blocks (nice walk) to Pike Place Market; a couple blocks to Elliott Bay shops. Everything is close and if you enjoy to walk just a little it's the perfect location and a great value. We love to find good value and boutique type hotels, especially in great locations. We highly recommend this. The only issue I have is our room is near the elevated highway and there is more noise at night than I care for (but ear plugs do the trick). But the room is very clean and it's a nice older hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR38078683">We were in Seattle for a wedding and we arrived late morning. A room was not ready and we needed to freshen up and hang up our clothes that we were wearing for the wedding. The front desk staff let us use their facilities to freshen up and gave us wooden hangers for our clothes. Right as we were giving our luggage to be stored, the front desk person told us she found a room that was ready for us. This historical building has a lot of charm to it. The rooms were clean, quaint and all the modern amenities. We were within walking distance to many of the sites, ferries, restaurants and night life. Breakfast is included with the room. It is your typical continental breakfast, fruit, yogurt, breads, muffins, hard boil eggs, cereal, juices, coffee, waffles. Whether we needed a taxi, directions or recommendations, the front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We love Seattle and we will be back. We will definitely stay at this hotel again too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR37697241">We have stayed at the Pioneer Square Best Western 3 times and always have had a great experience. The last trip was before and after a cruise. We arrived at 3 am due to a late flight- but the concierge had a car waiting for us. We had booked an out of town trip based on faulty info about public transportation - but he found transportation for us. We couldn't fit souvenir arrows in our suitcases, he had them shipped the next day. Any of these things could have caused tired, stressed travelers to melt down, but each one just turned into another nice impression of the Pioneer Square Best Western. It is in a fantastic location, the rooms are terrific, and the people are phenomenal!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR37472726">I like the Best Western brand, because so often, the hotel is traditional to the setting, and the properties are nicely kept. This was certainly true here, and a great find! Pioneer Square is more-or-less the heart of what's happening in Seattle, right in the middle of or within easy walking distance of an endless array of sights and shopping. A great, attractive, comfortable, clean room and bathroom, and even fresh apples waiting in the room. My location request had been incorporated with no difficulty. Because of a harried exit from home, I had forgotten to pack my very necessary hair spray in my checked luggage, and I forgot toothpaste as well. Due to airline difficulties, I arrived too late to buy these items. When I asked for toothpaste, they had it, which was not surprising. But I then said, jokingly, "I don't suppose you have any hair spray back there, do you?" And the young man said, "I don't know. I'll look." He opened the cabinet door behind him, and there was a short row of little hair spray bottles! ! ! Doing the happy dance, for sure! There is a restaurant next door which serves lunch and dinner - - and I think they deliver as "room service" until 10:00 p.m. Did not use that service. Free breakfast is available in the hotel breakfast room, with a nice selection of "continental" items - - plus do-it-yourself waffles! When I go back, I'll go down for breakfast a little earlier, so as not to get stuck in the "waffle line." Apparently we all thought everyone else would be eating early, but there was a late rush just before the serving stopped. Everyone still got everything they wanted, but we had to take turns! ! ! (The second morning we were catching the train to Vancouver, and ate breakfast on the train.) Look at the hotel website, and you will see this thoroughly updated hotel in a great location, with really nice people operating it. My traveling companion met me there the second night, and we were both very pleased with this choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR36099530">This hotel is a big disappointment. While the staff is nice, our room has an intense moldy smell, lots of traffic noise, and lots of street lighting slipping through the curtains at night. This part of Seattle is very "seedy" as well. The smell of urine is very strong along practically every street and alley. The room is also small. I would recommend staying away from this place!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35698438">As we parked our car in the unloading zone in front of the hotel, I was grew concerned. Walking into the hotel and then seeing our room I realized we'd be just fine. This is a terrific older hotel that is located in the old original downtown area of Seattle; an area that the city could do a lot more to improve. We were staying 3 nights and were informed our room had been upgraded. We were on the 4th floor with a small balcony. The room had double-paned glass which kept out most of the street noise, but if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs. I didn't need them. Our room was very clean, updated inside, and pleasant and the whole hotel is non-smoking which is an absolute joy. The Underground Tour (which I recommend) is only a block away. What this means, however, with at least 2 homeless missions within blocks away, is that the homeless congregate in that area as there are a multitude of tourists who come to see the old buildings and take the tour. I never felt endanged by any of them as we tromped back and forth, however, you have to ignor the requests for money. The parking structure suggested by the hotel seems much more secure than other parking nearby. You can park elsewhere if you want. The parking rate is a flat fee and you can come and go as much as you want/need. There is a city bus that stops right in front of the hotel that will take you over to the International District (which has an amazing store with all things Asian and many Asian fast food stands within). We were able to use buses in the "free zone" to get to almost everywhere we wanted to go for free. It was impossible to try and park near Pike Place Market, so the buses were very helpful--although you must walk several blocks from the free bus dropoff point. Also the free buses along the front shoreline road stop right in front of the hotel. The breakfast was okay. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs for protein and bagels/cream cheese and make-it-yourself waffles provide the carbs. There is a Starbucks a block away and several small restaurants in the immediate area. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel as it is a great value for the money. My only complaint is the one elevator. Unlike where I live, there is nothing that states when it was last inspected inside the elevator itself and it had a bounciness to it that made us feel a bit wary. That said, however, it worked and it would not deter a recommendation or future stay. I gave a 3/5 for location because the location has both pluses and minuses. I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35678104">Seattle is a tourist-friendly city, and Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel was a great base from which to enjoy it all. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Waterfront, in the middle of Pioneer Square's attractions, and just a few blocks from Safeco/Qwest Fields. One block up is 42 floor Smith Tower, with a 360 degree view observation deck. And 1st Avenue, one block up from BW, has all kinds of good restaurants. The New Orleans Creole Restaurant on 1st had terrific music by the New Orleans Quintet on Monday night, along with wonderful, reasonably priced food. There is a 'free bus' area to a lot of Seattle's attractions, including Pike Market, Sculpture Garden, Monorail to the Space Needle, etc. Several stops are within a few blocks of Best Western. One bus stops right in front of the hotel. Pioneer Square BW has a great free morning breakfast - make your own waffles w/strawberries, bagels, yogurt, fruit, etc. The lobby is comfortable and our room/bathroom were fine. There was no street noise at night, even though you're in close proximity to the highway. We parked our car in the Butler Garage, 1-1/2 blocks away, and left it there for the 3 day stay. No need to drive, with the free buses, monorail, cheap bus fare out-of-area. The concierge at the BW door on Tuesday morning was extremely helpful with directions and suggestions. We're looking forward to going back, and staying at the Pioneer Square Best Western when we do. Be forewarned that all of Seattle is overpriced, but once you adjust to that, you will love the city!<topic>none</topic>

It is close to the Amtrak station, which was nice for an early train to Vancouver.The free bus picked up right outside the front door of the hotel and we took it one direction to Pike Market and the other direction to the Amtrak station. Pike Market was closer than we thought, so we walked back in the evening. The room was big and had a balcony. The kids, 5 &amp; 7, loved the continental breakfast with waffles.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34965882">My critera for finding a hotel in Seattle was that it be near the Amtrak station, as we were traveling by train, and this hotel was the closest one I found. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I checked in. Not only is it a beautifully restored old hotel, but it is located within a 10 minute walk of the Amtrak station in a nice historic area of the city. The room was one of the largest rooms I have ever been in in a hotel, and the king size bed was gigantic! The room was nicely furnished with high-speed internet, a coffee pot, hair dryer, iron, and the usual assortment of shampoos, soaps, etc. I wish our stay could have been longer, because the hotel was located in a very interesting and fun area, as well as being convenient to the [free] public transportation to get to other parts of the city. The hotel staff was very pleasant, and upon our checkin, gave us a map of Seattle which enabled us to easily find our way around. The free continental breakfast was very good and much appreciated; make-your-own waffles as well as cereal, muffins, bagels and toast toast were available, served in a cozy room next to the lobby. The lobby, altho small, was comfortable. Because I was only there overnight, I didn't have time to check out what amenities the hotel offered, so I am not sure about many of those things. The photo and the appearance of the hotel doesn't do the hotel justice; you need to go into the lobby to see what a gem it is. I would definately recommend this hotel to a friend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34843248">I stayed at this hotel for four nights while attending a large event at the Convention Center downtown. I found it to be beautifully furnished, clean, quiet, and everything I needed for a relaxing stay. The staff was very helpful with luggage, directions, recommendations, etc. Even though we arrived on a very busy Friday afternoon, it was easy to pull up directly in front of the hotel, unload the luggage, check in, and get the car to the parking garage located just a few blocks away. The staff made this all very smooth. (On a side note, everything is within walking distance, a free bus ride, or a cab ride away, so I would leave the car at home and save the $20 a day in parking if you can.) Breakfast was not elaborate but good and plenty was available (fresh waffles, hard boiled eggs, bagels, muffins, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.) The hotel was a bit of a hike from the Convention Center, but I found the 30 minute walk each morning pleasant. There are also free buses a few blocks away if you don't like to walk that far. Personally, I enjoyed being away from the activity of the large convention hotels at the end of the day and found it the perfect place to stay. When visiting Seattle again, I will definitely stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34558236">We booked this hotel at the last minute for our last two nights in Seattle before returning to Europe. We were very satisfied with the room and price, facilities were good, location excellent - at the end of Downtown, handy for the docks, shops and Pioneer Square district. You can reach it from the harbour area (e.g. cruise, Victoria Clipper ports) by the free downtown trolley. Breakfast was decidedly basic (but at least included), and the first morning very overcrowded - I think a group had come just ahead of us. Business centre allowed me to check internet as necessary without difficulty. Room was on a corner and quite near the overhead freeway but you could also see the water with a little effort! Noisy with the window open but it wasn't so hot that we needed to open it much. Staff willing to be helpful but not obtrusive. Main complaint was that when we wanted to go to the airport they tried very hard to persuade us to take a town car for $5 more than a taxi: but I really couldn't understand why I should want to.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34227461">The staff was great-- very friendly and helpful. I did not expect such personalized service at this price! It had all the amenities and efficiency of a chain hotel with the decor and ambiance of a historic hotel. The location is perfect if you plan to take the ferries or water taxis frequently. It is also very close to excellent restaurants on the waterfront and in Pioneer Square. There is a great view of the city from the observation deck at Smith Tower, just barely up the street. Pikes Market is also a little over a half mile away as well- a pleasant walk. To get to Seattle Center, we walked about half a mile to the monorail station, then took the monorail, which was a fun experience. We also took a cab to Seattle Center one day when we were in more of a hurry (about $10). So, if you absolutely have to be right in the middle of the market/shopping area or near the convention center, this might not be the place for you, but otherwise everything about this hotel was convenient for getting around Seattle. We also liked the fact that it is relatively small, with only four stories. We almost never had to wait for the elevator, and could just easily take the stairs, which made getting in and out of the hotel a breeze. If you are very sensitive to any sounds while you are trying to sleep, you may not want a "city view" room, as the hotel is near the freeway and there is a "saloon" next door, so you will hear road noise and people sitting at the outside tables. But that is part of staying downtown, and it was really not an issue for us.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33823165">We had never been to Seattle and were not sure where to stay in the city. We chose this place on a whim because of its historic downtown location and reasonable price. We definitely made the right choice. The hotel staff is excellent. All the concierges are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The location is awesome. The Underground Tour, the Pier 52 ferry to Bainbridge Island, eclectic shopping, sports stadiums, nature and historic walks, and lively bars and restaurants are literally only a block or two away. Don't miss a tour of the, nearby, public library. It's amazing. Also, a major bus stop is nearby. (We didn't even need to rent a car, thus saving $20.00 per night for parking). As a bonus to history and ghost story lovers, the Pioneer is the only hotel to be found here, the first area to be established by the pioneers of Seattle. If you listen carefully, you will hear great stories about both these elements of old Seattle. Yes, there is quite a bit of panhandling in the area and it became tiresome. However, the good completely outweighed the bad.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32973020">The Best Western at Pioneer is a great little hotel. Donâ€™t go if you are looking for the cookie cutter hotel of the big chains, this is more of a boutique hotel. The â€œfreeâ€� breakfast was more along the lines of a small European hotel without the meat and hard rolls, which matched the feel for the whole hotel. In my opinion the hotel would be fit right in with the boutique hotels of any major European city. Right next to the hotel is a nice saloon which severed mostly local beers and wines, but had the atmosphere of a local â€œgasthausâ€� in Germany or a local pub in England. If you are in Seattle with some free time I would advise you take the â€œUnderground Tour,â€� which is about a block from the hotel. Not overly impressive however very informative. Just around the corner from the hotel up on First Avenue there is a nice little jazz club that has reasonably priced meals and great music, if you like jazz that is. The hotel is with easy walking distance of the waterfront and its associated eateries. Just a short walk north on First Avenue is the famous Pikes Market where you can buy fresh fruit, meat, flowers and fish. If you go to the Market donâ€™t forget your camera as the range of colors is outstanding. Speaking of cameras, vist Kerry Park, which is north of the Space Needle, where you get a wonderful view of the city; I think it is the same view you see from window of Frasierâ€™s window from the TV show of the same name. One doesnâ€™t need a rental car to get there however it is a â€œhikeâ€� up the last few blocks, trust me on that as I hiked it once and about half way up my legs and I agree that I was out of shape and should have taken the rental car. (Testosterone will kill you every time.) They say in the winter when the air is fresh and clear you can see Mt. Rainer in the back ground behind the Space Needle; however I was there in the summer so I just got a hazy view of Mt. Rainer. For the camera buffs I would advise you go to the park right after sun down so you can get a view of the Space Needle and the rest of Seattle all lit-up. If you want to change your daily wear visit Utilikilts on Pioneer Square. They can outfit you with a daily wear kilt in no time. I was much temped to buy one; however, well to be honest I chickened out. All and all the Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel is a great little hotel, right in the heart of old Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

The breakfast buffet is a perfect way to start the day. We took buses everywhere and the location couldn't be more convenient, although Pioneer Square at night is not condusive for strolling the streets, thus the 4-star rating on location. Our room was front streetview, second floor, spacious, clean and so very comfortable. If we come back to Seattle again, this is the place we will stay. The price is right!

<comment category="positive" id="UR32399840">We chose the Pioneer Square for its price and proximity to AMTRAK (it's a $4 cab ride to the station, tip not included). We stayed two nights, one going and one coming. It would take a compelling reason now to choose another Seattle hotel. We got in late the first night and the desk staff could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. We were quickly in our nicely appointed and furnished room and found the extra pillows we had asked for online. The Pioneer is a historic building with the ambiance only found in earlier days. It has had a first class restoration, so you get the best of the old and of the new. The included breakfast is of first quality and generous quantity. A cheerful attendant provides any help you need and boiled eggs provide the protein often missing from such meals. Finally, when I discovered I had left my shaving kit behind and called the hotel they simply checked my address and said they would send it along. At no charge. The Best Western Pioneer Square will be our hotel in Seattle from now on.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR31349745">We chose this hotel for a brief stay before a cruise and were pleased from the moment we walked in. Check-in was easy and the pleasant staff member gave us maps of the area along with the room keys. The hotel is a very short walk from the "Seattle Underground" tour and the Klondike Museum in an historic area with many shops and restaurants. I asked about purchasing wine and flowers to take on our cruise, and another map that detailed the immediate vicinity was given to me and the appropriate shops marked. The staff member suggested waiting to buy the flowers at the Pike Street Market, which was an excellent suggestion. Breakfast was pleasant and included the individual waffle maker, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, pastries and more. Checkout was easy and we were allowed toleave our luggage in their secure storage room while we toured the area after checkout.

I was lucky enough to find the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel for my travel arrangements. I have traveled all over the United States and Europe, I have to say this is the most pleasant hotel and staff I have ever encountered. Michael is always at the front desk to greet us, always smiling, professional and willing to LISTEN to the guests needs and wants. Very uncommon these days!!! The rooms are beautiful remodeled to the original era. The location is fantastic, walking to Pikes Market, the ferrys, surrounded by shops, restaurants and coffee houses. The lobby is very comfortable with great tourist information and a wonderful warming fire to sit and relax by. All of these wonderful attributes, make the Best Western at Pioneer Square in Seattle Wa., an absolute pleasure to continue my trips to Seattle. If it was not for the staff, Michael, in particular I may have stayed at an alternative hotel. In fact on my last trip, there was another hotel in the vacinity, same star value, cheaper in price and I would image other ways, I chose to stay at Best Western Pioneer Square without hesitation because of my wonderful experience. I would also like to mention Katarina, who is always pleasant with a big smile. You are very fortunate to have Michael, who obviously loves his job, torking for you. Thank you again for a wonderful experience!!! Wendy Whitehouse<topic>none</topic>

It seemed like all the staff knew. When we arrived, we found a lavish gift basket including champagne, waiting. The hotel is charming and the service is personal. We return because we always feel welcomed and it is never impersonal. The hotel is within easy walking distance of many activities and the Pioneer Square district is eclectic and fun.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR29528008">The Pioneer Square Hotel is a great place to stay while in Seattle. It is close to the waterfront, Safeco Field, Quest Field, public transit and downtown. The staff is very professional and friendy, the rooms are very comfortable and clean and the breakfast is great too. I have stayed at the Pioneer Square Hotel many times for the last twelve years and still enjoy every visit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR29429988">This was my third stay at this hotel and I wasn't disappointed. It is located in the historic heart of Seattle and has several interesting places nearby, including Pioneer Square itself with its native American totem poles, the Klondyke Goldrush Museum, several of Seattle's famous coffee houses and what must be one of the USA's finest bookshops. There is also a reasonable selection of restaurants within walking distance. The area is not too noisy and felt perfectly safe. The hotel itself is an older building with an individual and historical character. I prefer this style of hotel to very large, more modern but often bland hotels. My room was spacious, spotlessly clean and everything worked. I had suffered a sporting injury immediately before my visit and needed some special assistance, the staff were friendly and extremely helpful. There is no restaurant but there is a breakfast buffet - fairly simple items, cereals, yoghurt, waffles, etc. Sadly, the excellant selection of Torrefazione coffee from the store that used to be nearby is no longer available. This was another enjoyable stay and I would certainly stay there again if I travel to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR28864306">We were right where we wanted to be - walking distance to Pike Place, Pioneer Square, Qwest WaMu Center, waterfront. Our room was ready when we walked in the door early. I loved the old, vintage feeling, wide halls and stairs to our room. The bathroom was spotless, the shower was great. We parked the car and never touched it until we drove home. The neighborhood was quaint with marvelous shops and restaurants. I highly recommend it. It was relaxing not taking taxis and being able to run in and out of our hotel as we went from place to place. The staff was friendly, helpful and ready.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR27779422">While only for one evening my stay was enjoyable. The hotel is easy walking distance from the Amtrak Station and located in one of the oldest and uique areas of Seattle. The hotel is quaint, with the feeling of old world charm. When you enter you attention is drawn to the big easy chairs surrounding the fireplace and then to the beautiful old staircase with the wide, beautiflly carved wooden banister. This decor is carried throughout the hotel, including the rooms. The service was excellant and the staff knowledgeable about the area. I throughly enjoyed my stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR27650755">I was surprised to see how highly this hotel was rated, given the price, but after staying there I agree with all the reviews - SUPERB hotel for the money. The room was really spacious. Decor was OK, depending on what you like, but I don't choose hotels for decor anyway. Best part was the service - the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Also the breakfast was WONDERFUL. With most hotels this price, you just get a 'continental' breakfast - this one had the works: breads, bagels, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, and a waffle machine! Great to be able to have a hearty breakfast before you're heading out for a day's sightseeing... My only criticism is that there may have been a lot of dust under the beds or somewhere, because my allergies were going nuts, but I can't say for sure that was the hotel's fault; it might have been something else triggering my allergies. Also, the parking is a block away (pay parking) but you can pull up in front of the hotel to unload your luggage, check in etc, and then move the car. And the parking lot does have in/out priveleges - you get a pass from the hotel and that way can come and go as you please. You pay for the pass as part of your hotel bill, so you don't have the hassle of paying separately. (I searched online for hotels with parking included, and there didn't seem to be any in this price range, so just remember to add on $20/day for parking. Which may seem a lot, but given how much street parking is, it's not too bad) Oh and somewhere it said there was WiFi, but it's not really WiFi, it's an internet port in your room. I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

It is very conveniently located and the rooms are lovely - full of old charm and style! The only thing that can possibly outdo the charm and character of the hotel itself is the staff. Both visits we were greeted with warm smiles and friendly hello's that continued from each staff member we encountered throughout. They really go above and beyond in the service department! I found the hotel to be quiet and comfortable with all the necessities one would require. I look forward to next year's visit!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26461644">The Best Western Pioneer Square was a wonderfully charming spot right in the middle of all the downtown Seattle action! Our room was very spacious, clean, had many large windows and even a balcony! The antique furnishings were very elegant and luxurious, making me feel like I wasn't staying in a hotel but more like a beautiful bed &amp; breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, we really enjoyed the free fresh waffles and assortment of food in the morning - It was a perfect start to our day out enjoying Seattle. The staff were very friendly and always helped with any questions we had. All in all I was very impressed with this hidden gem! (as we almost missed it - the front looks like a store front).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26291170">I found the location perfect and central. I could easily catch local transportation for day trips (ferries, buslines, and train). I was an easy and comfortable walking distance from everything. I like the fact that the Best Western in Pioneer Square is also walking distance from great restaurants: Italian, Middle Eastern, Thai, Sushi, Pho...all within two blocks of the hotel. The decor is a comfortable elegance. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is wireless service. A big plus because I'm often having to finish business during my stay. Downstairs there is also a computer so you can print out airline or train tickets. Again...a nice extra. I very much appreciated the morning self-serve breakfast of "make your own waffles", bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, and hard boiled eggs. It met all the needs of my somewhat picky eater kids. Finally, I'm an art lover. And I so appreciated being in the heart of the Art District. There are over 30 galleries and artist studios nearby. We happened to stay on an evening that was a "First Thursday Art Walk". The galleries stayed open until 8 PM and many of the artists were on hand to answer questions. The Seattle Art Museum is just a short bus or cab ride away. I have recommended the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel to all my family and friends.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR25099987">My girlfriend and I spend two nights at the Pioneer Square Best Western in January while we were in town for the boat show. I have been staying at the hotel at least once a year since it was renovated in the early 90's. A friend told me about its very competitive rates and close in location to the market/downtown as well as to the stadiums and waterfront. PSH is not the flashiest place in town, meal service is limited to a simple coffee/pastry service, but it is almost always the best value in town--the rooms are as nice as you see in the best western urban niche, and the staff and service are exceptional. I like that it is only a short walk to the the waterfront and stadium district while only a short cab ride to the market and downtown. Parking is limited and off site, but for the price savings it is never an issue to me. there is usually a lot going on in Pioneer Square and only on one Mardi Gras week have I ever found a little late night revelery to be noticed from my room. the best rooms are the ones with balcony's and I always stay in one of them.<topic>none</topic>

The bellman was awesome and the night cleck fun...however the day staff sucks....over charged us on one room and wounldn't honor price......also because of that we check out and went else where....they are still trying to charge me for 4 more nights that we aren't going to be there for...

<comment category="positive" id="UR24378555">The Pioneer Square Hotel is a good location for the attractions in the historical part of Seattle and is close to the ferry service. There are several restaurants nearby that are fun and casual. However, the surrounding area appears to be "home" to several homeless persons, but there were no problems with any harassment. It was not a problem for us. The hotel was recently renovated and is clean with spacious rooms and a reasonable price. Breakfast, though, was mediocre, but we didn't expect anything great. It is well worth considering if you looking for a good hotel in that area of the city.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23990702">My fiancee stayed in Seattle for a romantic three day two night stay. We looked for a hotel that was close enough to walk to our favorite spots within the city and decided to stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. It is within walking distance from both the Seattle Aquarium, Pike place market, and many great restaurants. Upon first arriving I had trouble working the card key lock but the bell hop was very friendly and assisted us getting into our room to relax. He finished showing us our room and quietly left us to start our night. Our wake up call came in on the dot which, for my hotel experience was rare but preferred. The continental breakfast was served pipping hot! Fresh Belgian waffles with coffee for my fiancee and myself. They had fresh fruit, yogurt and much more which we couldn't stuff ourselves with. However, I did sneak some fruit for later in the day. The staff was very polite and the food was never empty nor cold. After a day out we returned to a well turned down room. The front desk was more then happy to sneak a bottle of champagne into our room while we were out so I could surprise my fiancee per my request by phone. We relaxed in our room the remainder of the night. Our room had a balcony overseeing the front entrance which made it nice to watch the foot traffic of the city. After spending weekends at other hotels in the past, their prices never were justified with what we received. All of the Amenities at Pioneer Square Hotel were more then adequate and my fiancee will most definitely return. The room was superb, the staff was more then helpful, friend and went well above and beyond. If you plan on going to Seattle ANYTIME soon, I would highly recommend sneaking into this wonderful hotel and staying awhile. You won't regret it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23978245">I had a really positive experience at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. The bed was very comfortable, which is a big plus for me. It was also very quiet. Perhaps it was the time of year, I don't know. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The concierge Greg is great! Very helpful and friendly. He greeted us with a smile and sent us off with one! I also really liked their extensive continental breakfast - the belgian waffles were a plus. It saved us money on eating breakfast out. I really appreciate that. One final note, Pioneer Square is one of the nicest parts of Seattle. It's unique, with streets lined with independent stores, and is filled with beautiful architecture. This hotel is right where you want to be. Right in Pioneer Square and very close to the waterfront (hint: eat at Ivar's Acres of Clams!!). I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23917426">I booked a city view room last minute for my husband's 50th birthday. I was relieved and surprised that the reservations were correct since it was such short notice. I also had a very last minute request...that there be something waiting in the room for my husband (card, balloons, wine, etc.). I was delighted when we arrived that the hotel staff greeted my husband with a "Happy Birthday" and when we entered our room there was a chilled bottle of sparkling wine awaiting us! It was perfect! We had a king bed in a city view room with a wonderful little balcony. It was a bit chilly, but we still managed to enjoy the balcony for awhile. The bed and pillows were great. No problems with the wireless internet. It was just a wonderful stay! We were within walking distance of everything...had a nice seafood dinner (McCormick &amp; Schmick's) and visited several breweries. We had fallen in love with this hotel on a previous visit (within walking distance to Qwest and Safeco!) so we knew of the perfect little martini bar (Martin's Martini Heaven) just across the street from our hotel. Wonderful way to end the evening. Was a quick trip, but this hotel made it comfortable, relaxing, convenient, and romantic....just perfect!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR23019582">We were coming by train from Portland and the Best Western Pioneer Square is conveniently located, just a six block walk from the Amtrak station. Also a good location for exploring Seattle. It's easy to get to Pike Place Market Place, restaurants and downtown locations on foot or by bus. Pioneer Square is worth exploring and has a great bookstore, the Elliot Bay Book Company. What we didn't know before we got there is that there is an elevated freeway that runs above the part of the waterfront that is immediately west of the hotel. That area of the waterfront is, as a consequence, very noisy and not very attractive. We were there in July and it was hot enough that we needed the air conditioning provided by the room's older window unit. Thankfully, the air conditioner blocked the freeway noise. I wouldn't stay there at other times of year with nothing to block the noise. Since other reviewers describe their rooms as quiet, maybe there are quieter rooms further down Yesler street from the freeway. Or maybe some people are better at tuning out that kind of noise. Aside from the noisy location, this hotel was fine; clean, comfortable enough, reasonably priced when compared to other hotels further north. Breakfast was fine though nothing memorable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21980886">The Pioneer Square is a pleasant smallish hotel in an interesting corner of Seattle. Comfortable rooms and bathroom, if oddly shaped and not very large, which were fine for a short stay. The breakfasts are limited but acceptable and the breakfast room is enlivened by the sight of fellow guests attempting to work out the waffle maker. Pleasant staff and reception, apparantly family run and up to the usual Best Western standards, clean and well appointed. Several restaurants nearby but we suggest avoiding the closest, al Boccalino, a rather pretentious but unexceptional Italian 3 or 4 doors away. Expensive for what you get; we were told very offhandedly that they had no Washington wines." We are an Italian restaurant!" At $60 to $100 for bottles one would pay no more than Â£10 for in a UK off licence- forget it.<topic>none</topic>

We stayed for 4 nights, left to go to Victoria BC, then came back for 2 more nights. The hotel has "old world" charm. The room decor is very well done - down to the drapery, carpet and nice artwork on the walls. The bathrooms are modern and nicely sized. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless. The linens were fresh and spotless as well. The fresh fruit and free bottled water was a nice touch and very much appreciated. The breakfast room was clean and always stocked with the daily offerings. The coffee was good and the waffles were addicting. Even the elevator was fast and roomy. You don't realize how much you appreciate that until you go to another hotel where the elevators are sloooooow and tiny (as they were in our Victoria BC hotel). The Pioneer Square area is lively and exciting with lots of little shops and restaurants. We walked around the area at night and didn't feel unsafe. Other people mentioned street people as problematic. This is a fact of life in any large city, but none of the street people were aggressive or abusive. Just a block away, they offer a tour of Seattle Underground which was interesting. Pizza at Mario's was delicious. Dinner at Elliott's Oyster House at Pier 56 was wonderful. We found Seattle to be a great city with friendly people who are helpful and polite to tourists.

<comment category="positive" id="UR14151478">This is a very old and colorful area. Yesler Way where this hotel is location is on the original skid row. This was orginally a muddy road that logs were dragged (skidded) up to get to Yesler's mill. Thus, the term skid row was was given to this area. Loggers and millworkers being lonely at times liked to frequent the business that sprung up around this area. They also got a bit thirsty!!! I previously lived in Seattle for about 15 years. I rode or walked by the hotel several times and never gave it a thought. Was looking for a hotel close to the train station, by the bus stop, and close to the waterfront. You step out the door of the hotel and turn left walk about a block and your at the ferry terminal on the waterfront. You walk out the hotel door and practically next door is the bus stop for FREE bus service within the Downtown core. The Klondike Gold Rush museum is also in the area. They sometimes offer free walking tours that include a trip to the top of the Smith Tower (originally the tallest building on the West Coast). If you walk north up 1st Ave about 6-7 blocks &amp; at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and the Pike Place Market. The rooms were small, but the hotel was built in the early 1900. The room was immaculate, and because of something we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with city view. We got in about 9pm and walked to the waterfront. Ivars is open until late. We found a really good deal. They extend their Happy Hour on Fridays til closing. Well drinks, wine are $3.00. Limited menu but I got fried oysters for $4.95, can get Fish &amp; chips also for 4.95 with view table looking out as the ferry terminal. We will definely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle. The most beautiful city on the planet!!!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11630625">Spent 4 wonderful nights in Seattle. Caught a Seahawks game, and did some sightseeing. The hotel staff was professional. The free continental breakfast was nice, and the room was comfortable for a family of four. The only flaw I found. Our high speed internet connection did not work in the room. But, they have a computer in the conference room downstairs for guests so not a big issue. The area in Pioneer Square was nice and to all of the shops we hit on 1st Ave. Despite some older reviews concerning the homeless people we never encountered any aggressive homeless person nor did we ever feel threatened. The restaurant next to the hotel (Julies Garden) was good with big portions. But, our spot was the Pho restaurant across the street from the hotel. We cant wait to come back to Seattle for another Seahawk/Mariner game. We will definitely stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square. John Phillips<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR11326617">The hotel is not terrible in itself, but the looming and noisy I-5 viaduct is nearby. Also, the King Co. courthouse is not far, and there are a lot of people who hang out around there and around this whole area who are not the greatest. There are some nice tourist destinations near this hotel, but you're much better off staying nearer the convention center and only visiting the Pioneer Square area in daylight if there are specific things there you want to see. Near the convention center puts you closer to other places in the downtown area like the Pike St. Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10697853">My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this small, and historic hotel before our South Pacific cruise. Every thing was fine for us, excellent quality-price: - walking distance to most of the best attractions such as Pioneer Square (historical square, but a bit spooky day &amp; night), Pike Place Market (so lively, we met Rachel, the pig, and many many other Rachel all over the center... cute!), the Waterfront, the Business District, etc. - free bus to the other main attractions - free wireless Internet in our room (we highly appreciated!) - very courteous, and helpful personnel - free &amp; light breakfast, very practical. The room was comfortable, big enough for 2 persons, tastefully decorated but not well organized (nice but too big furniture), especially the bathroom as someone else mentioned. Before checking at the hotel, we visited the University District, which is far from the center but worthwhile to visit by car (we came from Vancouver with a rented car - a 3 h drive). Immediately after checking (our room was not ready), we returned our car. The rented car office was, again, within walking distance from the hotel. We were glad to have done that because although the Hotel offers parking spaces, they were far from the hotel, and expensive, and we do not need a car to visit Seattle. Public transport seems very well organized at least during the week. Seattle is a pleasant city, easy to visit; people were really nice and helpful with us, tourists (as in Vancouver by the way). Terminal 30, where our ship, Sun Princess, docked was close (a short taxi drive), not far from the stadium. But do not think about walking there: it seems to me a labyrinth of highways... I would certainly return to this hotel, and recommend it, if it is less expensive than big hotels nearby, which in our case were anyway all full.<topic>none</topic>

Your rooms are very nicely decorated and extremely comfortable. We traveled with Russ and Rosemarie Regn. Thank you for also including us a bottle of champagne and basket of goodies. They shared their bottle with us the first night. We shared ours with them the second night. Thank you for your hospitality. The extra courtesy you extended to us as well made our stay very memorable. It was a pleasure meeting you. There is so much to see and do in Seattle. Much more than I was aware of.

<comment category="positive" id="UR8607866">My husband and I spent a week in Seattle, basically did a sightseeing/pub crawl tour of the city. This hotel is the only one in Pioneer Square, and it is within walking distance of everything. In fact, it's across the street from the waterfront, which is a popular place to go walking and sightseeing. We never rented a car or taxi; didn't need one. Granted, we walked about 3-5 miles a day, but stopped anywhere we wanted along the way. You don't need a car in the city, and you have to call for taxis anyway...why not walk? The room was always clean, and a decent size for the two of us. It had a weird smell though, but it wasn't something we couldn't tolerate, though. It is very charming and cozy, and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars. In fact, out of all the meals we ate, the restaurant next door, Al Boccalino's, was the best. They provide room service for the hotel, and they have some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Somewhat pricey, but it was SO good. Hotel staff were friendly, but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions I asked (such as, can they help with reservations for the Victoria Clipper, what bus # do we take to go to Ballard, etc.). But, they were very nice and always tried to help. The hotel was quiet when we were there, even though it seemed to be very crowded. I would recommend it to anyone. With our AAA membership, we paid $161 a night, except for Friday night, which was more expensive.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7626327">We stayed at this Hotel while in Seattle on Business. Check in was very complicated they had no parking available when we arrived and the front desk staff was not helpful at all with the parking situation. Our company was paying for the stay but when we arrived we had to wait 45 minutes for someone in the office to figure out what was going on. When we arrived in our room we were plesantly surprised it was large very clean and comfortable. The wireless internet left a lot to be desired very slow and constant drop offs. In the evening the noise from the freeway nearby was constant.. For the money that this establishment cost we could have stayed in a Sheraton or Hilton and been a lot happier<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7419517">Not your normal Best Western, this is a charming hotel in a great location. High ceilings and warm appointments, room quality is excellent and spacious, particularly considering the architectural restrictions of an older building. Use the tiny elevators, or what the heck... climb the wide staircases... it's good for your heart. Step outside into the fun of day or night life in Seattle. You are one block from the waterfront and trolley, and one block from tons of buses. On the opposite end of town from the Space Needle, there are loads of stores, shops and eateries nearby. Bring comfy walking shoes. Down an alley next to the hotel, i.e., one block directly behind the hotel is a wonderful diner, complete with quaint vinyl booths, where you can get a tasty, filling and affordable breakfast. Get a good rate, and this hotel is a sure winner.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7375345">Stayed at this place because I had a business meeting in downtown Seattle. This hotel is right in Downtown seattle but is in the Pioneer square area. To me, this area was pretty bad and I would walk around there alone (I am a woman). I would not feel safe there. Anyway, the hotel is pretty nice and the customer service is first rate. The room was very large but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Great pillows but my body ached from sleeping in the very hard bed. The shower was the best part! Big and plenty of hot water!! I loved that part! Luckily I didn't have to pay for the room but it was pretty expensive - not worth the money to me. And, parking is a mess there - you have to park about 2 blocks away in this parking garage that is not run by the hotel. It is very inconveinant.....<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6907647">This hotel is great if you are looking for a nice, boutique-ish hotel in downtown Seattle, as long as you don't mind the "culture" of Pioneer Square. There are definitely better hotels, but this is just a few blocks from the two stadiums and in the middle of a district with great shopping. Pioneer Square does have a bit of a homeless problem, but I've never seen that spill into the hotel. The rooms as fairly small, but nicely appointed. Free breakfast is okay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6121777">We had a nice stay in Seattle for two days in this hotel, until the moment we were checking out. We had noticed what appeared to be vagrants sitting in the unattended lobby a couple of times, including the early morning were checking out. My wife left our bags for a moment to get a muffin at the continental breakfast and when she came back to the bags, her handbag was gone, and so was the fellow who was sitting across from her. I was at the counter checking out and didn't see anything, but I did see the suspicious fellow sitting in the lobby as I move our bags. The manager was not there, as it was a Sunday, and they have treated us like we're trying to pull a scam. They claim no liability for baggage untended, but they should at least take responsibility for making sure their lobby is clear of derelicts waiting to prey on their customers. From about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. there is supposed to be someone at the front door, but outside those hours they have nobody there, and the clerks are unable to see who is coming in or leaving. The manager says they have security cameras, but I think she was bluffing to see if I backed off of our claims. None of the other employees there that morning knew of any cameras. Furthermore, the manager NEVER returned any of my calls as promised. We feel we've been treated disrespectfully, and none of our suggestions have been taken seriously (ie the need for full-time front-door concierge/security). That part of Seattle has really become full of vagrants. BEWARE!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5767903">We stayed here in late August. This hotel is a decent stay for a decent price for this time of year. The service is awesome. They would clean our room in the morning and again in the late afternoon with candy on the pillow. It is in such a historic area and right across the street from Pier, underground tour and waterfront walk. The area is in a positive transistion for such an older area of town. Lots to see and do and easy to catch the bus to other areas of town. Hotel is totally redone and refurbished with great service. If you don't care about having a room with a view, much cheaper rates. It is however in the older area of town and the panhandlers are everywhere. Panhandlers are quite polite, but aggresive.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126072311">My husband, dog(Shelby), and I have stayed at this Hotel Monaco twice and the one in Portland once. We joined their Kimpton Hotel loyalty plan and have been treated like treasured guests ever since. Their stated goal is to be the "most loved" hotel company and they have certainly endeared themselves to us. On this trip their dedication to top-notch customer service was evident even before we arrived. We were staying downtown to celebrate my husband's birthday. I had reserved an upgraded room online, but then worried later that it might not be one of their dog-friendly rooms. I called to make certain it was all okay and spoke to a really nice woman (wish I'd gotten her name) who assured me that there are dog-friendly rooms of each kind and that our reservation was all in order. She noted that we are members of the Kimpton In-Touch program and that we were going to be there for a special occasion. She asked if we would like to have a bottle of wine or champagne in the room. I stammered a bit and said that actually we are micro-brewed beer hounds. She said she would see what she could do. So, we arrived downtown around 1pm and thought we'd see if they would let us leave our car there while we went to eat lunch and wait for our room to be ready. We were delighted to find out that our room was already available and we could unload the car. The valet was very sweet to our dog and helped us juggle the luggage, dog, jackets, keys, etc. Inside they have an adorable chalkboard with the names of all the dog guests posted. They also give you a little gift bag with dog treats, a dog toy, and clean-up bags. The lobby has a lot of seating areas, a fireplace, chess set, and complimentary wine around 5ish. I'm not sure what the decorating scheme would be called, but it's warm and comfortable as opposed to a lot of the trendy places with hard surfaces and mod colors. Our room was decorated in a similar fashion to the lobby and included a sofa, lounge chair and desk with desk chair. There was also a bed on the floor for our dog. The bed for the humans was huge and had crisp linens and lots of pillows. The bathroom was a nice size and instead of those little bottles of shampoo and such they had large dispenser bottles in the shower. Probably better for the environment. After dropping our things we went out to explore the city. The hotel is in a great central location and you can leave your car there and walk all over the place. When we came back a couple of hours later there were three bottles of Pike Place Brewery ales chilling in a bucket of ice. There was also a personalized card written to my husband wishing him a happy 56th birthday. It was signed by the Chief Concierge, Jesse Peterson. Too cool! The next day we had a really delicious brunch at the adjoining restaurant, Sazerac. After we returned home I filled out an online questionnaire and gave them high marks for making us feel so special while we were at the hotel. I then received a 'thank you' email from the Director of Operations and it wasn't a form letter! These people are SERIOUS about customer service. I have recently slacked-off on writing reviews because it's time consuming and I feel a little bit like "why would anyone care what I think", but when a company puts so much time and effort into making sure I'm happy I'm glad to talk about them to anyone who will listen.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125768347">We made last minute reservations (day before) for an overnight in Seattle. The benefits of being a Kimpton In-touch member certainly paid off, we had a decent rate, free parking and a $20 dinning credit. The room was beautiful we love how each room is a bit different and it's not like the "standard" whenever you stay at a Kimpton, unless the standard is "cool"! We had very friendly and helpful service from when we dropped the car off at valet all the way to check out the following morning. When we dropped off the car we mentioned that we'd need a taxi in about 30 mins, as soon as we came back out the valet mentioned that he hadn't been able to get a taxi yet, but that there was a town car available that would take us where we needed to go for the same price as a taxi. Bonus! A very nice gentleman then took us to Queen Anne and it was much more pleasant than a taxi. We just appreciated that on a busy Saturday night the valet actually remembered that we had requested a taxi.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125625830">This was my first stay at a Kimpton hotel, and I have to say I was pleased. We had a very late check in, so I was happy to have a speedy experience at the front desk. We ordered a quick bite with room service, which was a nice to have available so late at night, and it arrived quickly. We had a Monaco King room which was pretty spacious, with a desk area, lots of room, and a really comfortable bed. The only thing I wasnâ€™t really crazy about was our shower had built in dispensers of shampoo and conditioner instead of individual bottles. They do, however, offer a handful of amenities at the front desk such as toothpaste and the like if you forget to pack them (some free, others for a fee). We had an issue with our mini fridge, and not only did they service it right away but they immediately brought a cold drink from the bar downstairs since what we wanted from the fridge wasnâ€™t cold. At every encounter the staff was friendly and efficient. Ask for a goldfish, and your stay is complete! It is centrally located so you can walk to many attractions in the city. Itâ€™s extremely close to Pike Place Market, and you can walk down to the original Nordstrom. They have complimentary coffee in the morning, and I think a cocktail hour in the evenings? We booked the $1 breakfast, which was okay â€“ for $1 itâ€™s a perfectly fine continental breakfast, but donâ€™t expect to be full. Thereâ€™s actually a great little bakery across the street down a block by the Fairmont that I would recommend for excellent pastries like ham and cheese croissant, cinnamon buns, etc. I would stay here again, and will probably seek out their properties in other cities. I also recommend joining their loyalty club for some nice extra perks like free WiFi.<topic>none</topic>

The two person jetted tub is DEEP :0 Lots of cool details throughout the room. No view At ALL tho. We walked in with no reservations and asked to book a Mediterranean King Room. The front desk clerk said they were booked. I told him I had just seen four room categories available on line within the hour. He then said he had found one room available, but couldn't offer AAA or Gov't rate. The rate from the front desk was $45 higher than what I'd just seen on line (with AAA ($186) and also included a $20 dining credit in their outstanding restaurant, Sazerac), so I stepped into the lobby made the reservation and waited for it to show up on their system (that made time for a quick drink anyway.... :) The front desk staff were very pleasant throughout the process and offered to store our bags while we got things arranged.

<comment category="negative" id="UR125111308">My husband stayed here on business quite some time ago, and everything was excellent. This time, we were not as impressed. The service was still excellent. And they have complimentary wine in the lobby for an hour each evening. That was nice! And the location is great -- walking distance to Pike's Market and lots of shopping. One of the first things I noticed when we got to our room was that the upholstered chair next to the bed was in tatters. No kidding. In at least four places it was not just threadbare, but literally torn down to the stuffing. For a hotel of this quality, this is completely unacceptable. Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought. But that was before we added in the cost to valet park. It's posted $36 a night, but with taxes it was about $44/night. So be sure to figure that when you're looking at room rates.<topic>none</topic>

Hotel Monaco is only a couple blocks from the light rail, so from the Seattle Airport it is only $2.75pp. Get off at University. Just a 30 minute ride. Easy. When checking in again the staff was so nice and the room was good size and clean. The only negative is request another blanket for the bed. There is no bed covering. We just like the feel of a heavier blanket. Food at Sazar was good and reasonable. Busy at the bar at night. We really enjoyed our stay at the Monaco. You can walk to everything. Just if you go down to the pier it is a heavy climb back to the hotel, so just get a taxi, it is only $4. OH and the Seattle libary is right across the street.

There were only two downsides: the view from our room, right into another building...and the parking. We own a large pickup truck which was too tall for most standard (6'8) parking garages. Neither the front desk or the doorman could direct us to a lot that would accomodate our truck. It took us an hour to find parking 8 blocks away.

<comment category="positive" id="UR123876255">I stayed at Hotel Monaco while on business. The property was located not to far from my office and close to the downtown shopping area , famous pike place market and restaurants. The staff was very kind and helpful. Room service was fast, the food was hot and good. Also, the restaurant in the hotel is amazing! The rooms are spacious, I had a monte carlo suite (way to big for 1 person) that had a king size bed, flat screen TV, as well as a sitting are with a couch, chair, desk and yet another flat screen! The plush jungle theme robe are an added plus! There was even turn down service in the evening complete with chocolate! Great place if you are visiting the Seattle area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123532200">I must say, the Hotel Monaco struck me as a bit odd. I've never been to a hotel where colorful nature murals adorn vaulted ceilings in the lobby. The whole place feels a bit plastic and out of place. That said, the staff was very helpful and the hotel had some nice amenities that give it a nice touch. If you're looking for a luxury hotel where everything is adorned in gold, this isn't your place. In fact, I'd call it entry-level luxury. Not so much luxury, but comfort, spaciousness, perfect cleanliness, and attentive service. The evening wine tastings are a nice touch. The location is an easy walk to the water, Pike Place, or shopping. The bed was comfortable and the place had all the equipment you'd expect in a hotel like this. Some of the touches, like the alarm clock, felt very chain-like, reminding me of what every Hilton in the world equips it's rooms with. But the Monaco has subtle touches that make it stand out and give you a warm feeling, with a room decor that almost evokes a British tea room. Overall, a nice hotel, nothing outrageous, but the value proposition was very good as my girlfriend and I celebrated our birthdays in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123513491">We were greeted by the most friendly receptionist I have ever encountered. She was very helpful and efficient. Our kids loved the pet goldfish in our room. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The restaurant was great too and we looked forward to our breakfast every morning. The location is handy to the attractions of Seattle. We took the bus to Museum of Flight without a problem. Pike markets are an easy walk from hotel. The only downside is the walls are a bit thin and we could here a barking dog on occasion - coming from Australia we are not used to dogs in hotels. I would stay here again. Almost forgot my husband and I enjoyed the complimentary wine at the end of the day.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123305340">Over the New Year's holiday, we enjoyed our first two-night stay at the Hotel Monaco. We frequently travel in North America and Europe and often to Seattle but had never stayed there. They pay attention to the guest in so many ways: examples: the personal email reservation confirmation, genuine care, pleasant conversation and excellent service from all: front desk staff, room service staff, cleaning staff, managers, and especially the valets - we forget the importance of that first encounter with a hotel - the parking valets!- and follow-up personal response to us following our completion of their service survey. This, in addition to a very competitive nightly rate, a very, very clean and comfortable room, great food, the 5-6 complimentary wine service for guests, and, oh, those comfy robes! Monaco is now 'our' hotel in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR123026392">My ho-hum experience here started with the chilly reception we received from the night clerk. You know the kind--they look you up and down, decide you are not worthy, and act like checking you in is a big favor. Normally, I could care less, but we'd just arrived from a long train journey, it was dark and rainy out, we had our discombobulated 7-year-old in tow, and could have used some 'hail fellow well met' at that moment. Publicity boasts about catering to the young uns, but I had to search the website the next day to see what was available for him, and then ask, which put the morning staff in a flutter, because the person who checked us in--I'm looking at you, chilly night check-in guy--should have taken care of it. A much heralded gold fish was brought to our room, which then died. Okay, it happens, it is a living thing, but when we called to have it removed--more 7-year-old discombobulation--we were cheerfully told to put it outside the door, and chirpily asked if we'd like another. I know it's just a fish, but the attitude seemed rather cavalier, especially with a child involved. Yes, they have coffee and tea, but 2 days in a row I had to tell them they'd run out of hot water, breakfast tea, and milk. Don't count on it if you are off to business meetings in the morning as I was. And then there is the nickle and diming that I just can't stand when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel room--one-ply toilet tissue, big bottles of shampoo and soap bolted to the wall, slippers with a "if-you-use-these-we'll-charge-you-$15" tag attached to them. I moved to the Fairmont, got my slippers for free, had beautiful toiletries and was treated to super-friendly service at every juncture. Quirky can carry you only so far--it shouldn't come at the expense, literally and figuratively, of a comfortable stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122847789">The Monaco is slightly quirky as is the case with many of the hotels in the Kimpton group - but it's good quirky! If you're looking for a hotel that has bags of character and doesn't feel like a generic beige property trying to be a boutique hotel, then this is the hotel for you. There are many nice touches: you can request a goldfish for your room if you like, you can get free coffee &amp; tea in the lobby in the mornings and free wine in the lobby between 5pm-6pm. It's the decor that strikes you most.... lots of patterns that clash such as bold stripey wallpaper with patterned carpets, leopard print &amp; zebra print bathrobes. The restaurant serves a pretty good breakfast and locationwise, it's great too. It's on 4th Avenue right opposite the W hotel, there's a convenience store round the corner on University St and it's only about a 4 or 5 block walk downtown to the stores. There are plenty of restaurants nearby too and it's a short walk down to the waterfront.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122768446">On a recent business trip to Seattle I encountered one of the worst "hotel" experiences. Not only did I get food poisoning from eating breakfast at the Sazerac restaurant (restaurant at Hotel Monaco) but I had to extend my stay an extra day (cause I was so sick) and the hotel didn't even comp the extra night ($140) or the cost to change my airfare. In addition, I had to take "personal time" from workâ€¦.WHAT A WASTED 8 HOURS. THANKS!!! I had colleagues stay at the "W" (across the street from the Monaco).

<comment category="positive" id="UR122594964">A truly beautiful hotel with the appointments that make it uniquely Kimpton. The Monaco Seattle was fantastic in every sense. The location provided for superior ease - whether to go down to the water, Pike's Place Market or walking distance to great restaurants and bars - perfect after business meetings for dining and exercise. Nearby shopping looked exellent but this was a business trip so I made note for future trips. While so close to many things, the doorman was fantastic and quick to offer assistance in providing car service to the airport upon our departure. The room was spacious and left no detail needed. Warm, soft sheets &amp; covers and a superbly comfortable bed in a very clean room. The suite has plenty of room for two and was quite large for one. A nice set-up for working allowed me to conduct business and spread out. Plush towels and robes with a nicely done bathroom topped it off. The complimentary morning coffee and hot chocolate bar in the lobby was fantastic in the morning as was the wine in the evening. While we missed dining in the restaurant it looked divine and my travel colleague had been several times and sang its praises. The decor was gorgeous - and it completely lent itself to the holiday decorating that was classy and not ostentatious. Service was good and the business center had brand new Mac desktops; I had visited to print our boarding passes. I also poked around on the lower floor and would recommend this hotel for business / corporate meetings as well. A nice surprise after arriving home - the manager followed up with personal email. Kimpton does it right and the Monaco Seattle underlined it yet again. While they have two other hotels in the area that I have heard are great, I will defiitely return to the Monaco as it felt comfortable and elegant - and I felt appreciated as a guest.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122196065">We were attending Teatro ZinZanni in Seattle, to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary, and looking for a nice hotel downtown to make the most of our visit. The Monaco offered a really great price to theater guests, so we gave it a try. Starting right at curbside, with the charming and helpful valets, we knew we made the right choice. The lobby was magical, with its holiday decor, and the desk clerks were professional yet casual at the same time (really?) We felt special when we used the room key-card to reach our "secure" floor in the elevator, and imagine our surprise to find his and hers jungle print bathrobes (which we immediately donned, snapped photos, and texted them to our grandchildren) and a goldfish we named BART to keep us company. The bed was comfortable, room clean and nicely decorated, everything we had hoped for, but it was "the little things" that made it a perfect fit for us.<topic>none</topic>

And of course, they are (my favorite word) free, during the hotel's nightly cocktail hour. The next morning, in addition to fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee (yes, there's that word again, free), there was a seasonally-inspired supply of hot-chocolate, which I mixed with marshmallows and a heap of other goodies.

<comment category="positive" id="UR121767415">We had a great stay at Hotel Monaco. It was with trepidation that I traveled half way around the world with my nine year old daughter, however when we arrived, having emailed the hotel requesting early check-in, our room was thankfully ready. The check-in was fast and organised. Movie, voucher for my daughter and a mini-bar voucher for me. It is worth joining the Kimpton in-touch program. Best bits:The hotel is perfectly located, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. The beds are comfy, it has nice decor, the cleanliness was fantastic and the pet fish was a nice touch. Finally you can't beat the service, from the door staff, desk staff or restaurant staff, all great. My only word of warning is not to let your kids get to the TV remote first The on- demand is much easier for them to access than the regular programming. I'll end up with a smallish tv bill for on-demand Disney, but I'll put that down to exhaustion and not worry about it.<topic>none</topic>

And is a GREAT location-very close to many attractions downtown Seattle. All were in walking distance. The staff was VERY friendly, and always spoke to us when we were coming and going. The free Starbucks coffee and nightly wine receptions were wonderful. When we asked about transportation back to the airport, they secured a town care for us that was less expensive than a taxi. The only negative I would have to say is that the housekeeping staff woke us up early everyday! The walls are really thin in the rooms. i could hear what my neighbors were saying. The beds were uncomfortable, and the rooms were slightly dated. The DM emailed me after my survey, and ssaid they are going to renovate soon.

<comment category="negative" id="UR120707106">I hated staying here and would never return. I was here for a 8 days but we had hot water for morning showers for only 4 of them. It's a ratty sort of decor that you get tired of looking at very quickly. The location is good but there are other hotels nearby and the worst part is that as you travel from the Monaco to the convention center and other places you stare wistfully at those other hotels wishing you had made the better choice and stayed at them. The only reasonable feature of the Monaco is the staff, all of whom are relentlessly friendly and helpful; for example, they gave us a voucher to soothe the grouchiness caused by cold morning showers. The goldfish deal is a total gimmick and matters not a bit. We didn't take advantage of the afternoon wine. Our room had a view of a concrete wall from street to sky - in other words, we could see nothing. The bed was uncomfortable and there were strange noises in the room, the source of which I could never figure out. Lots of nice hotels in Seattle but this is not one of them.<topic>none</topic>

As you enter the room, you first notice the salmon pink stripe wallpaper. The blue headboard with blue vases on the wall, and even the desk chair has a blue back to match...equal fun decor. I also enjoyed the complimentary wine happy hour between 5 and 6 pm. It was a nice opportunity for me to test a WA cabernet. The complimentary coffee and tea in the morning is nice plus as well.

The location is ideal, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, downtown shopping and Pioneer Square. The decor in the room was different from the standard hotel, a nice change. We thought the chocolates on the bed every evening was a nice touch. A few complaints: The animal print robes felt kind of grubby, and the doors slammed when people left their rooms.

<comment category="positive" id="UR120128884">We used the Hotel Monaco as home base for our recent wedding in Seattle. We chose the Monaco because it is very personal: they go our of their way to make you feel welcome, from the guys who greet you at the front door, to the complimentary coffee in the morning and wine in the evening, to the goldfish they will give you for your room if you ask. We wanted our guests to have the same welcoming feeling, since many of them were traveling in from out of town and hadn't visited Seattle previously. During our visit the staff was very friendly and accommodating, understanding some of our weird requests (for example, we asked that our guests' goldfish be named "Cupid") and helping us out when we were in a pinch (a tux was left in a taxi trunk and the hotel recovered it for us.) The cost we worked out for the group rate was a little higher than nearby chain hotels, but we feel it was very much worth it. The Monaco will be our go-to hotel for all our visits to Seattle in the future, and we suspect it will be for our guests as well.<topic>none</topic>

They have a wine hour which is great, aside from the fact that the only wine they have is Barefoot. That surpises me for a 4 star hotel. I enjoy good wine, and can also drink not-so-good wine, just not Barefoot. It's horrible. I couldn't drink it, so had champagne instead which was great. And since our group was the only one drinking it, by the end of the hour we were given the bottle to finish. That was a nice touch. Hotel is clean and charming with it's boutique decor.

Had room service both days, and they accepted small modifications I requested to the standard menu without batting an eye. Desk service and concierge service was great and very helpful. This is a great hotel for the business traveler - makes it easy to work and to relax. I'll definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119603607">The rooms were quite spacious and comfortable and the lobby was old fashioned and lovely. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. On the down side the lighting over the sink in the bathroom was very dim as was the lighting in the room in general. I overheard guests making jokes about the very dark elevators and the hotel trying to save a little money. Housekeeping was sloppy. Had to call twice for supplies. The location is really perfect. Can walk to the Library or Pikes Market easily. Do not try to eat dinner in their restaurant before 8:00 P.M. It's a real "happy hour" hangout and extremely noisy. The other Kimpton Hotel a block away has a very nice Italian restaurant with extremely good food. Would recommend that highly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119567433">We just returned from a weekend stay at the Hotel Monaco. Over the years on our bi-annual trips to Seattle, we've stayed at a variety of hotels and this hotel is our favorite by far. Strongest points: a fun and pleasing decor with lots of verve and flair in the lobby and guest rooms, a pleasant and helpful staff and cosy, non-generic rooms that make you feel at home immediately. Also the room rate was very reasonable. The size of the hotel is perfect if you're seeking a more intimate feel than the quality chain hotels in Seattle provide. Both the hotel and its attached restaurant Sazerac have real character and zazzâ€¦..more so than many of the high-end traditional style hotels in Seattle. We loved the nightly wine hour in the lobby and at Sazerac enjoyed a good breakfast and a couple of terrific happy hours (This bar is rated as offering one of the top 20 happy hours in Seattle and if you've never been to Seattle ---happy hours are big-time here for both drink and food.) We requested a higher floor room and were really appreciative when the hotel staff actually did follow through and give us a lovely, quiet room on the 9th floor. The hotel is well-situated. We came in on 'The Link' from the airport and the hotel is only 2 blocks away from the University stop. (note: If you're planning to take the Link into the city from SEATAC airport be prepared for an extremely long walk with your luggage from the Airport terminals to the train. And there's no transport at the airport to the Link.) The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, shops, movie theaters, and an easy walk to many sites including the Seattle Art Museum and Pike's Market. We're definitely planning to make this our destination hotel for future trips to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119487927">I like staying at Kimpton Hotels, for their coffee/wine service, robes, and free wifi. The location of the Monaco in downtown Seattle is great. I walked to Pike Place Public Market in 10 minutes with the sublime Sweet Iron waffle shop one block away. Also nearby is the swanky Purple CafÃ© and Wine Bar. The light rail is a short few blocks as well. First impressions were a mixed bag. We arrived around 2:00 p.m. and our room was not ready, so the women checking us in told us the bell boy would take our bags, but that didn't happen promptly. We must have stood around for 20 minutes and had to find the bell boy ourselves. Once our room was ready we got keys and access to the express elevator, which only services floors 10-11. The keys did not work on the first try so I had to get another set. Room 1017 was smaller than we expected and the bed a lot firmer, but still comfortable with nice views of downtown. There was an off musty smell in the room, as in the robes, which have seen better days. The bathroom amenities could be nicer. The wine hour was packed with nowhere to sit. Overall, an acceptable stay, but will look elsewhere for my next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

I had arranged for an airport pickup through the hotel valet but no car arrived. It was easy to take a taxi ($38) and cheaper than the hotel car service would have been. The staff was apologetic and offered a ride back to the airport which I did take advantage of for my return. Other than that, the visit was flawless. Rooms were clean and comfortable, staff was helpful and friendly, food was good. I was celebrating a birthday while there and that was acknowledged with a bottle of champagne which my friends and I enjoyed. Oh, and the goldfish was a nice touch!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118676090">Was there for 5 days on vacation with a 2 year old and the staff was just Fantastic. Room was great, valet was super helpful and always made sure we knew where we were going. Bar and restaurant let us take drinks and utensils back to our room when we had to accommodate baby's schedule. The front desk gave our daughter a stuffed animal on check-in and put a goldfish in our room, which just made the stay for our 2 year old. Concierge managed to find someone to dry-clean my jacket for a wedding on a friday afternoon when I needed it by sat. afternoon and then handled everything for me. And the absolute highlight for us was seeing our toddler after her bath in her kid sized animal print robe! too cute. Traveling with toddlers can be a challenge and you often spend more time in the hotel than maybe your thought you would.

Most importantly, to me, was that we could walk everywhere we wanted to be - SAM, Pike Market, Pine Street and Safeco Field. My wife forgot her cell phone charger at home and the front desk staff offered to charge it for her - so thoughtful.

The restaurant was great-we had booked a room with a continental breakfast (croissant, juice and coffee) but were able to get cereal, french toast, eggs etc. for an additional fee. The exercise room and Internet were free of charge. I asked for cups of hot water in the evening and they brought it up to our room within 15 minutes. The front desk staff was very helpful. Four newspapers were available in the lobby for free: The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The New York Times, and a Seattle newspaper. The location was great.

<comment category="positive" id="UR118004097">We have stayed in Kimpton Hotels before and the personal, friendly service is consistent regardless of location. The Seattle Monaco was no different. Seattle hotels can be quite expensive in the summer, but the Monaco, while not cheap, was affordable and very well located. We had the entire family with us, so we needed a suite and two rooms. We were all located together, a great convenience. We only used room service once for coffee. The cost of room service everywhere is absurdly high these days. I cannot say it was great value, but it was delivered promptly. Service in the bar downstairs was very hospitable and the evening refreshments were welcome. Finally, the bell staff were great at getting our rather large group in as few taxis as possible and this on a weekend where taxis were at a premium.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117767609">We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 nights in August. The location is good. It is walking distance to Pike Place market and the monorail and there are a few good restaurants nearby. It does get a little quiet on the weekends however as it is in the financial district and we found that most places did close early making it a little diffucult to get a snack or coffee outside the hotel in the late evening. The room was very spacious making it great for us: a couple and two young children. That said, the sofa bed would have been extremely uncomfortable for an adult, but the kids did not complain at all. And it was nice to have a heavy curtain separating the space, so we could have a light on while the kids were sleeping. The welcome package for the kids was nice as was the box of toys in the lobby. We did not get a goldfish for the first few days (due to some heat wave... not sure if that was just a cute excuse for the kids or the truth) but did finally get one after a few days of nagging. Not a big deal, but I would rather they didn't advertise it unless it can be guaranteed upon arrival. The restaurant was great: we ate there twice and had two great meals.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117753244">The staff at the Hotel Monaco from the front desk, to the waiters in the fabulous restaurant each morning to the housecleaning were incredibly kind and helpful. The hotel is located in a great location close enough to walk along the water and close enough to walk to the convention center. It is also safe at night, which I appreciated. I love all animals and adore the "idea" of having gold fish for guests, but for a slightly extra investment for a larger bowl, two fish could hang together. It is difficult enough for fish without pumped in air supply, but to be completely alone (especially gold fish which can easily live together) at least doesn't make it look so lonely. Two different people I brought to my room commented on how lonely the fish in the hall looked. Otherwise it's a fabulous place!<topic>none</topic>

The best part was the staff. They were excellent in all respects - well trained, knowledgeable and helpful. Room 501 was large and comfortable, although it had a "view" of the building across the alley. Air conditioning was a bit weak, but that was fixed by having a fan sent up.

Conveniently located to practically everything, we were able to walk everywhere, including the Amtrak station to catch our train. All the employees were friendly and helpful, especially the turn down service woman. Routinely coming to the room after our east coast time zone bodies were past ready for bed, she eagerly gave us plenty of chocolates and left us alone! Get a goldfish delivered to your room, even if you think it's silly. You'll be amazed how attached you can get to a goldfish! The rooms are spacious (we had a king suite and a queen) with plenty of places to sit besides just the bed. The beds are comfortable, clean, and the water pressure in the shower is amazing! I love the full size shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel pump bottles in the shower. Not having to fumble with tiny bottles and caps is nice. We never seemed to be around for the wine reception (so much to do!), but did have breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was very good.

The hotel is a short walk from the Pike St. Market and just a few blocks in the orher direction from the Ferry Terminal. The rooms are clean and spacious and the service is excellent. They have a complimentary wine tasting in the lobby every evening and you can even get a goldfish delivered to your room to keep you company if you like. The Sazarac Restauraunt is located on the first floor. The food and service is decent and they have a nice happy hour with inexpensive appitizers. I would say if you are flying into Seattle don't bother with a rental car. Valet parking at the Monaco is $35 per night. Take a shuttle in from the airport.

The rooms were very small -- almost like a large walk-in closet. The gym downstairs was cramped, as well, with just a couple of cardio machines. They do have an agreement with Gold's Gym where guests can use Gold's during their stay with Hotel Monaco, but be prepared to hike a few blocks down the street. They offer free wi-fi, which is good. They also had a cocktail hour in the lobby at 5 pm at which they serve beer, wine, sangria and other non-alcoholic bevs, in addition to some finger food.<topic>none</topic>

Easy walking distance to the Pike Public Market, shopping, 5th avenue theater etc. The staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and appreciated. When looking for a restaurant to go to one evening we asked at the front desk about a certain place. We were told straight out that the place was not worth the time or our money. They tell it to you straight up. If arriving by air at the SeaTac airport, you can hop on the Light Link Rail and arrive at a station just one block from the hotel. $6.00 instead of $50 for a cab.

The in-hotel restaurant caters more to an adult, hip crowd, rather than being family-friendly, but there are plenty of choices in downtown Seattle, and not enough time to enjoy them all! Wi-fi is available for free for Kimpton In Touch members- free to join, and a daily newspaper and coupon for the mini-bar were included, too. Kimpton seems to really make an effort to cater to all types of travelers- business, family, singles....the effort is appreciated and we'll stay with them again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115463058">I appreciate Kimpton Hotels. They're all a bit quirky (Monaco delivers a gold fish to your room upon request) with very stylized, current decor, activities for guests (an afternoon wine tasting the day of our visit) and a welcoming attitude towards pets. I don't have any pets, but I imagine it's nice for those who do. The service is casual and low profile, responding rapidly to all requests but not going out of their way to offer assistance. My biggest gripe would probably be the pricey and attractive sundries scattered around the room (at checkout my incidentals totaled $173.84). Ooh, I nearly forgot to mention it, but they have leopard and zebra and cheetah print bathrobes that are pretty neat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115329862">Staff was very friendly and professional at check in. Hotel is in a nice downtown location close to light rail stop from airport. Lobby was nice,but not that big. Each night they had a wine happy hour plus each morning there was coffee and papers to start the day. Room was nice ,but decor was dated with different colors that needed change. Bathroom was nice size and very clean. The hotel takes pets which I didn't know and found strange. Overall good place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115139786">My husband and I love this hotel - it is walking distance to both the Market and Safeco Field. The wine social is more like a party in the lobby with games, a fortune teller, a piano player, and all the wine/beer you can drink in an hour. And the staff is always friendly and helpful. This hotel is also pet-friendly with a resident dog that greets you in the lobby. Great place to stay!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115030701">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night after returning from a cruise. The hotel was conveniently located downtown, only a short walk from Pike Place Market. The Space Needle was about a mile walk, and you can take the monorail to shorten the walk. Very friendly, helpful service at the hotel, especially the bellhops. The room was nice and clean. My only complaint was the room doors which were older and noisy when people shut them, which woke me up a few times.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114959473">This hotel is located in downtown and in close proximity to the Public Market (6-8 blocks) and Space Needle (about 20 blocks, cab ride cost $8). Starbucks next door, tons of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. I stayed here for 1 night after a business trip in Redmond. The staff at this hotel were attentive and friendly. I was put on the 11th floor which has an "express elevator" - bypasses floors 1-9. I had a queen bed and the room was quite spacious. The toiletries were from London and smelled sooooo good:). Also, the bed was quite comfortable- I slept like a baby. Hotel is very clean. CON: There is no ice machine on the 11th floor, you have to go down to the 10th. This is no big deal, but could be "nice to have" on the same floor:) I highly recommend this hotel. Next time i'm in Seatte, i'm staying here for sure!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114913605">Wow. What an amazing staff at this hotel. I believe a room is a room and all hotels will sell you a room. What makes a big difference to me is the service provided to you at the hotel. The Hotel Monaco in Seattle has SUPERB service. Truly. The staff is beyond outstanding. Nothing is too big of a deal for the staff at this hotel. It is easy to say "oh well that's just good customer service - but the staff at this hotel gives EXTRAORDINARY customer service to every individual. Example: during the wine reception the staff not only had wine available, but had fresh sangria and water. The staff not only poured what you wanted, but offered other things e.g., pass around appetizers one night, happy hour suggestions, would make dinner reservations while you were drinking wine, etc. The concierge at this hotel was amazing as well! If you have an issue they take care of it IMMEDIATELY (I had an issue with the restaurant twice and the hotel staff was so nice about trying to fix what had gone wrong). I even had the opportunity to meet the General Manager - Mr. Tom - after meeting and talking with him for a bit it was really obvious to see why the hotel staff was so extraordinary. A room is a room, but if you are visiting Seattle, this hotel makes you want to never leave!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114848995">The hotel is conveniently located near the heart of Seattleâ€™s shopping district. The staff were extremely helpful, with one of the staff at the concierge desk Googling the weather the night before a tour I had booked. The room was extremely comfortable and spacious, and their restaurant was great. Room service food was average, but the staff member who delivered it was very friendly. The hotel also hosted the convention I was there for. The staff handled it amazingly and were very friendly throughout the whole process, even though it must have been pretty stressful to coordinate. The food was also amazing â€“ I am in love with the apple pastries they served for breakfast and wish I could have taken some home. I was travelling on my own but couldnâ€™t help noticing their kid- and pet-friendly policies. Pets are allowed, and their names are written on a blackboard. Kids can also get a goldfish to keep as a pet while theyâ€™re there. The hotel puts a very strong emphasis on friendly, personalised service, and it comes through in everything they do. It is very rare in my experience to find a hotel that has luxury facilities but is down-to-earth in the way they treat their guests. I have been told that the entire hotel chain (Kimpton Hotels) aims to be like this, so I will definitely be checking out other hotels from that chain the next time I go to the US.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114834062">Went to Seattle for the weekend and stayed at Hotel Monaco. Location was great. Staff very friendly &amp; helpful. Good place to take kids. They had a welcome bag for our little guy upon arrival and a gold fish named "Karen" in our room. He loved it! The hotel decor was great! Very oppulent. We stayed in the Monte Carlo suite. It was spacious and comfortable. We chose the suite so that we could relax without disturbing our son once he went to sleep. The two rooms are seperated by a big curtain. It worked. Was not soundproof but baby did not wake up, so it served its purpose. Turn down service in the evening &amp; choclates in the room. On the flip side there were a few things: the hotel plumbing was very noisy. Everytime someone ran water/ flushed a toilet you could hear the pipes in the walls screaming away. the hotel taxes were really high. $50/night on a $340/night room. (included continentail breakfast with this price. Breakfast was good. But quite small (coffee, oj &amp; croissant) Lack of hot water when showering. I had a bath 1 night &amp; a shower another time. Both times I was only able to have a luke warm temperature. Not the case for my husbands showers. They were hot. Perhpas it was bad timing, but that isn't something I expect from a hotel as usually the hot water is limitless. Overall, I would stay again at this hotel. The negatives were minor and the plus' were great!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114812558">Our 25th anniversary fell on the date of a meeting I couldn't miss - so my husband came with me. I'd just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Salt Lake and loved it, so I changed my reservation to try out the Seattle location. We had a wonderful time. The staff was amazingly helpful from the minute we drove up. The bellman helped us with all of my workshop materials - and then filled our ice bucket. The window seat was actually a comfortable place to sit and relax while enjoying the champagne and fruit tray they'd left for us. The location is close to everything - we parked the car and walked everywhere. Breakfast in the restaurant was quick, healthy, and good. The wine reception each evening is yummy. Join the rewards club and internet is free, and you get a coupon for the mini bar. The overall ambiance of the hotel is warm and comfortable. It's a place to linger and relax.

<comment category="positive" id="UR114588819">My colleague and I stayed in two separate rooms at the Monaco, and even though we both reserved Monaco Queen rooms, hers--on the 3rd floor--was cramped and got a fair amount of street noise, while mine--on the 10th floor, a VIP floor--was very spacious and peaceful, with a nice view. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, with excellent amenities. Front desk, bell, and housekeeping staff were all courteous and helpful, although the person checking me in forgot to tell me about hotel amenities like the evening wine reception and Kimpton InTouch amenities like free wi-fi. We had breakfast each morning at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac, because our room rates included continental breakfast. The food was quite good but service was slow most mornings. The hotel is reasonably close to both the Convention Center, where our conference was held, and Pike Place Market, where we liked to go in our spare time. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. The rooms were not remarkable, but the gracious service was definitely above the norm.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR111197738">I have had the pleasure of staying at this Kimpton property many times over the past several years as I often travel to Seattle on business. I am always impressed with the staff - friendly faces, willingness to help under any circumstances - to be quite honest, the people are what keep me coming back. During my most recent stay here's a sample of what I experienced. As a member of the InTouch program, upon check-in I was assured that all of my preferences had been taken care of (extra towels, the Wall St. Journal each morning) but also received a gift certificate for $20 off any refreshments in my room, just for being a return guest! Within about 10 minutes of getting settled in my room, the phone rang. The front desk was just checking in to make sure that my room was comfortable and to offer any further assistance personally if I might need something. Perhaps one of the best moments was for nightly turn down service. When I opened the door, I was greeted with the most genuine smile I've seen in any of my travels. She offered me the complimentary chocolates, even some extra ones, and then said, "Enjoy your evening my sweet sister." From the "Welcome back" each night from the bell staff, to the kindness of the housekeeping staff, it's the little touches that make the Monaco one of my favorite places in Seattle to stay. I'm a sucker for a comfortable bed and soft sheets but it's the service that makes it a pleasure to be a guest of this hotel. I refer many of my colleagues and will continue to do so, all because I feel that the folks of this hotel truly appreciate my business.<topic>none</topic>

Room was comfortable, clean and very quiet. Check-in person was very friendly and courteous. Complementary wine hour was an unexpected bonus. After answering the hotel's e-mail survey (post departure), I made a minor comment and was surprised to receive a personal reply from the regional director of operations. Says a lot.....so I will return to the Hotel Monaco again. We live 2 hrs from Seattle and spend the night there at least once per month. By far, one of my favorite experiences to date.<topic>none</topic>

The staff was wonderful the property very clean and centrally located (six blocks from the market). It was easy to get to. The rooms were spacious (double queen) and clean. My only complaint is there was no coffee in the room. Not even a little four cup coffee maker.. I mean this is Seattle, home to Starbucks and other coffee brands? Coffee goes hand and hand with a stay in a hotel. In Seattle I would expect the micro brews of coffees to be sampled in the room, like Portland does with beer. Of course I didn't look until 0'dark thirty.. Other than that it was a great stay and a great property.

Several months later, I was told this was a room no show charge. Hard to believe we'd no show for ONE night during our prepaid FOUR night stay. We are still fighting with the hotel. This has really left a bad taste in our mouths for this place which we were dying to get back to.

It was our 25th anniversary and we wanted to spend a few days in Seattle before our cruise left for Alaska. A trip we have dreamed about for 25 years. I booked the hotel through Priceline and got a really good rate. Once I saw that it was a Kimpton Hotel I went online and joined the Kimpton Frequent Traveler club. I let them know that it was a special occassion for us. They automatically upgraded our room and have Champagne and a fruit basket delivered upon our arrival. It was magical. I have traveled a lot for business, but have never experienced a hotel where every single staff person was so hospitable. I don't know how they do it. They are very welcoming. The bathroom was honestly the cleanest I have ever seen. And, the staff were flawless. We were within walking distance to everything in the city, including the Pkie Place Market. Lots of fun. Make sure to visit the Pier 55 and have a stroll along the waterfront. I would definately stay there again, and I will certainly look for a Kimpton Hotel for my next trip.<topic>none</topic>

I am always impressed when all parts of a hotel are interesting, fun, clean and the people are happy to have you stay with them.

<comment category="positive" id="UR105494945">I'm relocating to Seattle and am currently looking for apartments. While I was looking for a place to live, I chanced across Hotel Monaco and took up residence there for eight days. From the moment I was met at the valet on the first day to the day they handed the keys back to me, I enjoyed every aspect of the stay. Every member of the staff made me feel not only like a valued customer but that they genuinely cared about my comfort. I have stayed in many fine hotels in the past and have experienced great customer service but not really at this level. Upon check-in, I was informed on how best to take advantage of my stay and ways to save money. After having enrolled in their rewards program, they upgraded me to a suite. The room was more than tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The turn down service left two chocolates on the pillow and if I timed it right, they would cut me in a couple more ;-) The restaurant, Sazerac is not a name you will remember but you certainly will remember the experience. The only complaint is that it was so well liked, the place was packed by 5:30pm. Breakfast was just as good as dinner and reasonably priced (as far as breakfasts go for four star hotels). And the relationship was tested as well: Upon check out, I had learned that I had been charged for a bottle of wine I had not consumed. I figured that it was due to a bottle I had brought in and left out on the table. Simple mistake and simply explained. But I did wonder how this would be dealt with. No problem. I explained that I did not drink the bottle of wine and that they were welcome to run inventory and if it was missing they could put it on my tab. No need. They took my word for it and took it off the tab on the spot. Simple thing. Big relief. I've had simpler things ruin a stay. I will be staying there again and highly recommend that if you are in Seattle, you try the Monaco as well.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR104522166">We stayed 3 nights with two children ages 5 and 7. Visiting Seattle for a sightseeing adventure. Hotel is located in the financial district across from the spectacular Seattle Library. It is a quick five minute walk from the Monorail and Pikes Market. The room was clean and quiet. We loved our goldfish and appreciated the kind attitude the staff had toward our kids. The cleaning staff was extremely thoughtful and friendly. The concierge was somewhat condescending and not 100% knowledgeable of the area. We asked if there was a spot to get ice cream and were told, "Seattle is not that kind of city". The next day we stumbled across a gelato shop two blocks away. There are several higher end restaurants, but if you want some mom and pop local flare within walking distance, they cater to the business lunch crowd and close at five. Unfortunately, we won't be returning because the "free internet" you get with the Kipton program did not work. I had a big work deadline and needed to upload a file. The transmit rate was 0. The front desk staff told me to call IT. I spent 30 minutes talking to them with no luck. Finally I packed up and headed to Starbucks next door, but they closed at 6 p.m. Very frustrating and a deal breaker for me.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102814594">We arrived and found they only had us for one night. No problem, they extended it at the same price as the first night. Lobby, elevators, and hallways are very clean and smelled fresh. Elevators are pretty quick and we did not wait more than a minute for one from the 7th floor. Room appeared clean. Beds were comfortable, but pillows were very fluffy and firm. Kind of odd. They brought up two kids bathrobes, which were such a hit. Bathrooms were clean and tub had no mildew. Good water pressure. Phones are a bit dated. You have to push too many buttons to get a service. Quiet, but plumbing pipes are old and can be noisy in the middle of the night. HVAC system was probably the best and quietest I have every seen. Friday night was their 30th anniversary, as was it our Anniversary. They had a two hour wine fest with cupcakes, free snacks, etc. Not stingy on the wine either! Front desk gave us free DVDs to watch. Oh, kids loved the Guitar Hero during out wine social hour. I recommend they do that again. Valet guys were fast and observant of our needs. Parking is high, but along the rates of local parking fees anyway. We just got over it, but it did add to the cost of our vacation. Fun restaurant adjacent to the hotel. Would have been a 5 star, but no pool.<topic>none</topic>

The restaurant was fantastic (but a little pricey) and the decor was really unique. We will make this our regular hotel in Seattle!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR101300691">My wife and I stayed here in March 2011. We enjoyed the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions. We like the free wine tasting. The room was comfortable but a bit small. The staff did an excellent job of accommodating our request for a view. We had a view South down 4th Street. I do not think any rooms have views except of the high rises around the hotel. We ate at Sazerac Restaurant in the Hotel. They had a four course meal for a very reasonable price. We were full by the third course and had the last desert course sent up to our room. The hotel staff and Restaurant staff were very nice about it. My only real criticism was the small fridge was chock full of mini-bar treats and parking costs forty plus dollars per day. We had no room for the delicacies we bought at nearby Pike Market. So I pulled out all the little bottles of Jim Beam and put my stuff in the fridge only to reverse the process at check out. I suspect everyone that stays at the hotel does the same thing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR101249314">Love, love, love hotel Monaco in Seattle. This hotel went above and beyond. We were greeted with a friendly smile and hello. Our room was upgraded to the Monaco Suite due to it being my birthday; and they even sent up a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a birthday card. They have a wine coctail party in the lobby with free wine from 5-6 every evening and a free psychic card reader on W &amp; Sat. evenings. The restaurant in the hotel (Sazarac) is a must try; they have happy hour from 4-8 M-F and great food. The chef here is incredible and a genius with food. The hotel is within walking distance to everything fun in Seattle. Pike place market, space needle, waterfront for ferries and you must stop into Kell's Irish Pub....it's a fvery fun place with live entertainment. Easy access from the airport using the LINK system monorail for $2.50 exit University street. Walk one block and you are at hotel Monoco! Can't wait to come back soon!!<topic>none</topic>

I found this hotel through priceline "name your own price" and it happened to be super value compared to what they offer: pleasant housekeepers, complimentary gold fish through out your stay, wine in the afternoons and chocolate every day :) I supposed to pay more than what I paid (thanks priceline) Do not forget to become Kimpton member, it comes w good benefits. We miss Derrick "Gold Fish" and wish that their prices are more affordable for the budget travelers like I am :/<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR100404167">I got a very reasonable discount rate for this hotel, then showed up several hours early, thinking that an early check in was unlikely, but figuring I'd give it a shot. Not only did they let me check in early, because I had signed up for their "Klimpton In Touch" program to get free internet, they also upgraded my room to a suite! And they gave me a $10 coupon to raid the mini bar. The room was giant, with two flat screen tvs, and really two separate rooms - the bedroom, and another room with a desk and couch(!) separated by a curtain. When I called the desk to ask if it was possible to print out a boarding pass for my return flight, they just asked for my confirmation #, printed the pass out for me, and slid it under my door (so no one was even expecting a tip or anything). The room was great, the staff was friendly and competent as can be, the price was unbeatable, the location (just blocks from Pike Place Market) was perfect, and they even gave me a free newspaper of my choice every night (except Sunday, where only the local paper appears to have been an option -- the one flaw! :-) Just a great overall experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR100382018">We had a most enjoyable stay at the Hotel Monaco, downtown Seattle. Our first, but not certainly last, stay at a Kimpton hotel. The staff (all of them) were friendly, laid back, and very eager to make our stay as relaxing as possible. It's the attitude of the staff that makes the difference, and we certainly noticed that it carried through to everyone working there. I stay in hotels over 100 nights a year throughout the US and can say this has been my best experience. If you want accommodating caring people to help you, this is the place. The hotel is excellent, the food was great with a lot of variety, the little touches (pet friendly, goldfish on every floor, the decor) added to the stay. The great location allows you to walk to many quality restaurants, Pike Place Market and waterfront. Go, stay, and enjoy.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR99415625">This hotel is one of the best places I have stayed at in all my years of travel! Anytime I am in Seattle, I stay here. The staff is amazing and very helpful! At my last stay, as I was waiting for the valet to bring my car around, a man (I'm assuming homeless) tried to walk in the doors and the doorman/valet very calmly and quietly informed him that they did not have a public bathroom and to move along. I was so impressed with his profesionalism and attention to this. I once stayed in a Hilton Hotel in Washington DC and you had to dodge and miss the "bums" who stood inside the lobby of the hotel asking for money. I had my young daughter with me and it was a bit scary for her. So big kuddos to the Hotel Monaco for paying attention to this small but important detail. If I had to say one non positive thing about the hotel is the parking. They do have valets, how are wonderful, but sometimes if I want to get my car and just run somewhere quick, I always feel kinda guilty having to get my car out for a short trip. Never have they complained or made any kind of fuss about it, just me feeling bad for it. HOWEVER, not having to find parking in downtown Seattle is a HUGE plus!!<topic>none</topic>

It's right across from the Seattle Public Library and close to Pike Place Market and everything you'd want to see. The staff was amazing. I asked for an early check in because I needed to work, and they were super accommodating - upgrading me to a suite and getting me into a room immediately. The room was kept meticulously clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Can't say enough about this gorgeous hotel and great staff. Highly recommended.

<comment category="positive" id="UR97601906">My girlfriend and I decided to surprise our 11-year-old daughter with a trip to Seattle for her birthday this last weekend. She had never been and we knew she would love it. I actually went on a hotel discount site and was given this hotel. I had been in the Portland location once and remember it being beautiful and have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and had great experiences. After receiving notice of our reservation I emailed their staff and informed them this trip was for a birthday and requested a room with 2 beds, hopefully towards the top. The assistant manager promptly replied and said that he could accommodate that request but the 2-bed options were lower and didn't have the best views. He then offered to upgrade us for $40 to one of the suites on the top floor. Given that we got such a good deal on the hotel price it was a no-brainer. The suite was excellent with a king bed in the bedroom and a pullout queen sleeper sofa in the living area. Both rooms had their own TV's and there was a curtain that could be drawn to separate the two areas. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was nice but wasn't as lavish as some other 4-star hotels we've been to. All of the soaps and shampoos though were high-end and there was nothing lacking. That night the hotel staff also left a note in our room with a birthday card for our daughter which included a free in-room movie rental as well as an invitation to call down for a complimentary birthday cake. We called down and they brought up a delicious personal-sized chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle in it. She was very excited! Throughout our 2-night stay the staff continued to be amazing. We spent a lot of our time checking out Seattle attractions but each time we came back we were greeted warmly. There was a wine tasting each night in the lobby and the staff always offered to get my daughter a soft drink from the restaurant. There were bowls of chocolates around that we all enjoyed as well. If I had anything to add to the "con" side it would be that the views from this hotel aren't as attractive as some others I've stayed at in Seattle. It's only an 11-story building and there are taller buildings surrounding it. If you're expecting a full city view or one of the water you may be disappointed. We also thought the cost of valet parking was a little much, coming to nearly $40 per night with taxes. I am sure this is on-par with other 4-star hotels but is pretty hard to justify. We opted to valet on Friday night but found street parking on Saturday night since parking is free on Sundays. Overall though, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying there. Even with getting our reservation through a third party site we were never treated differently and that says a lot about a place.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR97481899">We made the reservation one day before our planned stay at the Monaco, Seattle, and they told us that the only room available is a room with a king bed.

<comment category="positive" id="UR96827390">My husband and I stayed two nights at this wonderful hotel for his birthday. I booked the rooms for an amazing price ($70/nt) through Priceline. Because of this, I was concerned we may be treated like 2nd class citizens but that was certainly not the case. Prior to arrival, I phoned the front desk and asked about a room upgrade. I expected to be charged for this but to my surprise, the front desk clerk advised me that if I sign up for the hotel's free rewards program, I could get a free room upgrade. So he proceeded to sign me up over the phone and then upgraded our room to a King Suite with jacuzzi tub. It was fabulous! (Thank you Jason!) The room was lovely. The rewards program also included a $10 credit for the "Raid the Mini Bar" program and free wireless internet. I had also asked Jason if he could arrange for a birthday note or something to be left in the room for my husband. Well, he did better than that. In our room we found a bottle of sparkling brut wine and a bag of chocolates. Wow! One of my favourite things about the hotel is their HosPETality Program. Amazing! We weren't charged extra to have our dog. She was welcome throughout the hotel except the restaurant so during the free wine hour in the lobby from 5-6pm, I sat sipping my wine with my dog at my side. You are allowed to leave your pet in your room unattended while you shop or dine, providing the pet is well behaved. Just leave a contact number at the front desk in case of problems. You'll be given a little sign to hang on your doorknob alerting staff to the presence of your animal. If you don't feel comfortable with this, the front desk offers pet sitting on a first come-first serve basis. Your pet can be tethered behind the front desk to hang with the staff for up to 5 hours. First hour is free and then only $5/hour. The staff here were wonderful. One day we arrived back at our room to find a dog dish with our dog's name written on it piled high with dog cookies and a stuffed goldfish toy. :o) The goldfish signifies another program of the hotel. If you are lonely during your stay, just ask for a pet goldfish and one will be delivered to your room in a little fish bowl, complete with name tag. The hotel does have an attached restaurant that seems quite funky but we dined there on a Sunday night which had a limited menu so I can't comment on the food. Parking is valet and quite costly at about $38/night. However, I think that's pretty standard for hotels in that area. There is no pool/spa but there is a small, adequate fitness room. So if you like a nice soak, upgrade to a room with a jacuzzi tub! I was so impressed with this hotel and its staff. They made our weekend perfect!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR96087967">I'm not in the habit of writing online reviews yet I wanted to acknowledge an outstanding experience recently had at Seattle's Hotel Monaco. Typical of the Kimpton brand, the room was attractive, clean, and well-appointed. The bed was comfortable. The serviceâ€”superb, as always. There is a lovely wine and beer reception in the lobby each evening and it was fun to see all the pooches hanging around this dog-friendly establishment. And, even though the hotel is smack in the heart of downtown Seattle, we heard very little street noise from our room. That said, it is smack in the heart of downtown Seattle! Which means easy walking distance (or a quick cab ride away, at most) to many fantastic restaurants and city attractions. None of these things are a surprise when staying at a Kimpton hotel, and I've stayed at several. What was beyond the exceptional ordinary was the attention given to a Kimpton InTouch Rewards Program issue (the hotel's guest loyalty program) I had with one of their properties I usually stay at in Portland. I sent an email to the Hotel Monaco's manager prior to our stay regarding the previous oversights of the Portland property, inquiring if they might give some attention to the matter. Within twenty minutes I received a reply. WOW! They assured me the problem was being researched so that it wouldn't happen again. They were prompt, responsive and made a service recovery on behalf of the other property when it wasn't even "their" issue. Not only that, my beau had garnered this particular reservation via Priceline, so we were already getting a fabulous rate to begin with. When we arrived, there was a bottle of wine, chocolate and a lovely card waiting for us. The valet attendant made our life easier by offering to keep our car parked curbside since we needed to leave soon after our arrival. Our room was upgraded to a suite and and it was fabulous. I'm a longtime hospitality veteran with years in the hotel industry. True customer service seems to be a dying art, and yet Kimpton manages to hire, train and maintain a staff of people who seem to find joy in elevating the quality of a guest's stay. Bravo to you all! It's why I keep coming back and why I refer others to these properties. There are so many places to stay in any city; my loyalty goes to the businesses that show me my comfort and well-being matters... that's *real* service. Many thanks, and see you again soon!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR95345905">I would definitely stay here again. We have stayed at other Kimpton hotels and each experience has been great. The overall vibe of the hotel from the coffee service in the morning to the wine tasting in the evening in the hotel lobby was excellent. We have found their hotels offer a unique experience to other places we have stayed and we travel a lot with our kids. They had goldfish in our room! Our room had 2 queen beds, our girls are 7 and 10 and we never felt crowded or uncomfortable. Great location, close to everything (walking distance).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR95229990">Nice, clean, pet-friendly hotel. But I'm not quite sure what make it "luxury" in nature. The rooms are small, but that's to be expected I suppose in a big city. However, I had a chance to visit a different hotel, a 3 star, in the same area, and the rooms were 2x as big. The rooms were decorated in a very boutique quality, with red/white stripes. The bathrooms were small, and very very plain. Nothing close to some of the luxury hotels I've stayed in in the past. But the hotel was very clean, comfortable, and in walking distance of most of the downtown attractions, which was what I was looking for. For the price I got on Hotwire, it was great. For the regular going luxury hotel price, not so much. Now the hospitality. The hotel staff were very nice for the most part, but I had read so many reviews about how they went above and beyond. This was not the case when I visited. I looked like crap when I arrived at the hotel - after delays at the airport, and 2 layovers, I looked about 15 years old, with terrible bed hair. I got to the hotel in the middle of the day, and the two doorman just looked at me. No "Let me grab the door" or "Let me help you with your luggage." Just looked at me, grunted a "hey, good afternoon" and went back to talking. This ended up being the last time I ever saw a doorman for my entire weekend stay. Got to the front desk, and immediately, the clerk judged either my appearance, or my booking through Hotwire. He mumbled a few things about the hotel, gave me my key, and went back to doing whatever he was doing. A girl at the desk was checking in a different customer, a older, male gentleman, and went through a clear, welcoming explanation of the hotel and amenities, and asked if he was a Klimpton member. He said no, and she explained how he could sign up for free internet. All of which was never even asked, or mentioned to me. I looked back at my clerk and said "Um, Im a member. how do I access the internet?" He suddenly became a lot nicer. From then on, I really didn't bother with the hotel staff. The cleaning crew were very nice and helpful however. They helped me out when I couldn't find my toothpaste and the front desk said "Oh we ran out." uh. huh. The last day I needed a taxi, and told the front desk to call one 10mins before I checked out (Seattle is not known for its cab services...so you really have to call in advance). I walked out...no cab. "Oh we called! He should be here asap" 10mins later, no cab. I asked the front desk to call again, and they said "Oh sure, in a bit" Um. No. I ended up taking a gypsy cab that I hailed myself that cost me 2x as much, but I had a business meeting and I was nearly late. I guess I would recommend it, for the price on hotwire ($90 a night), for the cleanliness, the location, and the cleaning staff. But the hospitality left a lot to be desired.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR95228524">The Hotel Monaco is situated in downtown Seattle within walking distance to 'must see' sites such as Pike Street marketplace, waterfront and shopping. The hotel had valet parking which we used for convenience, but there is plenty of parking garages close by. The hotel staff were pleasantly accommodating when we asked to change one of our rooms from a single king to two beds. We enjoyed the five o'clock wine reception in the lobby before heading out to McRory's. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler anxious for a friendly, elegant...yet not 'stuffy' hotel with incredibly comfortable beds.<topic>none</topic>

Hotel Experience: 3 stars, out of 5 Hotel Class: 3 stars, out of 5 Service: 5 stars, out of 5 Room: #310 (I think it was this room) Pros: - Service: Very courteous, helpful, and friendly Bellhop, House Keeping, and Front Desk - Pets: Pet-friendly hotel - Accessories: Umbrella and Robes for hotel guest use - Location: 5 minute walk to Pikes Place/Shopping Areas, Close to Seattle Art Museam (SAM),15 minute walk to the Tom Douglas Restaurants Cons: - Overall Condition: Run-down room, need of maintenance. - Bathroom: Hole at the shower ceiling, Tile grout needs to be cleaned - Coffee maker: No coffee maker in guest rooms (the Front Desk mentioned the coffee was offered on the Main Floor as I recall). In-room Coffee Maker can be requested, but the one they delivered to the room was worn down and the coffee mug was filthy. We didn't use it. - Furniture: Upholstered furniture with stains, casegood furniture are poorly assembled and sticky from wear, Furniture in general were tired and worn - Bedding/Sheets: Stained sheets and pillow covers first night, second night was fine. Notes: - Parking: Hotel Valet Parking was $40. (It's generally expensive in this area). Street parking available, but watch out for meter times. - Sample Hotel Room Features: Faux-painted finishes and furniture, leopard and animal printed robes, terry cloth shower curtains. - Impression: Good and may be fun for families and guests traveling with pets.

<comment category="positive" id="UR94164111">My wife and I decided to visit Seattle for a quick weekend trip to get away for our 20th anniversary. We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than â€œjust a roomâ€�. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.<topic>none</topic>

The Monaco is unique, offering all of the amenities one expects in a quality hotel, with a relaxed eligance and level of warmth one does not find in a larger facility. Their staff is consistently the most friendly and efficient group of people you could wish. Besides being a great hotel the location is outstanding, withing easy walking distance to the Benaroya Hall and the Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Art Museum, many other Seattle entertainment venues, great shopping and excellent restaurants.

<comment category="negative" id="UR90394115">Valet and bell service were very prompt. Front desk staff were very friendly and nice and provided directions to business locations. Bell service from lobby to room was very quick. We have 2 pets who we often take with us on leisure and business trips. So Kimpton hotels are great for families with pets. Loved that pet beds and dishes were already set up in the room, nice touch. Although, to most travelers rooms are probably just average, but for us pet owners who take our little friends with us it's a nice hotel. Some "Pet Friendly" hotels can be real dumps and Monaco is certainly not one of them. Only down side is being right in downtown Seattle is there are limited grassy potty spots, so that's a bid of a bummer. Also, walls are a little thin and we could hear our neighbors having a good time (wink*wink*) and were pretty vocal about it. Probably could have slept through it but the dogs kept jumping up and off the bed trying to figure out where the noise was coming from or perhaps they thought someone was in need of rescue. Oh well, over all a nice location!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR89371715">...is how we would describe Hotel Monaco. We booked rooms for ourselves and 3 other couples for our annual after Thanksgiving/before Christmas treat in Seattle. We loved the parking, just pull up in front and they whisk your car away, no self parking here, it was great. The hotel is perfectly situated to wonderful restaurants (though the hotel's Sazerac was quite tasty) shopping and the theater. Monacos staff was terrific as usual even sending a bottle of champagne to one of our group that was celebrating her 50th birthday. The hosted wine hour had some delicious selections in addition to spiced cider, soda and a tasty fruit tray. The rooms are large though worn and a bit dated. We did have the annoyance of a dog barking in the wee hours of the morning, I guess that is to be expected in a hotel that accomodates dogs but it is still annoying to be jarred out of sleep in the middle of the night. For the record, each of the four couples that stayed at Hotel Monaco have dogs, we just had the luxury of leaving them at home. Is this a hotel that we would return to? Yes, though next time we'd request a floor well above canine level, hoping there is such a thing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR89203353">I have stayed in other Kimpton hotels and am always extremely pleased with them. This stay was for leisure with my young son and they made each and every one of us feel comfortable and welcome. Kimpton goes out of their way to make their hotel different (the goldfish in your room, the wine hour, the pet friendly environment, the complimentary toy from the toy box for the kids, etc...) but mostly they strive to serve and make you comfortable. Their staff are really friendly and helpful. The lobby is gorgeous and the beautiful books will keep anyone entertained while waiting for others (even a 2 year old!). They had great coffee and tea choices in the lobby and hot cocoa for the afternoon (with mini marshmallows and chocolate chips), which also encouraged lingering! The queen rooms are not huge but are well appointed. The location is excellent - 4 blocks from Westlake Center and 1 block from the train/bus tunnel which makes everything very convenient. The parking is valet and although it seems steep at $36, but was well worth it when you return to your already-packed car during check-out! Plus, they let you leave your car in the garage until 11 PM on the day of check-out, so essentially you can park for 2 full days for the price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR88677264">My partner and I took advantage of a great promotion and got a $289 room for $89 per night. The price was the only thing that was reduced though! The service and thoughtfulness of the staff was way above par. The queen room was on the smaller side, but lovely and clean. The high ceiling (12'?) gave a wonderful feeling of airiness to the room, however. The attention to detail in the decor is wonderful. The robes were thick zebra print terry, perfect for curling up against the down pillows. Another great note was the height and power of the shower. We are both over 6' tall and the shower head was at least 4" above us, plus showered down with a good amount of force. A+++<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR88043355">First impressions: The bellman and the front desk people both immediately demonstrated they were well trained and paying attention to their guests. The front desk lady provided great information (at a pace that was energetic but not rushed), helpful leading questions about the area, and major positive energy without bubbling or being insincere. The bellman was busy with another car when we arrived, but noticed the car in front right away and within a very short period met up with me at the reception desk to get the key from me. We stayed in one of the Monte Carlo suites -- great energizing decor. Comfortable living room area, seperated from bedroom by large drapes, which was great for reading the morning papers or sipping the wine from the lobby before heading out to dinner. The bath had plenty of counter space for both of us (though one sink). The bed was comfortable with a range of pillows, as well as seating arrangements including a nice, comfortable chair and a small, two person bench seat for shoes, dressing, etc. Our maid service did a great job with meticulous neatening up. We also had dinner one night in Sazarac, a New Orleans style restaurant where we encountered more of the same: normal people, working hard, to provide thoughtful, positive service. This included our host, who conscientiously got us a table and our waitress who was busy, friendly, informative and attentive. Monaco is a tremendous location: next door to Starbucks (though there is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings); a block from the Capitol Grill; and easy walking to the retail core. The room was very reasonably priced and we like service, but service at a bargain is even better!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR87724806">Although I work in Seattle and rarely spend money there, I really enjoyed our stay at Monaco Seattle. It all started with knowing our Kimpton rewards gave us a voucher for the in-room mini-bar. Once at the room we were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful fragrance and the fantastic decor. The room (solo King bed) was well laid out and kept very clean. I would, and have, recommended this hotel to many people already and look forward to the next time I spend a night in Seattle. The location was great and I was able to find a better alternative (cost-wise) to the valet parking provided by Monaco.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR87447981">This was our second visit to the georgous Hotel Monaco and we are looking forward to our third! Perfect location for S.A.M., shopping and Pike Place Market. Ten out of ten for WOW factor - just walking through the lobby makes you feel special. Eclectic decor - part art deco, part circus - mainly WOW. Luxurious bedrooms and bathrooms. First class service. Best part is the wine tasting from 5-6pm every night which makes for lots of socialising and intermingling between the guests - makes you feel very welcome and indulged. Morning coffee and tea in the same lounge starts the day off nicely. It's the sort of place you would expect to see Hercule Pirot relaxing in a chair, thinking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR87433912">My husband and I stayed here for a late 1 yr anniversary. It was by far the best hotel we've ever been to. The staff were very friendly and go out of their way to furnish your requests. We stayed in the Mediterranean Suite. They rooms was absolutely beautiful and very spacious. We had massages while there as well. The girls were very professional and easy to talk to. They didn't make us feel uncomfortable at all. It's within walking distance to Pike's Market, so you get to see the city as well on your way there. We got the Harry Potter pkg. At check-in we received our round trip tickets for the monorail and tickets to the Harry Potter exhibition and the Pacific Science Center. There were no hidden costs or fees.

<comment category="positive" id="UR86182235">I picked the Monaco because of the favorable reviews from Trip Advisor and I must say they were right. We celebrated our 42nd anniversary in Seattle with a 4 night stay at the Monaco. From check in to check out our experience was like a home away from home. The Front Desk was very friendly - the concierage, Jesse Peterson went out of his way by sending us a bottle of champagne and giving us a 2 for 1 dinner coupon at one of the area's restaurants. We had already eaten at the Sazarac which was excellent and were looking for a new place to eat. He booked our excursions and gave us advice about the area. We loved the free wine from 5 to 6 and got to mingle with a lot of interesting people. The hotel is in a great location - able to walk to Pike Market and the Mono-rail. The Seattle Library is across the street and an architectural wonder - we did our own tour. We loved Seattle and have now found a good boutique hotel chain that gives great service. I am looking forward to staying at their other hotels. We have four in Chicago - all with great restaurants. Our next stay we will order a gold fish. I also liked the idea of pet friendly even though we don't travel with a pet - it's a good thing.<topic>none</topic>

The staff were attentive and friendly. I find the location convenient to everything from the Pike Place Market to the Qwest and to Safeco ball parks. And this final note: I left an expensive piece of photo equipment in a closet there. After a phone call, the equipment was located, properly packed and shipped to me.

There is a genuine effort being made to make your stay as pleasant and seamless as possible. Outstanding personal service. We like the relaxed feeling of the place, it feels less corporate than other hotels yet maintaining a professional attitude.

<comment category="positive" id="UR84127853">I would highly recommend the Hotel Monaco. I traveled there for business and enjoyed the friendly staff and comfortable room. The shower was amazing - excellent water pressure. I loved walking into the room to find the hotel provided me with a pet - a goldfish named Kevin (requested by my co-worker)! In order to receive free wifi, you must be a Kimpton InTouch member. It's very easy to sign up on the internet. I also received a coupon for $10 worth of mini bar goods. Room service was quick and delicious. My friend traveled with me and was able to check out for me through the television and then stop by the desk to pick up my receipt. She felt her bed was not as comfortable as other hotels (but still quite nice); I had no problem with mine. I only had two complaints: my neighbor waking me up briefly at 4 a.m. and the too soft pillows. Neither would prevent me from staying again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83242480">A friend and I were stranded in Seattle with my two miniature dachshunds and needed a place to stay that not only had a jacuzzi tube in room for us girls but that had a room big enough for the pups to enjoy luxury as well. The Monaco staff was super accommodating and excited to meet the pups. They had a board with all the dogs that were staying in the hotel and a cookie jar full of treats! Our room was the end corner unit so there was plenty of privacy and there was more than enough space for the pups to spread their legs to relax. The room service was extremely delicious. The only negative was that my friend decided to open the $10 razor in the goodie basket before looking at the price! So not really a negative towards the hotel but just a heads up for travelers! The extra plus was getting free wine at the attached restaurant!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR82873575">We stayed at the Monaco during a one night stay in Seattle with our daughter and son-in-law. I booked by calling directly and got a very reasonable AAA rate. The service was impeccable, from the valet who quickly assisted us with our baggage and parked our car, to the doorman who greeted us warmly, to the front desk personnel who efficiently checked us in although we were a bit early. Even more impressive was that later that evening when we arrived back from dinner, we were informed that we had missed the complimentary wine tasting hour and were offered vouchers to go have a glass of wine "on the hotel" in their bar. No hotel has ever done that for us before. The lobby, restaurant/bar, and rooms exuded a warm ambience and the location was perfect, as we easily walked a few blocks to Pike Place Market and a huge selection of restaurants. And even more important, the beds were comfortable! We would definitely seek out a Kimpton hotel again in the future.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81534533">I agree with all the good things reported - great location, friendly staff, good-sized room, etc. however I did think the wine hour was a bit on the tacky side. A glass of wine and not a nut, pretzel or piece of cheese to go with it? For a hotel of this caliber, I think that was surprising. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay, took the light rail from the airport, explored the city on foot and had a great time.<topic>none</topic>

A wonderful and unique perk! The staff is amazing, they have a free wine happy hour everyday from 5 to 6pm. They also brought up a goldfish in a bowl for us to keep us company and my child was in love with it. The rooms are standard but we had a cool big window seat and DVD player. This is our favorite chain for sure and this was out first time at this one. To top it off, my daughter brought her blanket and bunny into the bath with her and the housekeeping manager was nice enough to throw it in the dryer and bring it back to us. Above and beyond! The location is walking distance to some stuff but mostly cabs. You can walk to Pike place though... Stay here for sure!<topic>none</topic>

We had heard about Kimpton Hotels ( smaller european style first class boutique hotels, each with it's own signature restaurant), but never stayed at one. Our entire 3 day experience at the hotel was perfect and made for a very memorable celebration. From check-in, to check-out, the entire staff made us feel special and welcome during our stay, and we loved the happy hour in the restaurant.

Wine hour was a nice way to relax at the end of the day. I turned down the complimentary pet goldfish. Unfortunately I missed the fortune teller and massage.

<comment category="negative" id="UR75638737">My son and I just stayed a week at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle. The location was great; we were able to walk to WNBA, MLS, and MLB games. There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said "well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there's a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall". Then, I didn't get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there's a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there's just a half hearted effort for these "perks". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine. The room was nice; the food in the restaurant was great. We loved our pet fish (Fred).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR72207834">I just got back from a three-day stay at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The bed was very comfortable; the suite was very spacious; the bathroom was very clean. The morning after the first night of my stay, I was sitting at the desk in my room and noticed a very foul odor. ( I had just showered, and all of my clothes were freshly laundered, so it wasn't me.) As I explored, I discovered that the smell was coming from the carpet and the upholstered chairs. One of the chairs had a dark stain on the seat. I don't have anything against pets or pet owners. But I do have a big complaint when a hotel doesn't clean up and disinfect the room adequately after a guest (canine or human) urinates and/or defecates on the carpet or furniture. This was my fifth or sixth stay at this hotel. It will be my last.<topic>none</topic>

The hotel is within walking distance to the Heart of the City. It is extremely quiet considering the location. The rooms are spacious and super comfortable, with well appointed large bathrooms. We noticed refillable bottles of shampoo and soap, which indicated their efforts to minimize waste. They offer complementary coffee and pastries in the morning in the main lobby. In the evening they host a complementary wine tasting event which allows you to mingle with other guests and share dining and/or shopping tips. Very pleasant. The hotel restaurant is not outstanding but certainly adequate for a casual meal or Happy Hour.

The front desk folks gave us toothbrushes and cards to get some much needed and appreciated wine! That got a rotten trip off to fun and laughs in the lobby! What a lovely gesture. Our room was very cool and so was our gold fish, Hayden.

<comment category="positive" id="UR68442874">...These people truly understand service. Our stay at The Monaco was no different than any other Kimpton Hotel meaning that no matter which one - they all understand how to serve their customers. It is so nice to be in a hotel where you get the distinct feeling that they are happy that you have chosen to stay there (vs the indifference I get from larger hotel chains). From the personal check-in (they know if you have been to one of their hotels before), to the freebies for wine, cocktails, breakfast. We were only to get one or the other, but they gave us all 3. Why? ...Because they could, and so they did. Had a little trouble logging my iPhone onto the (free for members) WiFi, so one of the guys at the front desk did it for me. Then called me 10 mins later to make sure it was still working. My only issue was the California blinds in the rooms.. stylin'- but they don't black out the room for sleeping. Seriously, if you are looking for a "hotel experience" rather than simply a place to crash, take a Kimpton. The Alexis...another Kimpton, just down the street from The Monaco is outstanding....but that's a whole other review.. Enjoy!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR67543063">We stayed in Hotel Monaco in Seattle after getting off of the Alaska cruise in early June. I had done extensive research on the downtown Seattle hotels before the trip. We wanted one that's near the attractions we could walk to, nice and clean rooms, friendly service, with a good price. I had several choices and decided on Hotel Monaco based on the reviews I read on this web site. It seemed to get consistent positive reviews. Well, we were not disappointed! In fact, we were very happy about our choice!! We had requested an early check-in since we disembarked in the morning. The rooms weren't ready yet, but the front desk girls who were very friendly and plesant told us she will call my cell phone when the rooms are ready. They happily stored away our luggages so we could go explore the town. They also showed us on the map how to get to certain places. A friend traveling with us was a librarian and the Seattle Central library was on her list of must-see. Image the plesant surprise when she found out the library was just across the street from the hotel! A couple of hours later, they called us to let us know our rooms were ready. I can't say enough about the front desk girls' plesant and courteous attitude - it just made us feel very welcome. The rooms were beautifully and tastefully decorated. And they were spacious!! This was important as we had tons of luggage from our week-long cruise. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. I liked the little gift shop that's at the end of the hotel. The next morning, we were plesantly surprised by the complementary Starbucks coffee, ice coffee, and banana cakes. Those cakes were so good!! They went perfect well with the coffee. Hmm... Wish I had some of them now... Overall, we were very pleased with our stay in Hotel Monaco. I could tell the hotel was making every effort to make sure the guests were welcome and comfortable. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR67042257">Very centrally located for shopping and night life. We walked to the Ballgame and then headed to a Jazz bar in the evening. Lots of good restaurants and close to the fish market. Simply had it all. The Hotel allows pets and we didn't encounter any problems...just the time it took to cuddle and coo over the dogs. Rooms are well equipped but pillows were questionable and I like a well lit room so it could have had a little more light. The Hotel restaurant was fun, especially sitting up by the cooks. They seem to genuinely enjoy entertaining you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66899084">We went to Seattle to see Teatro Zinzanni before my husband deployed and got a great rate here. The staff was super friendly and kind, a relaxing wine hour was enjoyed, and we even got a free upgrade to a larger size room/bed. The front staff were helpful and so pleasant and they even supplied umbrella's (hello-Seattle!) when we went for a walk and realized ours were in the car. The room was spotless and had great tasty snacks! I recommend joining Kimpton in Touch before you go so you can get some extra amenities like free wireless. Will definately stay in Kimptons' again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66814033">First of all... I love Kimpton properties. I tried staying at another non-Kimpton property and I regretted it to the point where I canceled my second night and booked at the Hotel Monaco. So, I was coming in to town from out of the country and I arrived late... probably around 10:15 or so. I was tired, frustrated, and just wanted food and a bed. The front desk clerk was so nice and kind to me; it made the difference. I had a room on the 11th floor, which I assume is because I'm a Kimpton In Touch member. I loved it! I love being on high floors. When I got in to the room, it was warm, cozy, and everything that I love. The bed was incredible and the bathroom was large and clean. I have a thing for bathrooms. Instead of dining downstairs, I decided to hop in the shower and order room service. I ordered a turkey bacon pannini at 10:45 and was told it would be about 25 minutes. I waited and waited, and finally I called at 11:45. Apparently my order got missed. They were quick to correct it and I had my sandwich by midnight. They did not charge me and they even gave me an adorable bag of chocolates. I appreciated their apology and effort to rectify the situation; I was more than happy, even if it was delayed. The only thing is, they still didn't get the sandwich correct; there was no bacon on the one that was delivered to me, which is what I was sorta craving. No matter... the sandwich was still delish and really enjoyed it. Just like I have a thing for bathrooms, I also have a thing for robes. The one thing I do not like about Kimpton are the robes. They are a funky animal pattern and the robes always seem kinda worn and faded. I can appreciate Kimpton's effort to be funky, original, and very chic through a simple feature, but there has to be a better option. It's not a big deal, but just sayin'... I love the shampoo, conditioner, and soap at the Hotel Monaco. I don't know who makes it or what the fragrance is, but it smells elegant and earth, organic and exotic, all at the same time. The products were in the shower in a pump, so I couldn't bring any home to research the products. When I like a hotel product, I try to bring the travel size home so I can research where I can get some for myself. Anyone know what products Hotel Monaco uses? Also, as a KIT member, I received a voucher for two free honor bar items. I didn't use the voucher, but it was a nice and appreciated touch. The valets were wonderful when I arrived and when I checked out. And when I got in my car, there was a little package with crackers and juice, tied with a little bow, and a card inside that said, "We miss you already." It made me smile, and I missed them, too! ;-) I cannot wait to stay at my next Kimpton hotel... and I cannot wait to go back to the Hotel Monaco!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66800358">This was my second year staying at The Hotel Monaco Seattle for business. I liked it so much last year that I extended my business stay two extra nights this year for some R&amp;R. It is so conveniently located...accross from the Public Library, just blocks from Pike Place Market and there is a full size grocery store a couple of blocks away as well as a Walgreens. We ordered room service and ate in the restaurant downstairs and both were excellent. The staff was very professional and eager to please. I will definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66678718">It had been several years since we stayed in Seattle. I knew we wanted to be in the downtown area- so I looked up DT hotels on line. Hotel Monaco was a four star hotel that came up along with several others-a bit out of our price range, but in looking at their web-site- they offered a better rate for two days. It was perfect for us. The hotel was beautiful- the staff were very courteous and most helpful. They had great suggestions for resturants and places to visit. The rooms were spacious and super clean. Great showers. We will definitely be back!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66459557">Selected by family members for the post-cruise overnight wind down before cross country travel the next day. The cruise was port intensive and no one was looking to tour Seattle with a lot of luggage. What we really needed when we got off the ship was a nap!. The front desk checked us in at 10 am and apologized that we were not on the same floor. They even had a goldfish and animal print robe ready and waiting for the grandchild. Room: tasteful and excellent bedding. (Monaco Suite). Bathroom: airy and spotless. Minibar: coupon with check in for $10 in goodies (minibar snacks are off limits after a disgraceful pigout resulting in a god-awful bill). 20% discount for riding AMTRAK + taxi voucher to train station. 2 blocks from light rail. 1.3 miles to cruise terminal.

<comment category="positive" id="UR66260123">We came to Seattle for the Memorial Day weekend to see family. What a great place to stay. We arrived from the airport around 10:30 and there were no rooms. The staff was great and held our luggage while we explored Pioneer Square. The front desk had my phone number and as soon as our room was ready, they called (It was probably less than an hour). Check in was easy. I have to mention the doormen. They were always friendly and very helpful. All of them smiled all the time. The front desk staff always said goodbye and hello when we were coming and going. The hotel also served free wine between 5-6 each night. What a nice touch. Two of the nights they made wine cocktails and the young lady fixing those was very sweet and pleasant. The room was very comfortable, with a big bath and big closet. I was a member of Kimpton's program, so had free internet. The hotel was close to everything and we walked all over downtown. Very close to the market. If you're visiting Seattle, you can't go wrong staying here. Thanks Hotel Monaco, you made our trip very enjoyable (despite the cold, rainy weather).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66070577">My wife and I arrived at the Hotel Monaco about 2 hours before check-in and we were immediately greeted by the front desk clerk (Hayden) who checked us in early and with a smile. The rooms were very clean and being a pet friendly hotel did not smell at all of pets which was a nice surprise. The location of the hotel is perfect, we took the light link rail from the airport and were dropped off at University Street one block from the hotel. Very central to Pike's Place Market, the Aquarium, Symphony, shopping, eateries you name it. We walked everywhere and always found our way back to the Hotel Monaco where we were always greeted by the doorman. One thing stood out the most and made us a believer in Kimpton hotels and that is the service. After our first day of exploring we came back to a room that wasn't made up, we called down and asked if they could make up the room, as we walked down the hall a housekeeper was on her way to our room - excellent! We would run into after that and she was always in a good mood. Thanks Hotel Monaco for a memorable stay! The wine happy hour didn't hurt either.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR65955593">we checked into the Monaco for a memorial day weekend "staycation" here in seattle. we booked on their website the night before and got a great AAA rate for a standard queen room. we chose the Monaco for the location downtown (short walk to market) and for their very open pet policy. in general, we also like the boutique feeling of their rooms - every one feels different. i am giving this an "excellent" because their service is wonderful. we were greeted so warmly (as was our dog) upon arrival and were given an immediate and free upgrade to a Mediterranean suite, which included a huge jetted tub for two and a king bed. it was awesome. the hotel was clearly dead for the weekend - bad weather and most people leave Seattle at this time of year - so i was glad to see that they were putting empty rooms to use to make current customers happier. thank you!<topic>none</topic>

Close to the waterfront, Pike St. Market and pretty much everything else we wanted to do for a first time to Seattle. The hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff wonderful; we never left the hotel without the doormen asking if we needed help with something.

<comment category="positive" id="UR62322421">5 old friends from university meet every year taking turns between eastern North America and the west. We have stayed in Vancouver, San Francisco and now Seattle in the west. Our accommodation in Seattle and the general ambiance of the Hotel Monaco was the best yet. We had 2 great rooms with both a king bed and curtained alcove with a hide a bed and a meeting room in between with a chesterfield/hideabed. The whole package was ideal for hanging out with friends. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Love the wine hour and Sazerac, the restaurant's Happy Hour. This is an incredible hotel. Everyone at the hotel ensured that our visit was customized to our individual, unique needs in order to provide the best possible guest experience. I highly recommend this hotel for any occasion as they will take care of you and your party as though you are the only guests on site.<topic>none</topic>

The exercise facility was just OK, but they offer a daily pass to a nearby health club at a fairly reasonable price if you are in need of a more extensive facility. The evening wine reception with the fortune teller, masseusse, etc was a very nioce touch.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR60698616">Spur of the moment, we decided to take a train to Seattle for a couple of quick days away. We decided on Hotel Monaco simply based on location (which is terrific) and pricing. From the moment we walked in, our experience was wonderful. I booked online and received the option of an upgrade which we received at a fantastic price. Let me first state that I am self employed (I own a tattoo studio) and I have found my outward appearance to have a negative impact when I travel, especially in nicer hotels. That was absolutely not our experience with Hotel Monaco... we were treated well and every staff we came across was warm and welcoming. We arrived a few hours prior to check in, our plan was to use the time to grab some lunch. The staff gladly secured our belongings and offered to call us when our room was ready. It was ready much earlier than expected. Both the front staff and porters were wonderful. They were quick to offer a hand and point us in the right direction when asked. The room was fantastic and the housekeeping staff was unusually happy and friendly. On our second night, we ate at the hotel's restaurant. We came in late and it was a busy night. I ordered a vegetarian dish. Soon the restaurant manager politely informed me that they were out of that dish... he had already consulted the chef and had recommendations readily available that met my dietary preferences. It was one of the best meals I'd eaten in a long time. Staff checked in soon after my first bite to make sure I was happy with everything, I couldn't have been happier. Upon checkout, again our train was leaving later than our check out time. Our bags were again securely stored even though we were no longer really staying at the hotel, when we retrieved them, staff offered to call our taxi and assist us until we were on our way back home. Dumb luck brought us to Hotel Monaco, however the next time we are in Seattle, we will be back because our first experience was so good. I would highly recommend them based on location, the accommodations and of course the wonderful people who really cared that we had a great couple of days away. By the way... this is my first review of a hotel like this. Just like most of you, I'm sure.... I am quick to share my negative experiences in hopes of making a small difference for the next patron (after all, this is an opportunity for hotels to learn and improve), however I am happy to be sharing this great experience with you, and I hope you have as wonderful experience as I did!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR58753135">GREAT HOTEL!!! GREAT LOCATION butâ€¦..Awful Front desk! The ladies who worked at the front desk of this hotel act like they hate being there. They are not pleasant or easy to work with. They act as if you are bothering them when you making a request. They also never seemed to have anything nice to say when you entered the lobby. There were no smiles, no cordial exchanges. I do know that there was a great disparity with the evening front desk staffâ€¦â€�It was like night and dayâ€� No pun intendedâ€¦but seriously the night staff was perfect. They had recommendations and there were plenty pleasant exchanges. Cami was very nice. I really am surprised being that this is a Kimpton Hotel. Why would such unpleasant staff be used on the front line? These young ladies who work in the day really need to take a class on being in the service industryâ€� I do ask that the hotel do something about this and to let me know because honestly these ladies are bringing the Kimpton name down. With that being said, I LOVED everything elseâ€¦The restaurant is FABULOS: the happy hour is great, excellent location, walking distance to lots of things. Great complimentary hot coco, coffee and wine. The doorman and cleaning staff were extremely nice and attentive...Overall itâ€™s a great hotel as long as you donâ€™t go to the front desk between 8am-8pm.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR58413108">Stayed in the hotel for two nights for business recently. Whilst the hotel is of a reasonable standard the front desk staff leave alot to be desired. I asked them for a power adapter and after 15 minutes of waiting they returned and said they would contact me. I returned to my room to then wait 30 minutes without being contacted. On returning to the front desk, they said they couldn't find one - but there was no apology for not contacting me to let me know this fact. They then said that engineering would be in in 15 minutes and they would then possibly be able to find one and let me know. After waiting a further 40 minutes from the scheduled time that engineering would turn up, there was still no answer. I returned to the front desk to be told off handedly that engineering didn't have one. Once again, no apology for the delay or lack of information. THe general seevice from the desk staff was uncaring and lacked professionalism. Conversely the porters were very helpfulTHere is no room service and it is impossible to get coffee before they present it in the lobby in the early hours of the morning. Sadly I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and found it the worst during my three week trip around the US.<topic>none</topic>

My colleague required a power adaptor for his computer, he requested this several times without any luck. When I asked the same question I was advised by the young gal at the front desk "We have already been on that wild goose chase for another guest, we don't have them".

<comment category="positive" id="UR56823565">Stayed 4 nights at the Kimpton hotel in a Monte Carlo Suite. - Layout of room was nice with sufficient space. - Bathroom was simple and clean. - Staff were hit or miss, with Jessica being friendly, but another being quite short when making requests. - Coffee machine was brought up to the suite after a phone call to guest services which was very welcomed. - The tap water was safe to drink but didn't taste too great, so we requested for pitchers of filtered water which was brought up without charge. - Didn't get any of the goldfish i'd been reading about but that didn't matter. - Free coffee in the morning and wine tastings at night are very nice with lots of people attending. - Great hotel location, within walking distance to anywhere (Seattle is a great walking city). - Didn't use valet parking due to price, opting instead for "around the corner street parking" - Valet did help inquire about town car service to Seattle, but quote came back far too high. - Nearby lots of nice cafes and restaurants (Purple, etc) - Starbucks two doors down (but that is standard anywhere in Seattle) - Quiet hotel - never heard any of our neighbors as some reports had mentioned. - Gym is small but has standard equipment (treadmill was out of order) - Free internet was useful (for Kimpton members) Finally, i would say the value is decent and would probably repeat if in Seattle again. Prior to my trip I considered staying at either the Fairmont or Monaco, and looking back i'm glad i ended up choosing the Monaco. The Fairmont looked old and worn from the inside.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR55707910">I came to SEA to celebrate my birthday, not that the number of years was anything to brag about, but it's mine so that makes it special. I arrived by cab and was greeted by Anthony who being the expert with wheelchairs that he is had mine at my side in no time flat! I have arrived at this building some 1900 times and WOW has it changed. the building used to house switching machinery and operator services for the phone company. I had requested a Monte Carlo suite. It was huge and wonderfully done in what can only be called eclectic. Color scheme was in red and cream with a headboard in sky blue. My room was graced with a sweet flower arrangement of roses and freesia for which I have Jesse the Chef Concierge(I asked if he had a spit personality) to thank. The bed was a bit hard for my bones but the sheets felt great. I had lunch and dinner at the restaurant Sazerac and both meals were wonderful. Lunch was simple with a marvelous spicy, meaty gumbo and an"heirloom apple" salad. The salad was dressed with a simple vinigrette and layered on speck a cured ham. Be warned portions were more than ample. Delicious. I had breakfast in my room the next morning. I had been given coupons for a continental breakfast, alas they weren't good for room service. My meal was served by Matthew a genial fellow who graciously comped my coffee to make up. Prices were typical for a room service menu, and I was served quickly. The food was great. I ordered "Eggs from Hell" a spicy little number! A word of warning to those in wheelchairs, only two of the accessible rooms have roll in showers where u can reach the towel rack. In my room the towels were placed on a rack mounted on the back wall out of reach for us wheelies. There also wasn't a handheld shower unusual for an accessible suite. The other access issue I encountered was that door returns on my room and on the business center did not meet the pressure standards in the ADA for opening doors. They were difficult to open and in case of the business center assistance is required as the door was too narrow for someone in a chair. I had to have Jesse open the second door so I could enter the center. The hotel is located downtown at Fourth and Spring sts a great location for shopping, theater and eating out. It was a $5.00 ride from King Street Station. I was treated like a million by all the staff I encountered at the hotel. They made me feel like I was the Sultan of Brunei. I will make the Monaco my home when I travel to the Emerald city. It's a winner!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR53689312">I stayed at Hotel Monaco because I was sent to Seattle for work, and it was located close to the office. I got a decent rate of $132/night for a room with a King bed. The hotel is definitely fairly well kept up and the service is friendly. I like the fact that they have wine served in the lobby between 5P-6P, and coffee and tea served between 7A-9A, courtesy of the hotel. However, I found that the lobby gets pretty packed with guests wanting their free coffee/wine on the weekends so there's no place to sit down. Also, one morning they ran out of coffee in the lobby, and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to bring out some more. The hotel's restaurant, Sazerac, is a good restaurant with pretty good drinks. It was convenient being able to get a nice dinner in the hotel. Just be sure to make reservations for dinner, since it can get pretty busy there during Happy Hour on the weeknights. The thing I wasn't so happy about with the hotel are its thin walls. I could hear my neighbors talking and moving about, and could really feel the neighbor's kids jumping on the bed. It makes you wonder if there would be any privacy for a romantic weekend, if you get my drift. Also, the doors on the tv cabinet were askew. Also, I'm not sure why it's so difficult to find a decent workout room in a hotel. I tried out Hotel Monaco's fitness room, and found that the equipment was pretty out-dated. The one treadmill in the room wasn't evening working, and they charged guests if they wanted to hook headsets into the tv monitors attached to the machines. There were no mats to sit and stretch on and the quarters were tight. I'm accustomed to cycling machines, but the resistance of Monaco's cycling machine was really off, and I had a difficult time cycling with just a resistance of 2, which should be really easy. Although the goldfish rentals appear to appeal to some, it seems a little abusive to me. I was uncomfortable with seeing the "used" goldfish, left out in front of the rooms, once the guests were done with them. Maybe Hotel Monaco should just set up a nice, well-kept stationary fish tank in the lobby for all to enjoy. I bet the fish would be happier, and isn't that the point of the fish tanks? It's supposed to be for animal lovers. Overall, Hotel Monaco was a comfortable place to stay. I like it's smaller size, compared to the Sheraton and Hyatt down the street. It gives it a more cozy feel, and probably encourages more personal service. The location is very convenient for sightseeing, yet far enough away from the noisier downtown shopping areas near Nordstrom's.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53116655">We got a very good deal on staying here through a site like Priceline and were really happy with the place. Such great service from the start and right throughout our 2 night 3 day stay there. The staff even wrote down bus directions for us to get to Alderwood Mall etc. The room and bathroom was clean and comfortable and really felt like luxury. Location was perfect. Just a short walk to everything Seattle has to offer... the only qualm we had with the place is room service. Our breakfast was late and pretty much cold when it arrived.

<comment category="positive" id="UR52805632">Sometimes fate just smiles on you, and that is just how we felt about this jewel of hotel. We got our room through Priceline, so we got a deal, but the staff was very friendly and helpful! They couldn't have been nicer! The room was very clean, although a little smallish, and the bed was very comfortable. The room had a little refrigerator, which we used to store some snacks and drinks. The hotel has a great location just 4 or 5 blocks from the main shopping district with lots of name brand stores. Pike's Market is 8 or 9 blocks away--an easy 15 minute walk. There are some excellent restaurants in the area. We ate dinner at Brooklyn's and we had a couple breakfasts at Bacco's. The hotel is also only a couple blocks from an IGA grocery store and Walgreen's drug store on 3rd AV. The excellent public transportation system is also right there. You can now ride the train all the way to the airport from just a short distance away from the hotel. Some very nice extras I want to mention: Coffee in the morning (FREE) in the beautiful lobby was excellent and gets the day started right. Later in the afternoon, they serve hot chocolate (FREE), which really tastes fantastic after coming in from the cool outdoors. Early in the evening, they did a nice wine tasting hour in that same beautiful lobby. That is an outstanding way to start the evening and really was a nice surprise! I was very impressed with the attention to detail the staff exhibited! This is a really well-run hotel, and we would gladly stay there again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR52501753">We do an annual overnight trip to Seattle using Priceline roulette - bid on a 4 star and see what you get. This is the first year we got The Monaco, and it turned out quite nice. They put us in a nice room with two beds (my wife and teenage son - 3 of us total). The room was spacious and nicely furnished. They are pet-friendly, and although we left our dog with friends, the hotel "loans" you goldfish to keep you company. Sounds corny, but Robert the Goldfish spent a nice evening with us. The hotel is right across the street from the fabulous Seattle Library and close to many other amenities. The in-hotel restaurant, Sazarec (?) is, however, only average. We ate two meals there which were hit and miss depending on what you ordered. But the free wine tasting every night helps . . . .<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR50774722">I used to live in Seattle &amp; always loved downtown. This hotel is located in a great area: quiet but very accessible to EVERYTHING a tourist would want to see- Pikes Place, Pioneer Square, shopping district, First Hill... The area is very safe, so not to worry about that. There is a Starbucks next door (naturally) &amp; a few other dining establishments very near. From the airport, we took the connector bus to the light rail (no need to take bus by Jan '10) &amp; it drops you off (University stop) literally 1 1/2 blocks away. $2.50 per person is much cheaper than the $40 cab ride. The staff is polite, very helpful, &amp; they all remember the guests. We asked for a "quiet" floor &amp; despite booking on hotels.com (for $130 total midweek), they relocated us to the 9th floor. Although our view was of another building, it was peaceful. The decor is very loud, but fun &amp; the entire hotel was spotless (&amp; I searched). I did find some small stains on a couple towels, a gross vent in the bathroom along with some soapscum, &amp; some scuffs on wall corners, but considering the rest of the experience I gladly ignored those minor things. I was a little confused about the heater because it seemed to stay at 72 degrees no matter how high I turned it up: strange. I had a touch of the flu, so this was really the only thing that irritated me. The bathrooms counters are a nice granite &amp; they offer Aveda bathroom toiletries. I'd highly recommend Hotel Monaco for anyone. Never learned what you need to do to have a friendly fish in your room! Enjoy.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR50499324">We were in Seattle for a quick weekend getaway to do some shopping, see a show, and take in the holiday decorations downtown. We arrived to the hotel about 2pm and were pleased that our room was ready for check-in. Valet and check-in staff were all friendly and efficient. Hotel parking is high, $40 a night, but from previous reviews I see management is quick to point out this is the going rate for downtown hotels. Booked our room on the Kimpton website. When checking rates again before arrival rates had gone down. Kimpton reservation line quickly rebooked with new lower rate. The hotel is in a great location, a 10 minute walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do. Christmas tree in the lobby was beautiful and we enjoyed the tarot card reader and a glass of wine before dinner. We've had several stays at Kimpton hotels this year, normally we receive an email from the concierge asking if there is a special celebration or if we need help with dinner reservations, etc. before our stay which is a really nice touch. Didn't receive one from this property. Usually receive a newspaper delivered to our door in the morning, not this time, but newspapers were available downstairs in the lobby along with coffee and tea service. We received a $10 raid the honor bar coupon and a welcome note in our room at check-in which was a nice touch. Our room rate also included coupons for either two continental breaksfasts or two cocktails. We are aware that the Kimpton hotels are pet-friendly. It's never been an issue and we enjoy seeing the pups in the hotel. I was told at one time that guests with pets are assigned different rooms/floors for stays than those guests with no pets. I have pet allergies and have never had a problem before. Couldn't figure out why I was sneezing so much during the night then realized we must have been assigned a room previously occupied by guests with pets. I contacted the hotel and they're are making note in my record about pet allergies.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR50394655">I live in Vancouver BC and decided to travel south to Portland and Seattle for the weekend. We hit Portland first, then on our way back we stayed one night in Seattle. After that longgg drive from Portland, I was exhausted and needed a good night sleep. The Monaco definitely provided that. The front desk staff was friendly, did my check-in in about 2 minutes...which was great because I was dying to just lay down. The room is a good size, large enough to park our baby's giant stroller in front of the closet and we still had room to walk around it. The bed was quite comfortable. The bathroom was clean and stocked with Aveeda products. Everything looked newish. I slept like a baby all night. Will definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR50217186">I booked this hotel on Priceline.com and bid $75 per night for 11/26-11/29.t Pros: Great rate, good location, clean, okay room - a 3 star max though. Cons: Parking is $40 per night - highest in area. I wanted coffee so asked the front desk on the way up is there a coffee maker in the room. "No, but the rest. is open." I said I want it in my room. "You can order room service". I don't want to order room service to get coffee in my room. "I'll have a coffee maker sent up". LOL. They keep them in the closets in the hall if people insist - otherwise they make a little more money on room service. The "buffet" for Thanksgiving was $40 per plate. Hmmmmmm. Restaurants were closed and they took advantage of that. 2 scrambled eggs for breakfast, $18. Bottom line: Shop around and make sure you factor in the parking as part of the room rate. Probably still a good deal so if you come be ready to fight back on their nickel and diming game. 1) Bring your own snacks and cocktails and stay away from their overpriced mini-bar. 2) Eat outside the hotel. 3) Make certain they bring you a coffee maker when you check in and bring your own coffee because you know you'll have to fuss everytime you need a new pack.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR49013039">We got a great deal on our room and were really pleased with our stay! We spent the weekend exploring Seattle, and the location was perfect. we also really enjoyed the complimentary wine hour from 5-6 on weekdays. And, there's free tea and coffee in the mornings. Staff was friendly and courteous - even printed our boarding passes for us on super short notice. We could walk everywhere we needed to go - even to Qwest Field for a football game. And, the "guppy love" was a great touch, as were the super cool in-room robes. The hotel seemed to be very pet friendly. Only downside was the very expensive valet parking - $40 per night! if you can get there without a car, do it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR48792489">The staff was courteous, helpful, and cheerful; the decor was elegantly funky (and comfortable); and the amenities were nice (and the kids' welcome gift was delightful and just right for our adventures in the city). The location, right across the street from the main library, was convenient to many of our travel spots. Bring comfortable walking shoes because most places are within a decent walking radius, but some of those hills made us pretty tired after we hiked them several times a day! There are several free bus options within the business district to help you get to spots a bit further away, such as the Space Needle, or if you don't want to tackle those hills. We enjoyed the wine hour each evening before dinner, the kids enjoyed the popsicles each afternoon (esp, because Seattle was experiencing one of it's hottest heat waves) and we all loved our room goldfish. Beds were comfortable, room was not terribly spacious, but it was fine as we were there mainly to sleep. We received a very good rate by contacting the hotel directly. We are going back next summer and will be staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR48455152">Just got back from a fantastic stay at the Hotel Monaco. Thought this was excellent location for a downtown Seattle trip- only a 10-min. walk or so to the Market, or to the Monorail to Seattle Ctr., and generally positioned right in the middle of things. Further, thought the staff was very friendly &amp; customer-service focused. Concierge gave great advice; cleaning staff was very good; front desk very friendly. Enjoyed the "wine" happy hours they host for free in the lobby every night. Room was very pleasant, however, our room didn't have any view (it looked into a wall), so if that's important, may want to look into that ahead of time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46677946">We went through priceline and got a great deal for a quick overnight. It was $99 for the night. This boutique hotel is elegant and fun. The room and hotel decor is unique and the staff were very helpful. When we checked in we immediately went up to our room. It was nice but our window looked out at another window of a building that was very close. We went back down to the front desk and asked if there was another room that had a window with a better view. We were immediately given a room with a side view which had much better lighting. We went to happy hour at the restaurant of the hotel and the prices and food were very good. I think we spend less than $20 for 2 drinks and 3 appetizers, and there was lots of food left over. The rooms were nicely appointed although on the small side, but that is to be expected with this type of hotel. We loved waking up in the morning just a few blocks from the Seattle waterfront and going for a run along the waterfront. The one downside (which we didn't know when making reservations) was that parking was $45 per night!! We ended up parking in the Seattle Public Library overnight for about $20. I would definitely go back to this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR46587286">I stayed there last night, it , was quite average. Frankly, I thought the courtyard Marriott in Bellevue was better. Room was small, overpriced mini bar. It was clean, but there was ABSOLUTELY nothing special about it, VERY MEDIOCRE, never saw a gold fish in my room either. Smoke alarm started beeping in my room at 2am and someone had to shut it off. So, my whole purpose for paying for a hotel... was to sleep there, was not even fulfilled. When I tried to call the front desk, their phone did not work. Also when you pull in, the valet opens the door for you... not telling you that the valet service is $40.00!!! for 1 night!!!we went and found free parking a block a way on the street. I must say, they claim to be very luxurious and have great sservice, i didnt really see any of that. And I think got allergies staying there because they allow pets in their hotel, maybe the room was not cleaned properly? The service, i found them very average, kind of aloof actually. They must have great marketing people because it was only ok for me.<topic>none</topic>

Good location for business travelers if at a downtown location for work. Fitness center is present but lacking. They offer a deal with a nearby gym, however, it is cheaper to get day passes for $10 at nearby gym, Core fitness. Cool: They have Gold fish in fish bowls with name tags in the hallways! Not so cool: No microwave and no fridge (beside the honor bar one) Tip: Beside a regular location map... be sure to check a topo map as well.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR45675782">We arrived early after disembarking from our Alaskan cruise......we were not allowed to check in early as the rooms had not been cleaned from a full house the night before......this was understandable as we DID want a clean room. Since we had a rental car, we drove around the city for a few hours until checkin. From the second we got there, the guys at the front desk/porter were AMAZING!!!! Since this is your first impression of a hotel, we were already hooked. They are helping you out of your car and have your luggage out almost before u have stopped the car in front! Truly attentive!!!! Our room was nice and comfortably furnished....not cramped....they have several items available if u have forgotten yours (ie; toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, shaving cream, heating pads, etc) and I don't think there is an extra charge for this stuff, but it may be minimal. The girl that checked us in was a little standoffish (maybe she is new?)....she stated that since we made our reservations thru Orbitz, she had limited rooms available to us. While we have long known that hotels usually give the least desirable rooms to people who use a discount travel site, we did not feel everyone in the hotel lobby checking in at the same time, needed to have this information. She told us there was a charge for the internet ($10 a day, I think), coffee in the morning, and I think a wine reception in the evening (we are nondrinkers). When we inquired later about how to use the internet, a different receptionist told us to sign up with the Kimpton Rewards program and we would have free internet for our entire stay. It would have been helpful if we were given this info during the checkin process. The rest of our 3 day stay was uneventful with the front/checkin/out desk....and everyone was very nice. Now back to the Porter service.......WOW! we can't say enough good things about these guys....They truly made our stay a wonderful one. Try them instead of the concierge...they truly know the area and won't give u the names of all the "Top" spots, but will give u the names (and directions to boot!) of all the BEST places. While all the Porters were very frindly and helpful, Anthony was the absolute best!, and if any management reads this, please send him our gratitude and note that you have an outstanding employee who would be fabulous with many more customer service responsibilities than working at the front desk/porter area! He made our experience at Hotel Monaco that much better. Tell him hi when u stay at this hotel.......and tip these guys well....they appreciate it and u will be rewarded..... We did not try the restaurant next door.......but they were always packed, so it must have been good food. Instead we tried Rock Bottom a couple of blocks away......GREAT simple food pizza, burgers, etc and not priced over the top. They probably have other stuff ,too, like seafood dishes as everywhere in Seattle does. We also went to a FABULOUS Itallian restaurant called Assaggio's on 3rd and Virginia...EXCELLENT! We stayed at the Westin 3 days prior to our cruise....they are VERY snobby.....especially when you have booked thru "one of those discount websites"......don't even bother with the Westin.....go straight to Hotel Monaco where u will be treated right. Put your walking shoes on for your trip to Seattle.....everything is UPHILL!!!! :-)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39194554">This is definitely not the cookie-cutter type hotel one is used to in America. They are definitely trying to be different -- from the choices of wallpaper to the complimentary goldfish, to the parade of dogs (most of them extremely well behaved) in the lobby. While there are definitely some misses -- and I can see how some guests could have disappointing stays -- overall this hotel is fun, comfortable and extremely well located for downtown Seattle. Definitely try to avoid bringing a car here as parking is expensive and most destinations are walkable, or accessible using the excellent public transportation. I found most of the staff to be very professional and friendly, and more than willing to help with special requests. I detected no snootiness, and little pretention. Unless you are totally not into "cool," I think most guests will enjoy the atmosphere. The free early evening cocktail party is definitely a plus, and the hotel goes out of its way to make children (and pets!) welcome. My only real hesitation in recommending this hotel is price. Honestly, it's not worth their typical rates. But if you can plan ahead, or are willing to try services such as hotwire, you can often snag a good deal here. Enjoy!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39153815">My partner learned he required cancer treatment starting mid-September, so we wanted a last minute getaway along the pacific coast so we could be ready and calm for his surgery. Our regular haunts in Seattle were booked, so on a lark, we tried "Hotwire" for the first time. We did not know about Hotel Monaco without the benefit of Hotwire, and per the Hotwire instructions I contacted the hotel about room types. Then I read a Tripadviser response from the hotel dated April 7, 2009 that didn't resonate well with us (basically the message I interpreted is that you are hooped if you book Hotel Monaco through Hotwire). Our flights had us arriving early into Seattle and I advised the hotel about the arrival and my partner's condition (made worse by a foot injury a day before our trip). For us, front desk was an exercise in what could not be done; 1) My partner slept in the lobby from about noon to 1445hrs; regular check-in is at 1500hrs, 2) We did not learn about having to request coffee or tea en suite; I learned about it the next AM when I saw another hotel guest in the lobby with coffee mugs, 3) the quirky goldfish element wasn't mentioned at check-in, so I asked twice about it the next day, 4) I asked the same front desk clerk who checked us in to have the burnt out light addressed by the bed...it wasn't. I asked someone else and it was fixed immediately. Another shift supervisor learned about our poor experience and sent up wine, chocolates and a handwritten note as a gesture of service recovery and for that we are thankful. At check-out I advised the same agent who checked us in nothing I asked of her was done, so she blamed the other areas. From doormen to housekeeping to maintenance, everyone else was great. Only check-in was brutal and front desk service was uneven. The rooms are small per building period, made smaller by the bold striping and the lack of natural light as the room faced another building, but extremely clean and the room in a location quiet. We were OK with Aveda toilettries, though dissappointed it wasn't L'Occitane. I suspect the Hotel Monanco views Hotwire bookings as the no frills/budget bookings and not "found" bookings (when in fact we paid more than if we booked directy; we just didn't know about the hotel). We are fond of boutique hotels (our favorite is in Palm Springs), but for us this one was a miss. In summary, if you are fortunate enough to discover Hotel Monaco on your own and not through a third party as we did, I expect your experience may be different than ours. Because there are other choice properties in Seattle, it's unlikely we'll be back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39054379">I stayed here for 4 nights on business and found it to be a great location for getting around Seattle, both for meetings during the day and then for a little bit of sightseeing in the evenings. It's 2-3 quick blocks from the University St. station on the new light rail (and bus tunnel), diagonally across the street from Rem Koolhaas' beautiful public library building, and within 5-10 minutes' walk of major downtown sites like the Pike Place Market, Convention Center, waterfront, and ferry terminal. Rooms are decorated in that funky Kimpton style that you will either love or hate. Personally, I thought the decor was fun (leopard-print bathrobes!) and my room, though not huge, was more than adequate and very clean. It was also nice and cool despite the heat wave in Seattle at that time. I heard very little noise from the street below and the curtains actually closed all the way so that I could keep out unwanted light. Check-in and check-out were both easy, and on arrival I found a little "welcome" note from the staff in the room, along with a bottle of spring water and a bag of sweets from a local chocolate company - a nice touch. Breakfast at Sazerac was delicious and the staff were very friendly and efficient. There are some nice little touches like fancy trays of jam &amp; butter to go with your croissant and interesting Asian-style teapots. It would have been helpful if they opened earlier than 7 am; each day I had to sit down as soon as they opened in order to have time to eat before my meetings. My only quibbles with the hotel were (1) they are not yet 100% non-smoking, and this was not obvious on their website; it might be worth calling them to confirm that you will have a non-smoking room, and (2) the hotel staff were not terribly knowledgeable about the downtown area when I asked for directions. But these are pretty minor complaints compared to the otherwise pleasant experience. I would be inclined to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle, whether on business or on vacation.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR36546299">I just wanted to write and thank the lovely staff. The first time I stayed there I was getting married, so I chose to stay in the city the night before and I chose the Hotel Monaco. They upgraded us to a suite on the top floor for free and the wine hour in the lounge was a nice break for us. The wine was nice and they had bottles of it for sale. I'm sorry I can't remember anyone's name, it was such a busy time for me but we just went back and stayed the night and everything was the same. The only bad part was the overnight valet, it costs $40, yikes! I used sidestep to book a room and the deciding factor was the Aveda products they stock there. The room was $190 for the night which is spendy, but actually pretty fair for a 4 star hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR36507771">From the minute my husband and I set foot in the Hotel Monaco we knew we were in for a fun stay. The hotel's lively decor hints at playful accomodations and it didn't dissapoint. Our room, though small, was perfect for our needs with a good bed, reading lamps, a table and two chairs, and uplifting with its sea blues, corals, yellows and reds. We loved the color scheme and looked forward to returning to its comfort during the record-breaking Seattle heat wave which occured during our stay. And the service is splendid. It included an almost immidiate visit from the hotel engineer when we reported a light not functioning, friendly greetings every time we entered the front door, a concierge hosted wine hour wine hour, the printing of boarding passes, the use of the hotel town car for the airport trip, restaurant reservations, directions to and from locations in the city, the offer of a goldfish to be named by you as a companion to replace a left-at-home pet, popsicles and cookies during the hot afternoon and even a tarot card reading.

<comment category="positive" id="UR30558474">I was with my boyfriend, so we wanted to stay in a nice hotel that was also conveniently located. We were looking for hotels within walking distance to the Public Market (this hotel was just a few blocks away), and also, to other parts of downtown. The room was nice, clean and quiet. However, we thought the hotel staff should have been more up-front about the prices of some of their services. We were given a walk-in rate of $165/night, which was fine. But when we checked out after staying one night, my boyfriend found out the valet parking cost $40. We also had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, which was very good, but it would have been nice if our server had mentioned that the orange juice was not included in the price of the buffet. It was $4/glass! I would recommend this hotel for the location, rooms and ambience. But I would suggest asking about all the extra costs beforehand so that you are not in for any surprises.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26888125">Stayed here with 2 friends after booking on Hotwire for $96 US plus tax. I called the hotel to inquire whether a room with 2 queens was available. The agent said no, but would make a note on the file for us - I said we'd be fine with a rollaway too. The hotel was centrally located downtown, with a Starbucks next door, and there was the usual Kimpton wine reception in the lobby from 5-6pm, which was great after shopping! Aveda bath amenities (always appreciated!) and an adequate, if small, fitness room downstairs. We managed to avoid the $40/night (!!) parking charge by finding free street parking (after 6pm Sat) around the corner. Staff seemed friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and tasteful - love the goldfish in the elevator lobby, too! My only complaints: 1) not good sound-prooing: you can hear pipes running and doors slamming all night, and the vacuuming early on a Sunday was not appreciated; and 2) when we actually received a room with 2 queens (which were more like doubles), I did not expect to be charged $30 extra for this on my credit card... no one told me on check-in, and I did not get a printed receipt on check-out, I only discovered it 3 days later when looking at my statement online. In my opinion they DEFINITELY should have asked us if we wanted to pay $30 extra for the "upgrade" - it kind of defeated the purpose of the cheap Hotwire rate. Anyway, I'd stay again if I got a good deal, but just be warned about those extra fees... they can add up!<topic>none</topic>

Our room was average in size, fun colors and decor, Aveda products in the bath, cozy robes, Starbucks coffee and even a large umbrella for those rainy Seattle days. The street noise was a bit much for us because we like to sleep in, but the staff delivered a free fan which took care of the problem. Dining, drinking and Pike's were all within walking distance (in good weather) or a $5 cab ride in not so great weather. There is a bloody mary bar on Saturday and Sunday morning. The barstaff in Sazarac made excellent and creative cocktails and were friendly beyond what would normally be expected. The same can be said for the entire staff of the hotel throughout our stay.

So by the time we got to the hotel (8 hours later) we were exhausted and we appreciated the staff greeting us with genuine friendliness and warmth from the doorman to the front desk!! The check-in was so quick they had us on route to our room within 5min!! The room was HUGE!!! Bed was comfortable, everything was very clean and animal print robes were hanging in the closet for guest use. Aveda bath products were great quality. We had a small bite at Sazerac which is the restaurant in the hotel. It was very convenient and had good quality food. Restaurant also provided room service. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and efficient!! Happy Hour had great deals!! I loved the idea of the wine hour in the evenings, we unfortunately didn't take advantage of it, but it was very popular. The complimentary Starbuck coffee and tea in the lobby helped us get a jump on our day! I was nervous about the location as it was my first visit to Seattle, but it seemed like anywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance or a $5 cab ride. If you book this hotel you will not be disappointed :)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24456908">Got a good deal from Hotwire -$109 for a snowy January stay. Front desk was efficient, Bell captain was eager to help at the door - "Wow, you travel light!" My room was clean, facing an alley to an office building. The room was clean, very clean in fact, for a 4* hotel. But,... you'll hear the neighbors' doors slamming shut at night and in the morning. Maybe I am such a light sleeper. The plumbing was loud too, when your neighbors take a shower, you'll hear it. Thermostat is digital and it is quiet. Went one block north and had a great dinner at Purple Cafe. The next day, had dinner at Tulio's one block east, good also. If the price is right, I would stay here again. Not sure if it is worth &gt;$300/night though. Just my humble opinion.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24453252">If you enjoy something other then a big box hotel, then Hotel Monaco is for you. We originally booked a reservation through the hotel, but about 1 week before our stay I noticed a better rate on Hotel.com. We called the hotel and they matched that price! Happy Hour wine tasting from 5-6 was fun. One night the entertainment was Guitar Hero and the next a Native American card reader. Unfortunately, there were only about 12 seats in the lobby where they have the Happy Hour and so many guests were forced to stand. Our room was huge, but the furniture placement could have been better. There was a night stand only on one side of the bed which made it hard for my husband to find a place for his glasses and the remote! Location is very good and I'd stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24108684">the service was great. when the safe and heat didn't work in the room, they were very prompt in fixing things. all the staff are very friendly and professional. some guests may have pets with them. there was a loud dog barking next to my room for a a few hours. I told management and somehow i didnt hear the dog again. i just hope they clean the rooms pets stayed in extra hard too. The location is great too. can walk to all the great things downtown. it baffles me why people can leave their big dogs at home and baffles me that 4 star hotel lets dogs stay in the rooms. some dogs carry fleas!!:(<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23701297">Let me start by saying we booked using Priceline, which I have never tried before. We got an incredible rate for the Hotel Monaco. I was very skepticle, as I had never heard of this hotel before and we used to live just an hour north of Seattle. I jumped on this website and found much relief. Now onto the review. We arrived late Friday night and were very impressed with our first impression. A beautiful hotel just a few blocks from downtown shopping. The first thing I noticed was a Starbucks right next door, as well as Seattles Best Coffee across the street. A good start! The staff was very freindly and although valet parking was $40 a night, these guys went through hoops to make you feel special. Since paying much less then rack, we were ok with paying top dollar parking rates. We brought our daughter, 12, and her freind, 13 on this trip. They had delivered (upon prior request) goldfish in bowls for them to enjoy over the weekend. Nice touch! The rooms are very cozy and beds equally comfortable. Kids loved the flatscreen TV. The next morning we had coffee in room, as well as more from the lobby area. We really enjoyed this service. We walked to Pike Place Sat. am and had breakfast at "The Crumpet Shop". Well liked by all. When we went to retrieve our car, the valet opened the door and called my husband by name...nice touch!. I noticed that they have "kid packs" available for children. When we went out Saturday night, I asked id they would deliver them to our room. The kids were so excited to get this surprise. Also, the hotel has a wine reception between 5-6pm, which was really nice. I really was expecting less then perfect service having booked on priceline, but I must say, we were blown away by this place. Already planning our next trip back and will definatly stay here again without hesitation. This was one of our best hotel stays ever. Thanks Hotel Monaco!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23503377">My wife and I booked a last minute get away to Seattle. We got a great price on Priceline most likely due to the time of year and the flooding they have been experiencing west of the Cascades. But what a great weekend and great hotel. The hotel is very tastefully decorated and all of the staff were extremely helpful. They also offered wine tasting Saturday night and had Starbuck's coffee available Sunday morning in the hotel lobby. The location was perfect - within walking distance to all that we had planned for our short stay. Our only complaints were the overpriced valet parking - $40/day, and no pool or jacuzzi. But overall, we had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

There was no pool which we would of liked. The view from our room was sweet. The location of the hotel was perfect. Its a nice walk to shopping and down to pikes market.

From the goldfish in the room (which my daughter loved) to the fact that the valet parking staff who put on my chains on for me it was fabulous. The staff was attentive and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Oh, and about the parking: the charge is about what you would pay at any garage or lot- and I bet they wouldn't help you out in the snow!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21750932">We got a good deal to stay at this hotel for our anniversary. We arrived late in the evening, and we took the advice of previous reviews and did the valet parking. Check in was very quick and easy. We were a little disappointed by the (non-existent) view from the room, but the room itself was clean and a nice size. The bed was comfortable, but I woke up with a stiff neck from the high pillows. It was not as soundproof as we like...we heard music from the next room at night, and in the morning there were loud bangs from doors opening and closing, and we could hear people talking in the hallway. Maybe we just had noisy neighbors. The aveda bath products were nice. We did not get a goldfish for our stay, though that is a nice touch and we would've taken advantage of it if we were staying longer. Location is great, within walking distance of shopping. Overall a nice experience, except for having to pay $40 for parking one night!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21554916">Location and service are great. The valet was a doll, the front desk got me to my room quickly and everytime I passed through the lobby, the staff had huge smiles on their faces. I will be staying here often and would recommend to anyone. Valet parking is the only way to go. Starbucks is on the same block for those who need their lattes first thing in the morning!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20856362">I am a Diamond Member at Hilton but decided to give this chain a shot when I had my 20th Anniversary in Seattle. Well to start off I booked a suite and paid extra and then found that their website description is not what you get. A suite has more than a bedroom and a bathroom (standard hotel room). When I took my printed reservation down to the front desk and showed them that it said things like two TV, a couch, ect, the desk clerk told me "oh, they mixed two suites into the same description on the Kimpton Website - sorry about that how about a free breakfast". You got to be kidding me! Even Embassy Suits has a sitting room, bathroom and bedroom unlike what Kimpton calls "a suite". I was here for a 5 day stay and this was how they offer to correct false advertising? I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest. The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags. Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice! Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable. Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night. If you are light sensitive, you will have to tape something over the controls. This is not a 4 start hotel, it a very clean business hotel with super high rates. You can do better at any of the chain hotels in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20096360">The Hotel Monaco in Seattle is a good hotel but I wouldn't put it at 4* level. Positives: Large bathroom (Mediterranean Suite) Comfortable bed &amp; pillows Attentive housekeeping staff Negatives: AC unit malfunctioned throughout the stay Front desk disorganized. Missed 3 separate wakeup calls. Concierge was always busy and hard to get in touch with. Didn't provide much guidance on special requests. TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning. ---- I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower. Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival. Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing. In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!) I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten. The bathroom facilities were great in this room but I was surprised that a room sold for its whirlpool bath tub wouldn't have had any bath amenities. It was great to relax in the water with the jets going.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17672001">Hotel was in a really good location. The staff was very friendly. Use the valet at the hotel. You'll end up paying just as much to park it in a parking garage that is further away. We didn't eat at the restaurant although it looked great. The room was clean and bigger than we expected for a Hotel Monaco. Short walk to Pike's Market and several restaurants (and coffee shops of course!).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17541391">Agree with all of the positive reviews for the Monaco. It's located in the heart of downtown Seattle and walking distance to Pike Place and other downtown spots. Rooms were very clean and functional and we loved some of the interesting touches. For example you can request a goldfish as a temporary pet and the faux animal terry robes were very comfortable. The one negative was the parking fee as others have also commented on. I'm not sure if $40/day is the norm in Seattle - it is convenient to have the car valet parked - but something to note. Overall we were very pleased and would consider staying at the Monaco again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17032828">I just left the Monaco and would say that this hotel has absolutely everything for the business traveller. Firstly, in all my years of travel, I have never come across such a friendly, welcoming, and inviting staff outside of Asia. That alone makes this hotel stand out from most US hotels. But there is much more to recommend it. The location is good for anyone staying in Seattle for a conference, or with a need to be downtown. The convention center is appx 10 miute walk, but conversely, it is closer to the waterfront and Pikes Place. The room was outstanding. The bed was large and luxurious, Internet (both wired and WIFI) available at no charge to guests and with a very good signal. The desk was adequate size for working and the room itself was not cramped. Paper at your door every morning. Good coffee (but then again, it is Seattle...). The gym left a bit to be desired, but it was adequate and what was there was new, clean and in great working order,and it was available 24 hours. And they did have a reciprocal agreement with a full health club nearby. The hotel has a bit of a funky vibe (complete with faux leopard-skin robes in the closet), but not so much as to turn off even the most conservative business traveller. In summary, I would recommend the hotel to anyone heading into downtown Seattle for any reason.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16979083">My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for a Saturday night prior to leaving on an Alaska Cruise from the Port of Seattle. We had a Monaco King Room, and they have a program where you can adopt a goldfish for your stay. Our adoptive goldfish was named Belle. Belle was a charmer, very interactive for a fish, and we really missed her upon leaving. Check-In was fast and friendly, and after we had dropped off our bags we went back down and asked some directions from the front desk staff. They were very kind and gave us maps, suggestions, and directions to our specific query. The one little blip in our arrival was that we are Kimpton members and the specific little preferences that were supposed to be on tap for our room, were not in place. However, they later made up for it with a nice little fruit basket and mineral water. It is a beautifully done, elegant, smaller hotel, and I loved the reproduction Minoan frescoes, a la Knossos, in the reception area. There is definitely a â€˜personal touchâ€™ to the Hotel Monaco Seattle. The hotel is placed well, and we were able to walk to some nice downtown shopping areas and to the Pike Place Market, albeit nearly everything was closed by the time we made it down there. One negative, and it had nothing to do with the Hotel, were the swarms of homeless that approached one asking you to buy a 'paper'. Apparently Seattle deals with its homeless in a very humane manner and gives them identity badges and allows them to sell these newspapers. A unique approach to the problem, but it does get bothersome the fortieth time one is asked to 'buy a paper'. That and the rather seedy looking fellows lounging in a doorway, as we were getting near Pike Market, who were coveting my hub's camera - Seattle is beautiful architecturally so he was taking snaps like mad. However, I gave them my meanest - i.e. if looks could maim, ex-NYCer, ex-Chi-towner, ex-Miami, current LA Hollywood denizen glare and they backed off right quick. So, try not to look like a tourist in downtown Seattle, unless you are ready to thrash someone to a pulp if they try to jump you. Frankly, from my point of view, try not to look like a tourist anywhere! So, other than those two little blips, Seattle was fab, and the Hotel Monaco was AbFab! We had a nice large room, it was oddly shaped, but I do like things like that, and a huge window with a view up toward what I suppose are the hills. If one were of a voyeuristic bent, you could watch the life going on around one down on the street, and across the way in the residential buildings. The bathroom was large and spotless, with nice soft towels and L'Occitane products. There were some free sundries, and also a list of other sundries available for nominal prices. In the mini-bar were lots of choices, and these cute little stuffed goldfish that one can purchase. Yes, I got one and named her Belle, Too. In the closet were robes, camies and boxers in assorted sizes, and an umbrella that one could purchase, on the honour system. All in all, the items in the closet were a little on the pricey side - so I did not partake of any, but we got a good price on our room from my hubs corporate travel agency, so we ended up paying less by almost a c-note that we would have paid if we booked the room ourselves. The normal price of the room was comparable for others of the same class in the same area, but I liked the Monaco better because of the ambiance, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! Oh, and the bed, and pillows, were EVER so comfortable. I might even consider buying one from the Kimpton website sometime in the future. I had a wonderful sleep. The decor was nice and bright, but it had a modern classical empire sort of vibe, as well. There was free wifi, a definite plus, and I got to see other guests walking their pets, which always makes me happy. Although, it did make me miss my kitties. Also, there is a little shop on the main floor for sodas, emergency things if you need them, and they have souvenirs, too. There is an exercise room downstairs, but I didnâ€™t have time to use it. Although, it did look nice and clean. The next morning my hub's niece, who lives in Seattle, met us for breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Sazerac. The food was very tasty, mid-priced, and the staff very attentive. When I asked if the breakfast potatoes had onions in them - I am allergic to onions - they went to check, and then later when I didn't get the turkey sausage I ordered and I enquired about it, they said they had substituted it with ham because the turkey sausage had onion in it - ham had been my second choice. The waitress had remembered, and YES, she got quite a good tip for her attention to detail. Our niece, who had never been to the hotel before, told us that she would be coming back to Sazerac with her friends. The decor of Sazerac was lovely with all these wonderful free form glass fixtures, for which Seattle is famous, on the ceiling. The only possible cons about our hotel experience would be that the three elevators could be a little slow, and that there are only ice machines on a few floors, and of those two were broken. None of these problems were deal-breakers. When we visit Seattle again, and we will be going back, we will be staying at the Monaco again if they are available. It will be our first choice. Next time, I will ask if they have any rooms that one can see DOWN the hill from. I'd like a harbour view the next time. However, I did love the hill view, with all the lights glowing in the night. We LOVED our stay at the Monaco because of the ambiance, the people, the 'Green' feel, and of course, BELLE! We will be back, sometime in the near future, if at all possible<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16827338">My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding. We paid $300 for the suite with the jetted two-person jacuzzi tub. The hotel has a boutique feel - the rooms are decorated with a lot of stripes and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The room we had was huge but had a lot of empty space which was a little strange. The jacuzzi tub was huge and could definitely accommodate two people and was like a hot-tub. The only thing was that the hotel did not provide any bubble bath etc. which would seem normal when offering such a large tub. Parking was outrageous - $40 a night. We previously paid $19/night at the Residence Inn. We ended up parking for free overnight at a meter spot. Room service was fast but the selection was limited and the food was okay, not great. Overall, I didn't have any problems with Hotel Monaco - it just didn't seem worth the high price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16741202">Had a wonderful time at the Hotel Monaco. The location was excellent, a short stroll to the main downtown shopping area. Pet friendly but the room showed no signs of animal hair, smells, etc. We had a monaco suite and the sleeping area had big striped curtains which could be pulled closed, a nice touch which felt cosy. Had a goldfish named Brandi who we enjoyed. We didn't partake in the free wine or coffee/tea service in the lobby but thought it was a great feature. Great staff all around, very friendly. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel which worked in the suite on our 2 laptops. The decor was a lovely, eclectic mix of pattens in the same color palatte. Animal print bathrobes made us feel like rock stars. It was so nice to be somewhere that didn't look like a sterile chain hotel, this hotel had personality and we had an excellent stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16354733">I was here for 5 days/4 nights on a business trip and not having been to Seattle before, I didn't know quite what to expect. The hotel overall was a pleasant surprise. It is an older building that has obviously been substantially rennovated. I was in a room on 3rd floor facing the street but heard no traffic noise at all. The room was very well appointed and spacious. The service provided by staff was prompt and friendly, not intrusive or slow at any time. One minor exception was slow delivery of room service coffee one evening, the waiter said there would be no charge. Housekeeping was well done. I would definitely consider for another stay on a future visit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16181925">Just got back from our weekend at the Hotel Monaco Seattle. I did manage to read most of the recent reviews on Tripadvisor. Pros to this hotel: incredibly clean (and I'm a germaphobe so this means clean), hospitable staff, fun design, pet-friendly, and great products (L'Occitane) for guests to use. I truly enjoyed our stay, though I'm not sure the rate/night is enough bang for your buck, even in the Monte Carlo suite. We needed a weekend to relax and wanted a nice room with great room service. We accomplished both at the Hotel Monaco. The room service is impeccable and timely. My only issue besides the room rate is that the valet lost my friend's car and it took them 40 minutes to find it...and they only found it because she went looking for it herself. I read the reviews where some guests had issues with noise, but we did not. Very, very enjoyable and relaxing. Next time, we'll take advantage of some of the spa services.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR15350354">Spent the evening of April 22nd, Tuesday. Read all the Trip Advisor reviews before I visited the Hotel Monaco Seattle and was most worried about street noise. Stayed on the the 7th floor facing the busy city street, but heard very faint, almost no vehicle noise which I was relieved. The hotel is located in the center of a big busy vibrant city, and I expect to hear a little normal street life noise, but thankfully there was not a noise problem. Besides the very cool gym, I also enjoyed the complimentary yoga equipment in my room with the video fitness workouts on TV. Loved the fun animal print bathrobes and cool toiletries and the offer of their trademark pet goldfish during my stay. Hotel staff was always friendly, from the housekeepers to Art and Amanda at the concierge &amp; front desks were always smiling and very helpful. The doormen/valets always with a warm welcome as they opened the doors as guests enter the lobby. Evening complimentary wine and beer hour from 5-6pm nightly, and morning coffee in the lobby was a treat. Complimentary Wi-FI in rooms and lobby was another added touch of value. As principle, I get tired of being nickled and dimed by the big hotel chains. I am glad I can honestly recommend the Hotel Monaco.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15055966">April 10, 2008, this was the last stay of a college trip and wanted to splurge and relax. Booked because of the reviews read, disappointed because it was much less than i expected. the staff nice, but room small and overlooked the alley and a brick wall. Wish the clerk had told me the doubles overlooked the alley, $300. (includes tax and valet parking, one day) is too much, robes and a flat screen are not enough, nor the offers of a goldfish in a bowl. Will stay at another hotel next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14938649">The location to most of the downtown touristy spots was great. Easy walk to Pike Place. The hotel was decorated very nicely and the room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom amenities were top notch and the robes were a nice touch. The concierge (not Art) was not helpful when we inquired about local Seattle restaurants and the next day, when he still had not responded to us, he saw us in the lobby and quickly walked the other way to avoid us. The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The goldfish pet for the weekend was fun to have, and we had a goldfish couple. The hotel did send up a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne our first day which was unexpected and very thoughtful. Huge drawback was the noise from 4th street. We were on the 10th floor and the sound of the street, especially the buses, was incredible. The windows don't open so it would be smart of them to just invest in some double-paned windows. Walk just two blocks to McCormicks Bar and Grille (of McCormicks &amp; Schmicks) and they have an amazing happy hour with $1.95 appetizers (after 10 pm). It's and incredible deal for high-end steak house food.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR14562502">I stayed in a Queen/Queen room with 3 other people. We all agreed that our room looked much nicer, brighter, funkier, warmer online than it did in person. In reality it was dark, and not sure what was going on with the decor- it was very tacky, and not the type of room i felt like hanging out it all day. I felt the bed was comfortable, but my friends felt it was far too soft. The person at the front desk when we first arrived was not very helpful. She was rather snobby and we felt like we were an inconvenience every time we asked her a question. On the plus side, the lobby was very nice. The complimentary happy hour every night between 5-6 was also a great bonus. The bellboy and valet were very friendly and quite helpful when we asked for suggestions on where to eat. And overall the hotel was very clean, which is a must for me. It was an okay stay. But i probably wouldn't stay there again, mostly because the room is not what I expected and though it was decent and clean, I guess it's not what I was looking for.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14037261">Another pet friendly hotel. They even have a resident hotel dog. We had a corner room which was large and well appointed. I love the funky chic decor. Comfortable reading chaise and lamp. The windows in our bathroom were huge! The had sliding shutters to block out any viewing! It was Christmas time and they had a beautiful tree in the lobby and gingerbread house made by the staff. It lent itself to the holiday spirit while we enjoyed the complimentary wine and champagne tasting. (Try not to miss it...they even have beer and non-acoholic drinks) I would pick this hotel over Hotel Vintage Park because they do have a small workout room. Some of the equipment didn't work...my only complaint...and nothing to wipe the equipment with either.<topic>none</topic>

The room was not particularly large, but it was fine for our needs. The bathroom was all inclusive. It was all very luxurious except that the bathroom sink was very slow-draining. You have turn-down service, fun colorful bathrobes and the NY Times in the morning. There is a coffee maker but the one in our room had a defect. It said "pause &amp; pour" but when I lifted the coffee pot it leaked all over which means the filter basket was missing the mechanism. The service was excellent from the valet to the bellman to the front desk people. You do not park your car in their lot, the only choice you have is to use the valet. It is about $30/day charge for the parking lot which is added to your bill and of course you tip the people each time they get your car so we only took the car out once to go to the Space Needle Restaurant. We walked to Pike Place Market and other places in the area. Bring good walking shoes and be prepared for hills. There is an Hour of Indulgence in the lobby from 5 to 6 p.m. but I really feel the word "indulgence" should be removed and they should just call it Happy Hour. They had one red wine, one white wine, one type of soda and absolutely nothing to eat. No snack to go with the drinks. I asked a woman who was pouring drinks if there was anything like peanuts -- anything at all and she said "no, but that sounds like a good idea". I'm sure they have people ask all the time even though she acted like I was the first person who ever inquired. For such a fancy hotel, I was really surprised and wondered why they used the word "indulgence". I have stayed at Inn Suites hotels where they have a happy hour with drinks and popcorn so you would think a Kimpton hotel would have some kind of snack. This is a pet-friendly hotel which was so surprising to me. I guess it just seems too elegant for that but I will say it was very clean and I never got the slightest hint of pet odors. There is a restaurant in this hotel, but we did not eat there so I can't comment on that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR13055511">My husband and I stayed in this hotel on a crazy weekend when we were attending a memorial service for my best friend's husband, and we were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary. Talk about mixed emotions. We booked a suite and the hotel put us in the Monte Carlos one. We were loaned a beautiful fan-tanned goldfish named Joliet for the weekend, and we visited with the three dogs who worked the front desk, along with their human companions. The room was decorated nicely (though the couch could have used a few pillows). The L'Occitane bath amenities are always a welcome sight. The room was quiet and peaceful. The wireless Internet access was wonderful until the server went down the morning we were leaving so we had some problems printing our boarding passes. The afternoon reception serves oenophile-satisfying wine from Australia and scrumptious cookies. The restaurant was closed for renovation for a part of our stay but when we finally ate there, the food was good and the drinks were even better. One word of caution on the restaurant: if you are a larger person, do not sit at the booths because you won't fit. I'm 5'6" and 125 lbs; my husband is 5'9" and 175. The table was smack-against his stomach; and though I had a couple of inches space, it would be mighty uncomfortable if the patron is any larger or pregnant. Bad design, in my opinion, though the place is decorated in a funky and welcoming way with metal and wood, and handblown glass light fixtures that you'd expect in Seattle, the capital of the US glass art industry. We'd definitely stay here again for any reason.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12828096">We booked our room on Seattle SuperSaver's site, since our normal Seattle Hotel was booked solid. What a treat---and we may have a new favorite hotel in Seattle. Staff: Fabulous, friendly and Helpful! Room: Spacious, light, roomy, clean and very comfortable. Goldfish: The true delight of my daughter. The 5 pm reception in the Lobby: Warm, inviting--usually I hate those receptions where strangers all get together---but this was nice---light--not pretentious. Location: Perfect for exploring Seattle. We loved it and will definetly return!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12771025">My husband and I spent 7 nights at the Monaco in early January, 2008. Business trip for him - my chance to come along for the ride. We booked a Monte Carlo Suite which proved more than comfortable for our longish stay. We were in room 905 which is located on the street side of the building. Street noise was not a problem and the view had to be more interesting than that of rooms on the back of the building which look out at a dank alley and the midsection of a large office building. The suite was very comfortable with plenty of room to spread out. The bathroom was attractive and squeaky clean, but rather small in comparison to the generous proportions of the sitting and sleeping areas. Lots of comfortable seating options, good lighting and plenty of storage for clothing and luggage. Hotel staff were very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were more than pleasant. All requests were responded to quickly. The location is quite good. An easy walk to Pike Street Market, Seattle Art Museum (which is top notch) and many shopping and dining options. A very positive experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR11988133">I have stayed at about 3 of the Moncao branded hotels. The Seattle version is the least ornate out of all I have stayed at, but it still a beautiful hotel. We stayed 2 nights, and I had gotten a suite with a whirlpool tub to relax. Our A/C stopped working and we had to be moved to another room. Beware if you get a room with an alley view as the garbage trucks WILL wake you no matter what floor your are on. The glass was not soundproof as it was touted. Staff was friendly and helpful, the valets were quick to get our vehicle parked at their offsite garage. The beds are definatly made for sleeping. Very soft and plush, and the minifridges and snack cabinets have everything you could want. I have to say that the rooms do feel quite bland compared to their sister-hotels. I felt as if the room should have cost me about 50-60% of what it did. Overall, I don't think I would stay at this particular hotel again, but I will continue to stay at Monacos. I sure love those goldfish. :)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11934355">I quite like the Monaco. It has a good, but not completely central position in Seattle. It's a short walk (in a European way) to the centre. The common areas are smallish, but the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Bar is part of a popular restaurant so not intimate but does the job nonetheless. The room was good, the decor a little gaudy but if you like an individual style that will suit. The room was not huge but adequate and had most amenities. All in all a pretty good choice in Seattle<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11503900">A quality hotel chocked full of staff that make you feel at home. We experienced exceptional service from the front desk staff, the concierge and the door men, however the maid service needs some work. We found that our maid failed to tuck in our sheets at the foot of the bed and on one instance soiled sheets were used. The staff quickley resolved the soiled sheets issue. My guess this relates to one employee and is not a reflection on the rest of the staff. We received excellent advice from the concierge regarding resturants in the area, the happy hour wine tasting was a nice touch and the staff went out of their way to make you feel at home. Great location if you like to be close to good food and shopping, we took in a play at the 5th street theather as well. Pikes Market, Pioneer Square and access to the mono rail is within short walking distance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11248988">My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. The hotel is fantastic. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. A fun quirk - they will put a goldfish in your room if you like. The management is very responsive. During our second night, the people in the room next to us were extremely loud. When I told the manager this in the morning, I was immediately given 1/2 off the night's stay and moved to suite at no additional cost. The hotel location is ideal, within walking distance of the fishmarket, shops, bars and restaurants. I highly recommend staying here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10782933">I have actually stayed at this hotel twice for a total of about two weeks. I enjoyed the downtown location and great room. However, if I had paid for a hotel myself, I wouldn't have splurged on it. I don't recall the exact rate, but it was around $300 per night. OUCH! The staff were friendly, but have their hand out for tips at every juncture. Valet parking is for the birds. Give me a parking lot and I'll get my own car, especially if I have to come and go more than once per day. Bottom line: If you have disposable income, this hotel is a place where you can feel pampered, but I'll stick to other options.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10689506">I stayed at the Hotel Monaco Seattle during a conference for work. I otherwise probably would not have been able to stay there for four nights (it isn't cheap), but with work paying for it, I got to splurge a little. When I arrived the first night, it was just in time for their nightly wine happy hour. The woman at the desk let me know there were 10 minutes left and that I might want to swing through there before going to my room to get a couple glasses to take up with me. Yes indeed! The room was lovely; not as big or as posh as pictured, but I also hadn't reserved a suite. The bed was fantastic. Comfy, plush, great bedding. The room had its own temperature controls, so I was able to keep it a little on the cool side, which I prefer. The bathroom was clean and nice. They have L'Occitaine products, which I love, so that was a bonus. They have an ironing board, iron, and hairdryer in each room and many things you can request from the front. But the biggest bonus was the staff. Every single person was friendly, helpful, and genuine. I needed to receive and send a fax ... no problem (and no charge). I ordered room service one day ($28, ouch!), and the waiter was great. The doormen were consistently friendly. The desk staff was exceptional. Makes me wish I could afford to splurge on hotels like this on my own every once in a while!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10210048">We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night on our way to Victoria. Front desk staff was very helpful, valets and bellman also helpful. Stayed in a Monaco Suite, nice size room but we did hear neighbors on one side of us, and we did hear everything!!!! We were there with our beagle and they treated all three of us well. Enjoyed the afternoon wine and meeting other guests. Easy walk to most Seattle sites for us. We knew about the valet only parking ahead of time so were not surprised by it, would be nice to have a good self park option. We would stay there again for the same price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10037744">After a wonderful Alaskan cruise, I stayed on in Seattle at the Hotel Monaco for 3 nights. The hotel is a lovely property and the location is ideally suited for those visitors who enjoy walking around a city to see more than just the tourist attractions. The decor is quite different and colorful as compared to most other chain hotels, but I liked that very much. One can only stand so much beige, blue and green. Some might consider the decor "busy" but I found it quite refreshing. The new Seattle Library, which is a spectacular ultra contemporary building, is directly across the street and one block down. The Seattle Art Museum and the Aquarium are within walking distance and are worth the time and effort. The things I found most disappointing about the property were the housekeeping services and the attached restaurant, Sazarec. Housekeeping service was polite but very slow. Also, the ice machines are located on every other floor starting on the fourth floor. I had a suite on the 3rd floor and although it wasn't a hardship, it wasn't convenient either. The food in the restaurant was excellent quality but overpriced and my waiter seemed tired and/or not interested in making my dining experience a memorable one. After all the really wonderful reviews I read about the Monaco, I found my stay there not as pleasant as I had expected. I do like Kimpton properties and I would stay in one again if I were to go back to Seattle, but I probably choose one of the other two properties there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10002985">I had stayed there as a part of the week-long conference program. I would say the location is not the best in terms of access limited by traffic during rush hours, but this is something beyond their control for now. The hotel provided an excellent example of what an ideal value for money was. The staff was excellent, they took care of everything before our arrival. The service was prompt and did everything to make us comfortable. Food was exceptional, too. Of course, the rates might be on a little higher side, and I might not have stayed at this place if I had to pay for myself. But for business travelers and for those who want access to everything within 10 minutes of walk, this is an ideal place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8724369">Nice hotel, but nothing really special. The room decor is hideous. Room is very dark and not enough natural light comes through the window, and there are simply too many colors. It was very hard to get comfortable in a room that I felt like was screaming at me. Pink and white candy striped wallpaper should be outlawed. Too many wall hangings and too many disjointed colors. Purple vases didn't match anything in the room and made me feel like I was at Mardi Gras. The pink, yellow, grey and green floral-and-ivy animal scene patterned chair is ugly, ugly, ugly. A simple wood bed would have been a better choice instead of the sky-blue and gold painted headboard I was given. Room, hotel, and restaurant are very clean. Staff is super friendly and very attentive. Flat screen tv is quite nice. Bathroom has marble counters and fixtures and floor look very clean and fresh. Wine bar from 5-6 is nice, but I was in Seattle for work, so it was hard to get to the hotel during this super-short happy hour that literally lasted exactly one hour. Overall, an average experience, but the W and Fairmont hotels across the street will give a nicer room, in the same location, for comparable prices.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8718266">We were in Seattle September 5-9th and had a heck of time finding a hotel. Apparently UW, Boise State, WSU and San Diego Street were in town for football games and brought their entire schools with them! Rates were higher than we had hoped for that weekend (should have come over Labor Day, rates were much cheaper) but the Hotel Monaco was worth it. Be sure to check the event calendar of the city as rates fluctuate dramatically. We booked a Monte Carlo suite as that was the only room available and it was fantastic for a four night stay. The extra sitting area was more like a funky living room than hotel room. There were curtains that partitioned the bed from the living room but I think they were decoration only (would have been cool if they really closed). The room has bold striped wall paper and a very spacious bathroom. What really made the stay was the staff, they were amazing! I was worried at first because they seemed so young but they were most attentive. The property is small enough that they get to know you and are always trying to help you out. Location was good, all hotels that we considerd seemed to be in a 5 block radius so I can't say anyone really has an advantage. We walked everywhere. Highly recommended!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8703821">We booked a 2 night stay at the Monaco prior to our Alaska cruise on the Noordam. We thought we had stayed there a few years ago since the photos of the rooms looked right, but turned out we had been at a sister property, the Vintage Park. Not a problem--we have discovered another delightful property owned by Kimpton. The downtown location is convenient to Pike Place Market, the waterfront area, Pioneer Square, and Nordstrom's flagship store. Starbucks is adjacent. The front desk staff was welcoming; the concierge dropped everything to book us a tour; the bell staff was very friendly and most efficient. Rooms are compact, but very well appointed and decorated. Good bed, bedside tables, plenty of space for our cruising luggage, good lighting, flat screen TV, and a very nice clean bathroom with L'occitane toiletries and makeup mirror. We also found magazines, a nice big umbrella,( which we used only briefly-sunny weekend overall) and, my favorite perk, leopard print terry robes! We liked the newspapers--WSJ, NYT and local Seattle-- and the am coffee. If you are lonely, the hotel will provide a goldfish to keep you company. Don't miss the evening reception where complimentary Washington wines and local brews can be sampled while meeting other guests of the hotel (and possibly their pets!) The Hotel Monaco is a very nice downtown hotel with a laidback Seattle personality-we really enjoyed it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8696980">This is the second time my husband and I have stayed at a Monaco hotel. The first was earlier in the same trip when in Portland, OR. The staff, from the front desk and concierge to the porters and valets, were friendly and helpful from the minute we stepped in the door and throughout our two-night stay. We happily got upgraded to a King room this time around, which gave us some extra space. The parking was a bit exorbitant (I think $29/night as in Portland), but the valet service was impeccable and friendly. It was slightly disappointing that breakfast wasn't included, but the food in the attached Sazerac was quite good. We had two wonderful but different meals while in Seattle. The first night was at the Purple Cafe and Wine Bar, which someone told us was fairly new. We ordered a great mix of tapas (ah, to have those goat cheese and pine nut-stuffed dates again) and desserts. The second night was at Lampreia. If you don't like nouvelle cuisine or lots of attention, you won't like it, but the food itself made up for small and unusual presentations and slightly smothering service.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8519111">Stayed at Hotel Monaco Seattle for 2 nts. during the past weekend. We travelled with our son &amp; our 2 dogs (they're both small dogs, a Pom. &amp; a Papillon). Chose this hotel mainly because it's a pet-friendly hotel which didn't charge extra for our dogs, &amp; allowed the dogs to stay in the room unsupervised. We got into problem the first nt. We had dinner at Rover's, which was less than 10 mins.' drive from the Hotel. Dinner took much longer time than expected (fr. 6:15 p.m. to 9:15 p.m.). We rec'd 2 phone calls fr. the hotel complaining too much barking from our dogs. When we returned, we actually saw our neighbour moving out, but we did not hear any barking outside our room. We moved our dogs to the other side of the room farthest away from the door. When we left our room the following day, we left our TV on so that our dogs would not be able to hear noises outside our room so easily. We also delayed the cleaning of our room to mid-afternoon when we went sight-seeing with our dogs. Our plan worked, and we rec'd no more complaints. The hotel staff were friendly in general. The wine-reception was fr. 5 - 6 p.m. Only white &amp; red wine, lemonade &amp; water were served. It wasn't very busy when we went there at 5:15, although all tables were occupied. We didn't bother going again the following day. Amenities were L'Occitane as advertisied, which included shower cap, soap, shampoo, condition &amp; lotion. We asked for toothbrushes (I expected L'Occitane's but they brought Colgate's) &amp; slippers, but housekeeping did not bring toothpaste along. We didn't bother to ask again and decided to buy our own in the Pharmacy near the hotel. The animal-print bath-robe was fun for photo-taking purpose. We joined the hotel's "In-Touch Loyalty Program". Housekeeping left voice-message saying the hotel has amenity kit for each of us &amp; asked us to call back. When we called, they brought us one bottle of Evian &amp; a small pack of chocolate, but NOT for each of us though. The hotel has price-matching policy. They will honour any lower rate available from other web-site. In general, an above-average pet-friendly hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8489946">We stayed at The Hotel Monaco after our cruise. The rooms were very generous and decorated uniquely. The hotel, a remodeled Pacific Bell building, had charm and a sturdiness about it. Everytime we walked by the bell men, we felt like we were coming home. Very secure. Great for single travelers! The location is fabulous. Walk to most things, Pike market, even the space needle. Little grocery/drug store a block away. Was on Today show about being Green! Bravo. We had 1 double bed room and one room with bed and couch separated by a curtain. My( snoring) mom slept there,behind the curtain. Great food there and nearby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8364028">Stayed at the Monaco in Seattle this July. A nice hotel, if it were priced at $100-$150 per night, but it's not. The hotel takes a beating on the 'value' quotient. The whole experience was simply average. Nothing exceptional, and if you're paying $300+, I don't see how you can't be terribly disappointed. My wife and I stayed in their nicest "suites" for less than $200/night, and felt like we were almost overpaying. The best advice I can give is to shop around. Quality-wise, it's in a league with your average Marriott or a nice Best Western.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8002323">We arrived just before the cruise season began, so the whole city was less crowded than usual, and so was the hotel. We arrived very late from the airport to the hotel, and they gave us an upgraded room just because it was available....We were travelling with our son and were exhausted, so we really appreciated it. The hotel is very pet friendly, but so clean that you wouldn't know it. They apparently cater to any size pet, which is unusual for such a nice hotel, and if you don't have your own, they offer you your own pet fish! Nice touch, especially for our 8 year old son. The upgraded room has a dividing curtain and it's beautiful. Two flat screen televisions, not that you need them, but they're there. Fun tiger print robes and beds that are ohhh so comfortable. The food is delicious, and the chef gives demonstrations too. I can't remember ever enjoying being in a hotel so much that I didn't want to step outside, but that's exactly how I felt at Hotel Monaco. If you prefer something extraordinary, then try Hotel Monaco....It is NOT your typical luxury hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7803841">Stayed here 4 nights in late May 2007. Looked for a comparable Hilton, Marriott, Westin in the area for the points/miles, but I couldn't find anything so I gave the Monaco a shot. Was pleasantly surprised -- everything was very nice -- room service was quick and tasty, bed was especially comfortable, and unlike some people here I have nothing but positive things to say about the service. Only downside would be the relatively small exercise room (only one treadmill), but heck I was still on east coast time and ran into only one person down there at 5 AM during the four days. Would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7729260">This hotel is a Kimpton, so the design is whimsical and the vibe is fun. The staff is young and casual, and I can see how this can be a problem when the hotel is busy, but during my stay they were friendly and helpful. My group reserved two rooms, and they gave us connecting rooms without a fuss. It was not a busy week. The rooms are a decent size, not huge but pretty average for a city hotel. The beds are nice and the bathrooms are clean and bright, though the pocket doors are less than ideal for a busy bathroom. The room design is bright and cheery, and there's a flat panel TV. The location can get a little noisy, but I was fine on the 5th floor. The location is convenient and walkable to attractions such as the new central library, SAM (the art museum), Benaroya Concert Hall, and Pike Place Market. Parking is steep at $29/night. The evening wine receptions were very popular.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7723039">My husband and I traveled with our dog to Seattle for a wedding over the Memorial Day weekend. We wanted a better than average hotel with a central location to fit in a little sightseeing and it needed to be dog-friendly. The Hotel Monaco on 4th Avenue met all our needs perfectly. From the time we checked in to the time of our departure, the hotel staff answered all our questions, spoiled our dog, and took the time to get to know us. We loved the complimentary wine and beer in the lobby lounge every afternoon (5 - 6 pm) as it gave us a chance to relax, chat with the staff serving, and mingle with some of the other hotel guests. The rooms were decorated with a whimsical feel and the typical white terrycloth robes were anything but, each one a different animal print! The bathroom was a generous size, clean, modern, and the complimentary toiletries were by L'Occitane. The bed was comfy and covered with a duvet. The room was spacious with a chair and light for reading, in addition to a desk for catching up on some writing or for some work on the computer. We would highly recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Seattle for business or pleasure. Hotel Monaco is part of the Kimpton Hotel group and their website is ---<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7720630">We checked into Hotel Monaco on Thursday, May 24th. Drove up to valet and was immediately attended to. Check in was fast and easy. The front desk staff was nice and friendly. We were given a room on the 9th floor, I requested a higher room and not to be on the "pet" floor, days prior. Our room was nice, clean and HOT. The thermostat was at 78 degrees. We adjusted the setting and nothing worked. We called the front desk and they had some one up in 10 minutes to check. He said he fixed it and my party went downstairs to take in the free wine/beer tasting. (very good and they give you a nice size pour on the wine) I went back to the room to see if it was it had cooled down, it had not. I went to the front desk to see what else they can do. They gave me two options, they can send someone else to fix it again or give me a new room. I decided to not take my chances and get a new room. I asked the front desk manager, since it's an inconvenience pack up and move to a different room if there was any form of compensation they could give us. The hotel comp'd our parking ($31.00) I was satisfied with that. Our new room was COOL and had a working fan. This was my first visit to a Kimpton Hotel and overall I was pleased. What I liked: The beds The cool bath robes The TV The in room shampoo/conditioner/lotion The Goldfish sent to your room The location - smack dab in the middle of downtown shopping/restaurants/pike st. market and pioneer square/stadiums. All within walking distance. What I didn't like: The iron - it kept leaking water and didn't work. The bathroom - no fan<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7594768">I have to echo what others said about the hotel. The staff at the front desk is very rude and very snotty - very brusque in dealing with their guests. It also takes a while for your car to get picked up by the valets so if in a rush, allow for some time. In terms of security thought, only floors 10 and 11 require key access. So request a room on that floor. On the plus side, the hotel has a great location in the heart of downtown. I also like the fact that they have a comfortable bed (down comforters) and instead of curtains, they have shutters in the room. Another hint is to request a non-pet room unless you want to stay in a room where other animals have stayed in before. Overall, I would not recommend the hotel unless you get a good rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7418609">-Big plus - Internet access with cable, not just wifi, is free in the room. If you have problems connecting (e.g., work VPN), you can press a button on your phone and immediately be connected with an internet specialist that will assist you. -I found a better rate with the hotel after booking with Quikbook, and the hotel updated the rate without me having to go back to Quikbook to cancel. -Goldfish is only available upon request, not automatically waiting for you in your room. So don't forget to ask if you want one. -Concierge and front desk were especially friendly and pleasant, I thought, and not the typical attitude you find with a concierge of a comparable or even fancier hotel, say across the street. -Only downside is the sound-proofing, the hotel was quiet for the most part, but I could hear my neighbor through the wall occasionally. -Another downside is there is no bellhop waiting for you when you arrive. This is the type of hotel where you will drag your own bags into the lobby. I was annoyed that after I had retrieved my bags from storage and dragged them most of the way out to the taxi, then the bellhop offered to help, as if I was going to tip for that last-second, too-late help.<topic>none</topic>

The worst part was the desk clerk checking out.... tap tap tap on the computer as my car waited out side to pick me up for almost 20 minutes. When I got home I also noticed the 1,000 dollar hold they put on my credit card that took 5 phonecalls, 2 faxes and 1 week to get resolved.

<comment category="positive" id="UR6833791">We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 2 nights over MLK weekend. We loved the decor, the plush animal robes (nice to have, but not so soft), the flat screen TV, in-room Strabucks coffee with the coffee maker, and the Aveda bath amenities (the website now says they have L'Occitane amenities). We got a corner room, and the layout of the room isn't your typical rectangular shape, so it was nice. It was nice to have lots of sitting space next to the wide wall-to-wall window. We also loved the plantation shutters along the windows, but there are gaps that let in a lot of light. It was bright in the morning. An extra layer of curtains would help a lot. I called a few days before checking in to request a goldfish for our room. There was no goldfish when we arrived. We asked for a goldfish the second day. Unfortunately, the fish was just about to die the next morning (most likely from lack of oxygen in the bowl). It put a sad note upon leaving this place. This is our first Kimpton Hotel experience. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. It didn't feel like a typical hotel. Will likely stay at another Kimpton hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6765615">Hotel Stay: February 3rd - 4th, 2007 My friend and I picked the Hotel Monaco because of its appealing website and online package which included champagne, late checkout at 3, free valet and a gift from the spa for the weekend. My friend checked into the room a few hours earlier and I came in later. When I pulled up to the valet, the young man just stood there. I asked him if the valet was open and he said it was. I had to pull my bags out, he didnâ€™t even offer to help. After I got my garment bag and suitcase, I came up to him to give the car key and room number; he says "I am not the valet". I had to put everything back into the car, park the car on the side of the street and pull everything out again. I left the key with who ever he was working there and asked him to have the "valet" park the car when he gets back. I went up to the room, everything seemed fine, the bottle of champagne was there, the oil and lotion gift from the spa. We dressed and went out, when we came back and got into bed, we noticed blood drops on both the pillows and on the sheets where the pillows were. I was so disgusted, this was just unbelievable. We called the desk and they sent somebody up almost 20 minutes later! He swapped our sheets out and left with out even apologizing. Sunday morning we called the front desk to speak to management about the sheets and they became very aggravated and rude with us. Apparently there was no manager or any kind of supervisor over the weekend and we had to wait until Monday morning. The young man we spoke to said that they would cover the food, adding that the person that changed the sheets said that it was fresh blood, in a very rude tone. Our checkout was at 3pm because of the package that we booked. From 12 to 1:30, three staff (maids) tried to walk into the room, and after opening the door apologizing and closing it. Two people called up saying that "check out was at 12" and I had to remind them of the package. I finally packed all my things up and went downstairs to check out. Quickly signed the paper and took off. When on the way, I took a closer look at the room bill. Unfortunately they never covered the food, which they had offered and we were charged for the valet. I called the front desk to ask about the charges, the lady that answered snapped back saying that they were aware of the problem we experienced and I should call back on Monday like they told us earlier. I have never in my life been treated like this at any hotel anywhere. I am not sure if this hotel constantly has problems or if we were the lucky ones, but I would never stay there again and never recommend it to anybody I know.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6584201">What a fun hotel! The room was small but funky and very cozy. I requested and had delivered a pet fish, named Pooler. It was a beautiful bowl and fun to have. The daily paper delivered to my door was the NYTimes, a plus being a New Yorker. The honor bar was well stocked and the room service was a little pricey but prompt. On the last night I finally got a chance to partake in the complimentary wine hour which included a fortune telling. Overall this is the most fun I've had in a hotel in a while. I will definitely try to book Kimpton hotels in the future.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6485616">We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at Hotel Monaco. We were attending a concert at nearby Benoroya Hall and found this hotel to be an excellent place to spend the night. Check in was smooth and we loved our room with the striped wall paper and Sunshine, our pet fish. We made reservations at the hotel restuarant and had a delightful meal with an attentive waiter. (Try the catfish, it's delicious!) We'll choose this hotel next time we stay in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6314122">Have now stayed at the Hotel Monaco twice for a total of 5 nights. Overally, I've been very pleased. Checkin and checkout are easy and I've never had to wait in line. I've stayed in both a suite and the basic king room. The suite is essentially a very large room separated by a curtain. The sitting room has a couch and additional flat screen TV. Unless you're traveling with more than 2 people or want to spend a lot of time in your room, the standard room is more than adequate. Suite bath is pretty much the same as a regular room (they do have suites with jacuzzis that might be more elaborate). Hotel is only 11 floors so don't expect panoramic views. Furnishings are "funky" but tasteful. Rooms appear to be in good repair. Robes (with animal print) are standard. Large flat screen TVs with many, many channels are standard. Bathroom amenities (Aveda) are replenished daily. Bathrooms are modern with tile floors and granite counters. I've had mixed room service experiences. Twice, it was fast and food (pizza) was excellent. One morning breakfast was late and cold. The soft-boiled eggs were hard, which is good because they didn't provide a spoon. The attached restaurant is okay, but the one time we tried it service was very slow. Have heard that it's good for lunch/dinner but the menu wasn't that appealing to me so didn't try it. The concierge was helpful but was rarely seen before 9 or after 5. However, the front desk personnel were great. Wake up calls came promptly. There is free wireless and wired interet access as well as a computer in the lobby for those who didn't bring their own. There are some additional nice touches. First, they host a "wine hour" from 5-6 each evening. Wine is decent (and free) and they do refill your glass. It's a nice way to unwind and mingle with colleagues or even strangers. They are also very pet friendly -- actually seem to enjoy pets rather than merely "accepting" them. For example, this huge dog joined the wine hour and started to wander off into the restaurant. The staff didn't panic -- merely quietly alerted the owner who rectified the situation. The location is good -- walking distance to a lot of things. However, the hotel is on a San-Francisco type hill, so if you walk down to Pike Market, it's a VERY steep walk back up. The one nice thing about this hotel is that it caters to a variety of traveler types. We saw Packers' fans (in town for the NFL game), business people, tourists, etc. A nice mix with nice staff. It is a pleasant change from the traditional loud, impersonal hotels you find in so many large cities. Would definitely recommend it and stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6111995">The Seattle Hotel Monaco holds up the high standards of the Kimpton hotel line. Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in several other cities, I can easily say that the Seattle Hotel Monaco is one of the best I have seen. The service is attentive and very prompt. Based on being a member of the Kimpton loyalty program, I was upgraded to a 10th floor room with a great view of 4th street and the excellent public library kitty-corner across from the hotel. I highly recommend a tour of the public library; you will be blown away. My room is quite spacious, with a beautiful flat-screen television, with DVD/CD player. The exercise room is pretty standard Kimpton size, which means adequate but not outstanding: four eliptical cardio machines and two stationary bikes, each with personal viewing screens. The cardio machine screens accept DVD's, which I have not seen elsewhere. As with all Kimpton hotels, and the Hotel Monaco line in particular, the hotel's lobby is stylish, quirky, and inviting. It's easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable, over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel, Sazerac, is very good. So far, I have eaten lunch there and look forward to breakfast tomorrow. As always with Kimpton properties, I am able to connect to the free highspeed internet by ethernet in seconds, and am cruising the web and checking email back at the office with no problems. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with any Kimpton hotel, and the Seattle Hotel Monaco is certainly an excellent choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6030885">We had to make some last minute travel arrangements in Seattle. Since we were travelling with a dog , a Google search of dog friendly hotels in Seattle popped up numerous choices, including this one. Since the location, the room sizes available (2 adults, 2 small kids and a large dog) and their pet friendly policies suited us (and the positive reviews on Tripadvisor), we booked. On arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff all of whom took great interest in making our stay comfortable. The hotel is nicely decorated and the king suite room very comfortable for all of us, especially with the drapery partition between the two rooms. Most notable was the attentiveness to our dog. While many places bill themselves as "pet friendly", most are no more than "pet tolerant". Not here. Our dog was welcomed by every staff member she came across. Even better was their offer to keep her at the front desk while we went for breakfast. They actually kept right at the desk like a junior front desk clerk rather than sequestering her away in a kennel. An extra service we were not exepecting. Of course, it we not just their treatment of our dog that meant our stay pleasant. It was a nicely personal hotel without its own style and very distinct from the chains. I am now a committed Kimpton hotel user and will stay whenever I can (with dog or without). We didnâ€™t make it to the wine hour this time, but will be sure to do so on our next visit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5986139">Being a Kimpton customer expected to find a better place. We had reserved a suite which turned out to be a large room separated with a tacky curtain as a division. The TV control remote didn't work. Wireless internet connection didnt work either. We paid $46 for two coffees and bagel room service breakfast, which arrived 30 minutes late. On our departure date, having to catch an early flight, we had requested room service at 6,00am and after several calls it finally arrived at 6,45am.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5898970">This hotel came highly recommended by my travel agent, therefore I had high expectations. The hotel was very comfortable and staffed by nice people. The location is great. You can walk to several wonderful restaurants, Pike Place market, and the convention center. I traveled to Seattle for business. I paid $161 for my room. I'm not sure how I got such a great deal. My colleague was supposed to pay $260. Our travel agent had made a mistake on his check-in date. At many hotels, he would have been penalized for arriving a day late, but when he pointed out the mistake and change of rate to the front desk staff, she immediately changed the rate back without hesitation. The concierge was very helpful in recommending some great restaurants and an affordable spa. One thing to remember though is that he leaves at 6 every night. My room didn't have much of a view. My view was of the street in front of the hotel. The hotel is in a building shorter than the surrounding buildings. My colleague had a better view down a street. The room was not huge, but it was spacious. The bathroom was very spacious. Everything was extremely clean. The free high speed internet was reliable. The bed was comfortable, but I do not like feather pillows, and that was all they offered. The climate control worked very well. The hotel is decorated brightly. The large (32"?) flat screen TV with many channels is a nice bonus. The room and hallway had a musty smell, but I got over that quickly. Aveda bath products are a nice touch. Turn down service is standard and does not have to be requested. They will deliver a pet goldfish to your room if requested. It was nice to come home to and wake up to an animal since I missed my dogs. My one suggestion for improvement is the workout room. It is very small. There is nothing worse than being in a cramped little space with a bunch of other people trying to work out. This room has one treadmill, 2 elliptical machines, 3 stationary bikes, 1 stairmaster, 2 benches and 1 set of free weights. The third day I went in, the 5 lb dumbells were gone. The cardio machines have personal entertainment centers better than any others I have seen. There is a nightly reception from 5-6 pm with free wine and free coffee in the morning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5814809">Just stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Seattle on 9/12. Very nice quiet corner room (I'm part of Kimpton's Loyalty program, and that is my preferred room type). No view to speak of (looked into an office building), but a very comfy bed, good desk space, window seats, and a huge bathroom. Great perk was the 3 bathrobes hanging in the closet (a long robe made for a LARGE man, and 2 shorter robes more suited for women). Had a great room service experience....food arrived in 20 minutes, and was one of the best chicken sandwiches ever (soaked in lemon juice, and served on a great Ciabatta roll with pesto aioli). Check out was super efficient, and they asked straight away if I needed transportation. When I said I needed a cab to another hotel, they immediately called out to the bellman to have a cab waiting for me, while they completed my check out. A very nice touch. The price of the hotel was my only issue.....everything in Seattle was very expensive for this time period due to a big Microsoft convention and Cruise travelers. All in all, very pleasant stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5731581">Spent 4 nights here in late August 2006 to celebrate our anniversary. Would definitely stay here again. Service was efficient and friendly. We had a little glitch on check in (needed a roll in shower for spouse who uses wheelchair, and front desk person didn't realize that the accessible rooms had different features) but it was rectified quickly. Our room was lovely and sparkling clean. Valet parking guys were friendly and pretty quick. Evening wine hour was nice and well attended. Loved seeing the board with the names of the "dogs in residence." Since we didn't have ours, we asked for a fish, and we named him/her after our dog Buster. Nice touch. Adjacent restaurant Sazerac was great for breakfast, dinner, and cocktails. Location is good - a little tricky for the wheelchair as it is downtown and its hard to get down to the water due to the grades. No outdoor space to speak of, which usually wouldn't matter but since we had great weather it would have been nice to have a patio somewhere. Still, highly recommend for business or pleasure travelers.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5628877">Needed a quick, relaxing get-away. I booked a suite here because I really like the Kimpton hotels and knew I could bring my dog and also get in-room spa treatments. I chose the Mediterranean Suite w/ jacuzzi tub (@ $329 a night). I had high expectations and they were dashed pretty quickly. At check-in, no one offered to help with luggage. I struggled up to my third floor suite, which was pretty dark (only one window in the room and that faces a building) and had stained carpet (large reddish stains... possible crime scene?). There was no room service menu and the ethernet cable in the room was broken and didn't work (there is wireless). The fitness center is not acceptable for a hotel in this price range and reputation. It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is "out of order". You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express. The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well. Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants). In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty "floaters" were in evidence. This was an OK stay. But several new boutique hotels have recently opened in Seattle that offer more in terms of service and attention to detail. The Monaco is going to have to improve if they hope to compete.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5624914">This is a very nice hotel. However, when I am paying top dollar, I expect top service. Nothing happened that wasn't "just life", but I expected a little more supervision....like...my alarm clock went off twice in the middle of the night...I had not set it...the 2nd time I couldn't get it to quiet, so I unplugged it, but then lost my middle of the night timepiece...I would have expected that the cleaning staff might check the alarm clock to make sure it wasn't set to go off from a previous guest's setting. This isn't a horrible thing, but I was paying a lot of money, and expecting a lot of service. Also, my bathtub's stopper was stuck, and I couldn't get it lifted so shower water would drain...Maintenance was relatively prompt, but why put a guest in a less-than-perfect room? Again, paying top dollar demands over-the-top service. There was no tea in the room with the complimentary coffee, and I was directed to order it from room service if I wanted it. $350/night, and no tea? Heavens! Again, just a small breach of service I would tolerate from a lesser hotel. I requested another toothbrush, and was told it was available in my minibar; in lesser hotels, toothbrush provision is complimentary. This was aggravating. The room was large, clean, quiet, safe...and expensive. I was expecting a higher level of service, so I was disappointed. The front desk supervisor did credit my bill $50 for my inconveniences, and I am very appreciative. However, I will likely try another upscale hotel on my next visit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5610366">We celebrated our sixth wedding anniversary with a romantic weekend in Seattle, based at the Hotel Monaco. We had a King Room. The bed was sooooooo comfortable both the perfect firmness mattress and the supersoft bedding. The room was sunny by day (well, the weather helped) and the window treatments kept unwanted light out at night. The flat screen TV was a nice treat, as were pay-per-view movies and a well stocked honor bar. The concierge was able to direct us to an excellent boat tour of the harbor and locks as well as to make dinner reservations. We ate the first night in the hotel restaurant which had excellent food and excellent service up until the last moment when the server lost his cool over a small error in calculating the check. I highly recommend the crab cakes appetizer, which together with an appetizer and Washington State wine made a wonderful meal. Another local restaurant, The Brooklyn, recommended by the concierge also had excellent seafood. The Monaco is an excellent hotel for a romantic or sightseeing trip to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5537040">Hotel Monoco has very little going for it except location. Reviews in here that mention that hotel staff is lacking in service are right on the mark. In fact, I would hazard to say they go out of their way to stay away from guest. We had 4 in the room including our children and staff kept leaving only 3 sets of towels. Not a big deal but for $320/night I expect better. This hotel has some mangement problems that need to be addressed. Employees are not as friendly as you find at other Kimpton hotels (Argonaught in San Fran was first class and worth the additional dollars). Not once was I addressed by my name or even acknowledged by employees. The restaurant was nothing but ordinary and way overpriced. I don't mind the overpriced part of it if I get special attention and service. You don't at this hotel. The rooms are dull but spacious. The evening wine reception is a nice touch but the way the lobby is arranged makes for a poor place to try and meet other guest. Really not worth the time. At the end of the day I was sorely disappointed and would not go back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5499189">This Hotel Monaco, like others, is a unique hotel experience that surpasses your average, standard, nice hotel. If you like the large chain hotels (i.e. Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) and prefer that type of standard room and amenities, do not stay at the Monaco. In my opinion, those hotels, while nice, begin to all look the same after some time. However, if you prefer a smaller, boutique-type hotel with surprising, unique and whimisal rooms, you'll love it here. The service at the front desk was excellent. The wine happy hour was very nice, serving local Snoqualamie wines. My room was wonderful with a wall of windows and window seats. I was happy to discover that windows also lined the wall of the bathroom - which I have never enjoyed in a hotel. (It is nice to have some natural light in a bathroom!) The Monaco offers an easy walk to the waterfront, shopping and Pike Place Market. One point worth mention: if you are walking to the waterfront, do not walk down the street at the corner of the hotel - the sidewalk there is very steep downwards. Instead, walk down 4th street towards the Market, and head down to the waterfront a few blocks down - the sidewalks are not so steep and scary there. And while you are staying at the Monaco, do not miss going inside the Seattle Public Library across the street. It is an architectual masterpiece and definitely not your average "library." Tours are also given daily. I've stayed at other Monaco hotels and thoroughly enjoyed this one, like the others. Any time I have the opportunity to stay at a Kimpton hotel, I will. I might also say, though, that the Kimpton Hotel Vintage Park, up the street from Monaco in Seattle, is not as impressive, but stays true to the unique hotel experience. If you have a choice, go Monaco.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5494196">The Hotel Monaco Seattle has drastically gone downhill over the course of the past 3 years. I regularly stay there each summer and this last visit left me looking for new lodging options in the Emerald City. I have stayed in both the Monte Carlo Suite and a King Deluxe. PROS: - Rooms are a decent size for a city - The beds are extremely comfortable - The room has functional furniture - including a desk with 2 chairs and a comfy chair to relax in (in standard rooms) and a nice sofa an coffee table (in the Monte Carlo Suites) - Room service is very good - the Continental breakfast is fantastic and service is prompt. - The hotel has added large flat-screen televisions and DVD players in every room. CONS: - Service, service, service. I waited 15+ minutes just to check-in and was not "welcomed back" as a Kimpton In Touch member. - The front desk reception never greeted me as I came and went (something they always used to do). - They mishandled packages and phone calls routinely (not so great for a business traveler). - My Kimpton In Touch preferences were ignored altogether (room type, pillow type, etc) The personal touches are what make Kimpton hotels special. WIth the lack of service I received at this hotel, I would have much preferred the W across the street.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5488138">After staying at the wonderful San Francisco Monaco, our expectations were high when we booked this hotel. Especially since the Monaco Seattle was 100 dollars more than the SF Monaco. We were traveling home to Copenhagen so I considered using Priceline to bid low for a four star hotel. But I was so impressed with the SF Monaco that I wanted specifically to try their Seattle hotel. On the plus side, the staff was lovely and service was always prompt. The lobby was beautiful and the staff allowed us a generous 3pm checkout so we could relax before our overseas flight. The room was quiet and clean and everything worked. But we were surprised to see that the room was decorated hideously. The room we got did not, in any way shape or form resemble the beautifully designed rooms advertised on the hotels Web site. The pillows for the beds were left in the chairs and there was no bedspread. The wall paper was grey and white and very depressing. In SF, I loved the Monaco's whimsical colorful style but there was no color or design in this room. Here, I felt they had really misrepresented their rooms which were dull and boring. For me a nice decor helps make me feel at home and cheers me up and this room didnt do the trick. I actually factor in decor when I book a room and sure, the photos they advertised are usually a bit more polished than the reality but at the Monaco Seattle, it was a pure misreprentation of the decor advertised. At the San Francisco Monaco, there was a lovely spa with a sauna and big hot tub. Here in Seattle, we paid 100 dollars more than SF and there was no spa at all. Why was it so much more? Finally, the room service menu did not include any vegetarian dishes except pizza. It seems like a no brainer to consider vegetarians when you make a room service menu. If you can include dogs, why not cover about the 10 percent of the population that doesnt eat meat. We were very disappointed with the Monaco Seattle. But if you are a carnivore who doesn't care for spas or decor, you might just love the place. The service can't be faulted.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5419804">The Hotel Monaco is a quant, charming place to stay in Seattle. The lobby is beautiful and serene, with wall murals of Greek dolphins frolicking in the sea. We stayed in a standard king room and it was decorated in a whimsical, unique style. The room was also comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located in a nice central location and within walking distance to a lot of local attractions. The hotel also offers an â€œhour of indulgenceâ€�, which is a beer and wine tasting. It was nicely done and the day we were there they had a fortune teller. It was a lot of fun. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back and would recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5373238">My husband and I and our 45 pound dog stayed at the Monaco from May 12th to the 20th, 2006. We got a fantastic last minute rate (staying with the family didn't exactly work out!) and we were overwhelmed by the level of service we received from all areas of the hotel. Every person we encountered, from the very busy front desk and valet personnel to the chamber maids doing turn down service greeted us and our dog warmly on every occasion. Our dog was treated like a queen instead of being shooed away and given the evil eye like what happens at most pet "friendly" hotels. The front desk and bell/valet staff dog sat for us on several occasions and our dog had her very own leopard print chaise lounge to rest on behind the front desk. She was walked and played with and felt so at home she was distressed when we packed up the car to go to our next destination. The room was very comfortable and though it was close to the elevator, we heard no noise from it or from people walking by. The bed was dreamy, the linens divine and the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate. Room service breakfast was on time every morning, very tasty, and the tray was always removed no more than ten minutes after we put it in the hall. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were disappointed in the food, but the service was perfect. The Monaco is on Spring and 4th, across from the fabulous modern Library, and there are loads of restaurants within walking distance or a short free bus ride. We were able to take the dog for walks to the federal courthouse two blocks away which has a huge grassy hill and another great view of the library. Overall, this was the best hotel stay I have had in a major city. The Monaco has a customer for life in me and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle - with or without a dog.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5327326">We stayed in a suite at the Hotel Monaco which was just a few $ more than the quoted room. The valet met us and arranged for a bellman to get our bags and bring them to our room which was on the 9th floor tucked into the corner around from the elevator. It was amazingly quiet. We at at Tulio's at the Hotel Vintage Park. The chicken was scrumptious and the risotto was heaven with a hint of orange. It was roomy and included a 2-person jacuzzi tub in the bathroom in addition to shower stall, marble vanity and AVEDA products. After our roadtrip of 9-1/2 hours, the jacuzzi was welcome relief! We didn't order a goldfish pet but they were in the lobby downstairs, referred to as the living room and also in our elevator lobby. The king-size bed with soft, luxurious linens and comforter lulled me to sleep. I wouldn't miss dinner at The Georgian Room at the Fairmount around the corner. It too was amazing and costs almost the same as Tulio's. Food, service and atmosphere were outstanding! It's about 3 blocks downhill (ie up hill when you return) and 2 blocks over to Pike Place Market. You can walk to the Space Needle but allow 30-45 minutes and buses are free within the downtown area. So if you do hop a bus to the Space Needle, it costs $1.25.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5068547">Hotel location, decor, service and comfort level were all excellent. Great quality was consistent with other Kimpton properties. Typical of Kimpton, they had lots of unique special touches â€“ giraffe and leopard print bath robes, funky room decor, and even a live goldfish in our room (ours came with a little sign that informed us that his name was "Matt"). They seemed to have a bit of a goldfish theme going on throughout the hotel, which was kind of cute. The room and bed were very comfortable and it had remarkably soft sheets. Ours was a "King Deluxe" room and it was bigger than your average hotel room. We had a gloomy view of an office building directly next door, but we didn't pay for a view room, so I can't hold it against them. Sound seemed to travel between the rooms quite easily. We had the misfortune of having a room full of kids next door, but the front desk responded very well by moving the kids to a different part of the hotel, rather than moving us. The only thing that I didn't like about the Hotel Monaco was the $27 per day valet parking charge, which is the highest I can remember paying anywhere. Overall, it's the best boutique hotel that we've stayed at yet in Seattle. We will definitely stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4829769">Great location, walking distance to everything (except the sports fields and the Space Needle but this is a nicer area of town anyway), across street from Seattle's new library. Unique room decor - funky, colorful, assorted patterns, but fun and very comfortable. Aveda toiletries, spacious bathroom counter with room for all your personal stuff. Friendly staff. Parking expensive at $27/day + tips. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was excellent at $8-$11, nearly 1/2 what the W Hotel's restaurant across the street was charging. Room 420 was not a suite but was quite roomy and had everything you'd need. Fitness room has Precor bikes, a treadmill, stair stepper, and free weights - ask for headphones at the front desk before you go down there if you want to hear the TVs mounted at each station. Tulio, a Seattle favorite restaurant, is one block away --try the sweet potato gnocchi for an appetizer and the risotto - both excellent, as was the grilled lamb. Not cheap though - about $100 for 2 with 1/2 bottle wine. This was my first experience booking through Hotwire so was worried we'd get one of the worst rooms, but it was as nice as any I think, except maybe the suites. We paid $130 (Hotwire 4-star rating). If you don't like the big chain hotels, this is an excellent alternative.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4598624">We arrived in Seattle from Florida and had made reservations at a sister hotel Vintage Park. The guest services at Vintage Park had much to be desired. Ex-no help with luggage. So we walked around the corner to the Hotel Monaco and immediately we were treated with a warm welcome and hospitality. We decided to switch hotels, and they had our luggage moved for us, upgraded our room, delivered a fish to keep us company-(I was missing my cats)and it was completely delightful. From the restaurant downstairs, to room service, to concierage guidance, &amp; the very comfortable room. My husband is a nightowl, I'm a morning person....so the room worked perfectly. It had a sitting area with computer access and a seperate bedroom area with a curtain seperating the rooms. Two TV's--so no problem with varied intresets, and quiet time. The hotel is centrally located. All together a gem. Highly recommend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4462183">My husband and I splurged on a suite for our anniversary. The room was huge and as with all the Hotel Monaco's, the bed was very comfortable with a big comforter and lots of pillows. The bathroom was great with a nice sized shower and a separate jacuzzi tub, all stocked with Aveda products (yeah!). The food at the restaurant downstairs was good being in the middle of downtown Seattle was great. It was a bit of a walk to the baseball stadium and the Space Needle, but most other sites and shopping were within walking distance (take a cab to REI).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4310244">We decided to give Hotel Monaco a try after reading the positive reviews here on TripAdvisor, and having had excellent experiences at Kimpton Hotels in other cities. I've stayed at several downtown Seattle hotels before (including Sheraton, Grand Hyatt, The W) and while I had positive experiences at all of them, I would certainly return to Hotel Monaco before the others. It was truly outstanding in all areas from decor, cleanliness, and especially the service. The reservations and check-in process was flawless. I made a couple specific requests by email prior to our stay, and the staff always returned my emails promptly, ready to assist. We splurged and stayed in the Mediterrean Suite, which was wonderful. There was an emormous jet tub, and the room was spacious, very comfortable, and clean. The free internet access was also a plus. All other Seattle hotels I've been to have a fee. I was blown away by the friendly and competent staff at Hotel Monaco. Everyone from the front desk staff to the concierge to the housekeeping staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The only downside of our stay was that our hotel room smelled a bit of ciagrette smoke. I had specifically requested a nonsmoking room. When I called the front desk, they assured us that we were on a nonsmoking floor, but that they'd be happy to move us to another room immedietly if we were not happy. Because we so enjoyed our unique suite, we decided to stay rather than move to a smaller room. We were more irritated by the guests who'd stayed before us and smoked in a nonsmoking room than we were with the hotel, which made efforts to remedy the situation. Following our stay, I received a thoughtful and personal email from one of their staff members apologizing for the occurence and guaranteeing that the problem would be discussed with housekeeping in an effort to more thoroughly clean rooms of smoke in the future. I was extremely impressed with this timely response, especially because I'd never made a formal complaint about the room, I had just mentioned it briefly. We were offered a discount on our next stay because of the "inconvience," but even without a discount, I would make Hotel Monaco my #1 hotel choice in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4163693">I had really high hopes for the Hotel Monaco when we chose it as our base for a girlfriend's shopping trip to Seattle. But after our stay, I would say that given the competition in Seattle, it was just okay. The hotel has a lot of nice features but little things that detract: The bedding is super soft and luxurious with down comforters and pillows. But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling. We stayed in room 815 and there was a noise like a fog horn that vibrated through the walls off and on through our stay. My guess is it's the water pipes but it was really annoying. On waking the first morning we found that we had two packages of decaf instead of regular coffee. It took them 30 minutes to send up coffee and then they showed up with just one package. This is coffee town USA and you get one little package and 3 tiny dried creamers? There was supposed to be coffee service in the lobby but we never saw any. It must be cleared really early. It's gone by 10AM. The wine reception is from 5-6 and boy you better get there on time because if you walk in at 5:50 like we did you get a look from the manager like you are trying to scope a 2nd glass. That and the food was a plate of goldfish crackers. Classy. Friday night the restaurant and bar were closed by 4pm for a private party. That was where we planned to eat since we'd heard so much about the fun bar. It was another bummer to add to the rest. All over the hotel are posters that say things like the hotel is all about "you" and your comfort etc. But we felt neither catered to or comfortable. No one on staff ever asked us how we were doing or even said hello. We'll be looking elsewhere for our next visit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4080763">I had a business trip for four days and decided to bring my wife and new baby. I decided to stay at the Monaco because their Monte Carlos Suite was spacious, had two entertainment centers, CD player and of course the gold fish. They accommodated me with a larger robe for taller people and provided extra room in the refrigerator so we could store breast milk. Before we arrived I was able to email with a reservationists who answered many questions and provided me local services for baby rental gear and sitter services. I had multiple email transactions and each one was responded in a professional friendly manner. Of course it's hard to do everything perfect. I had trouble using their one-touch phone buttons to connect to either the concierge or room service as the phone would just receive a busy signal without re-routing the call to the front desk, and after I called the front desk directly they offered to have room service call and that never happened. Overall the experience and people were friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed first walking into the colorful room and having their own special jazz CD playing (nice touch). If you choose to stay here you won't go wrong!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3938205">We spent the first two days of our honeymoon in the honeymoon suite at the Hotel Monaco and couldn't have had a better time. The room was beautiful. We had a fabulous jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. We lived it up, lounging around in our leopard-print robes. The hotel was immaculate. Between 5 and 6 pm both nights, we indulged in the complimentary wine and beer. It's close to everything, and we walked a lot. Best of all, it was only $190 per night (midweek). We absolutely recommend Hotel Monaco Seattle, and would stay there again in a heartbeat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3900475">I spent a week with my g-friend over Labor Day for Bumbershoot. The Gray line airporter drops off around the corner from the hotel for about 10 per person, by cab 28 total but make sure they give you the flat rate or Town Car is 38. The location is central downtown across the street from W. Itâ€™s a quick walk to most points of tourist or business interest. Yes the Space Needle is a bit far off but you can take the monorail at the Westlake Center, which is an easy walk away. For the tourist the Underground tour, Public Market, Space Needle and EMP are a must. Leave a bit of room in your luggage because the shopping is great. The neighborhood is very safe and clean. Room: The Mediterranean Suite is quite large, equipped with a two-person Jacuzzi tub and small stand up glass-enclosed shower. The room had no view but we did not care. The room was clean except for a small throw blanket that adorned the foot of the bed, which we took off. It was tastefully decorated and the walls were striped. Trust me you wont feel like you are in a stale hotel. Ask for a gold fish or bring your well-behaved dog for company. Service: All aspects are excellent. Front desk house keeping concierge room service bell desk are all ready to provide you with the warm and professional service. Test them they donâ€™t flinch. Gym: Open 24 hours with several newer cardio machines and a few dumbbells. The highest weight being 25. They have water towels and a TV. Goldâ€™s however is within walking distance. Gastronomy: Sazerac is worth a try if not impressive itâ€™s amusing. This was my third visit to Seattle first to Monaco. While I like the beds at Westin better I prefer Monaco at least until I can afford W. This being my g-friends first visit to both she wants to go back for Bumbershoot next year and stay at Hotel Monaco.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3797117">We were recently in Seattle for two days and stayed at the Hotel Monaco. We had a basic room with a kingsize bed, and felt the room was sizeable. Loved the crazy print robes! They were a nice touch. Did not adopt a goldfish for our stay, but had a chance to visit with some in the hallway and lobby. Another nice, quirky touch that makes you remember this place. The bedding was some of the most comfortable that we have had. We also enjoyed the wine hour in the lobby, where we got a chance to meet some other people and share travel stories. Aside from a lackluster breakfast at Sazerac where our waiter was one of the worst we have ever had, we would highly recommend this place to travellers.<topic>none</topic>

Our room was not quite ready, but the lobby was comfy and we were upgraded to an eighteenth floor corner room with a gorgeous view by a very sweet and professional front desk gal. Breakfast was included, quite tasty and dinner was very nice with good choices of beverages and suggested wine pairings. The hotel is located near Seattle Center and the monorail. We walked to both and to the waterfront, Pike Place Market, downtown and even the International district, but we are fit and not averse to getting slightly rained on. The pool and spa area is small, but both were clean and other guests were all polite and pleasant. Everyone seemed to be having a good stay as smiles were shared in common areas. We will be back.

We didnot eat in the restaurant except for one Happy Hour, but heard @ the Tourist Bureau it was a good restaurant.

<comment category="negative" id="UR126890673">So, I booked a hotel room at the Warwick Hotel in Seattle, Washington. I got there with my 2 boys around 8:30 at night...they offer a "late" checkin, so I thought we were okay getting there at that time, since I had to work that day and then drive the 2.5 hours down there from Vancouver, BC. We arrived, checked in, went up to our room, and there was ONE bed. My 2 sons are BOTH over 6 feet tall, and there was NO way, I was going to sleep on the couch, or make one of them sleep on the couch, since I reserved a room that would sleep all of us. When I went downstairs to inform them, and ask for a different room, they let me know that if I booked through a 3rd party (Hotwire) then they only had to give me what was left, and not what I requested. Oh REEEEEEAAAALLLLLY?!?! So, I ended up having to pay $40/night for a room UPGRADE, because apparently THAT room (with 2 beds) wasn't "AVAILABLE". WTF. Nighttime front desk service was dismal. Daytime service, was lovely. Oh...and...be prepared to spend $30 on hotel parking, PER NIGHT. Public lots only charge $10 overnight, and $12 daytime....so somehow, the hotels (who are taking all your money in the first place) can't give guests a rate break, but instead, charge even MORE. Bad. Bad. Bad.<topic>none</topic>

We heard the 2 way radio directly outside the door. THIS WAS THE SECURITY!!. needles to say we did not sleep the rest of the night. The Manager listen to my issues, did not offer any support however he would look into it. We waited now over a month and still no call regarding this issue so it is important that people know of this. IT OBVIOUSLY WAS BRUSHED UNDER THE RUG. BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE STAYING HERE.

<comment category="positive" id="UR126709769">My husband and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle for one night in March 2012. We decided to try the Warwick because the room price at our usual hotel had increased about 30% in the past year. Except for a few nit-picky things, we were quite happy with the Warwick. We thought it offered good value. The Warwick is within a couple blocks walking distance of shopping in downtown Seattle and the rooms were nice and pretty clean (the bathroom tap had obviously been missed in the cleaning by the look of all the water spots). I also noticed the veneer on the bottom of the bathroom door was split and coming away from the wood (it looked like it may have withstood a "flood" or two) and the fixtures were a bit outdated but all this is easily forgiven considering the dollars saved bought us a lovely lunch at a nearby Tom Douglas restaurant. One last note, "valet" parking was included in our room package but when we arrived (via a circular route because of all the one-way streets) we were told that, no, their "valet" parking is where you park the car yourself in a garage around the corner (which we just passed trying to get to the front of the hotel) and then had to drive another 4 blocks around (because of the one way streets) to "valet" park our own car. Really? They should state that the cost of parking is included, rather than "valet" parking. Lastly, checkout the following morning was a dream. The service we received was excellent. Taking all this into account, I will return if their prices continue to undercut the competition.<topic>none</topic>

Housekeeping man compared his Blackberry to mine in the hallway and Housekeeper returns to the room with facecloths only to "scold" me for something.

<comment category="negative" id="UR126140426">This hotel was a great deal being under $100.00 a night. There are very few decent downtown hotels at that price point. This hotel is within walking distance to so many restaurants, stores and local attractions such as Pike Place Market and the Space Needle (this one is a bit of a longer walk). There is also a movie theater and small grocery store across the street. Also, there is a restaurant on site. Check in experience was surprisingly good- long wait but front desk agent was super nice! My complaints about the hotel would be the beds and bathroom! The beds were extremely uncomfortable- squeaky and quality that you would find at a MOTEL. The bathroom was super small! The water pressure was low for sink and shower due to them "Going Green". I'm all about going green but I felt like I used more water because the pressure was low.

I was by myself and thinking - ok for myself - but I probably wouldn't book it again with my spouse or family. It is starting to feel a bit old. Desk chair that should have been replaced years ago. Old vintage tv you may be lucky to find in a thrift shop. Shower is about a foot too low for a 6' guy. On the other hand, it was cheap, quiet, friendly staff and the bed was comfortable. If you are travelling to Seattle as I did this time, and are hardly going to be in the room, and don't need to catch a game on tv, it really isn't bad. Be prepared to pay an extra $30 for parking and another $10 for internet for a day when taking the cost into account.<topic>none</topic>

The valet's were always on standby when needed to have your car brought up. We were in a newly renovated room with a view of the Space Needle. It is located on 4th ave which made it very easy to go back from Century Link and Safeco as it is on the same street as the exit from the two stadiums.. Macy's and a gourmet grocery store is nearby. Room service was delivered within 15 minutes in the morning, and within 20 minutes in the evening The beds were comfortable.

It is in a good location if you want walking distance to Seattle Center (Space Needle). I picked it because we had tickets to a show at Jazz Alley, Seattles largest Jazz venue. Jazz Alley is a block away. Brassier Margaux ($$$) is an excellent restaraunt off the lobby of the hotel. They have a good breakfast menu too. We paid $10 more for a higher floor with a view of the Space needle. The balcony is small but it wrapped around the corner so we had an obstructed view of Elliot Bay. 2 computers in the business center. They couldn't get them online?

<comment category="negative" id="UR123945899">We stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights. Our first priority in booking a hotel was to leave the car parked at the hotel so we can walk everywhere downtown.

The hotel was renovated but the rooms still felt a bit old and dreary. Staff at hotel were quite nice and service was very efficient. We paid $69/night on hotwire, but then there is a $30/night charge for parking. If I could get this price next time, I would stay here again because of the location.

Stayed for New Years, again, this year watching the fireworks from our room with a birds eye view. Good deal for what was a very busy night. The staff are remarkable from the valet all the way to the front desk manager, and you know who you are. I would highly recommend this for the service, convenience and an overall pleasant experience. The rooms are clean and spacious. The corner suites are very nice. You can park your car and walk throughout downtown Seattle, Belltown, Space Needle even Pioneer Square. A good deal is the Warwick Escapes which includes your room, parking, breakfast for 2 and all taxes.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122845296">The Warwick Seattle is generally shabbier than I expect from a 3.5-star hotel: the carpets on the stairs leading to the second floor are dingy and worn, the lobby is tiny, the furniture in my room looked dated, the hotel exterior looked dated, the coffeemaker in my room had some rust on the heating element. All of these things added up to a hotel that seemed as though it peaked in 1988 and has been in a state of decline since. I was also given a terrible room: on the second floor (207), with banquet staff passing by my door constantly, the neon lights of the Cinerama just outside of my window, and listening to buses drive by all day and night. It felt like I was sleeping in a bus terminal. When I asked for another room, I was told that I would have to pay more for anything better (though the hotel hardly seemed busy). Perhaps those who stay in the executive suites have better luck, but this really felt to me like a 2-star experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122580632">We stayed at the Warwick Seattle for one night between Christmas and New Year. The Hotel is a nice 4 star typical American Hotel. The room was very large, clean a comfortable. Definately worth the 90 dollar a night rate. Furthermore, the location was perfect, we were a 5 minute walk from Pike Market and the main shopping area. The only complaint would be that the price of parking was a bit high. If you book just make sure to ask for a higher floor with a view of the space needle, the view is great!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122497017">Love the Warwick! Two old friends joined me in Seattle to celebrate the New Year and we chose the Warwick. We were absolutely delighted! The staff is exemplary...Brian, Robert and, yes, even Bill, were so helpful and so very, very patient with a very tired and picky Alaskan guest.This hotel is located three blocks from Macy's; five blocks from Nordstroms...what more could we want? Oh yeah, and right across the street is Ralph's so if you need a latte in the morning or a bottle of wine in the evening you've got it! Perfect. I want to thank the whole Warwick staff for making the start of 2012 so good! I hope to see you again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122432484">We had a very nice stay in Seattle at the Warwick, I would stay here again. The location is excellent for shopping and doing all the touristy things you will want to do, with an awesome grocery store across the street called Ralph's . We had a nice room facing the Space Needle which I would highly recommend asking for, as we also saw some rooms from the outside that I would not want to be in as the view would be non-existent. My only gripe was a couple of the front desk staff were very un-informed about the area and directions etc which I found highly unprofessional. But over all good place and enjoyable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122340242">Booked two nights in this hotel mainly to get a room with Space Needle view so my Mom who is a senior citizen can see the New Year's eve fireworks comfortably inside the room. When I booked online, I specified that request. When we arrived at the hotel on Dec 31st at 1pm, again I made that request and I was told a room is available with a king size bed, which is fine as long as it has the Space Needle view. I was ready to pay to reserve the room but the receptionist refused to take my card and told me to come back at 3 instead and the room will be ready. Came back at 5pm and another receptionist checked us in but told us the room is not available anymore, they transferred us to a City View room. Why??? This receptionist told us we only booked for a deluxe room and WE NEED TO UPGRADE to get a room with Space Needle View! I would rather these people be straight with me and say they want more money rather then give me excuses!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122327103">My husband and I always stay at the Warwick in Seattle. We love the hotel. The location is in Bell Town, near Pike's Street Market, the shopping district, Whole Foods, but also very close to the jogging trail along Elliott Bay. The staff is always friendly and accommodating (many of them have worked there for years. Always a good sign.) The price is reasonable and our view of the Space Needle is an added bonus. On Christmas night Chef Chris made us the best seared tuna we've ever eaten. We stayed 8 nights and hated to leave!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122238737">Stayed in the Warwick right before Christmas and couldn't be happier. The location and value was excellent. The hotel is located a few blocks away from public transportation, so getting there from the airport was a breeze! The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. They also have a nice lounge downstairs that is comfy and a fun little bar with a happy hour. Everyone was so nice, opening the doors for us as we entered and exited the hotel. Our view was great! We looked out over the city with the Space Needle in the distance. I would def stay here again if I travel back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

Over $50 in hidden fees. $30 parking, $1.00 to make a local phone call, Seattle tax, hotel tax, tourist fee??? $10 continental breakfeast ( which is just a dried out muffin, terrible coffee, and a 1/2 cup of juice.) Then to top it off, the "hostess" was nothing but attitude. The couch in our room had a big hole in it, the floor was all stained, and we will never stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121577671">Warwick Seattle it is one of old hotels in downtown. People in the reception are very nice and friendly. The lobby has a charm of the old woods floor and heavy,dark, wooded furniture..The place remind me the hotels from Agatha Christi stories. Rooms are medium size,clean and they have balcony. The balconies are very tiny - you cant even to step on it but I like big windows. Most rooms have views for downtown. The location is good - just few blocks from market,niddel etc..It is not luxury hotel but excellent choice for city break or pre-cruise accomodation in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121340223">We picked this hotel as our base camp for the Seattle marathon. The location is great and it's walking distance to the space needle, market, malls and art museum. As an added bonus take the train from Sea-tac airport to the end of the line and it's a 4 block walk to the hotel. The Hotel is a little dated but clean and comfortable but has sauna, pool, hotub and exercise room. The rates are a steal for downtown. We found the staff to be helpful they even ordered pizza from a restaurant down the street for us. (Bambino's it has awesome wood fired pizza) All thing considered I would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121272613">We have stayed in this Hotel twice now. It is in a fantastic location within walking distance to Pike Market, city shopping, Space Needle and more. The room is well appointed, quiet and clean. The bathroom is generous and good water pressure which is always a good point. The only part that let us down was the staff at the front desk. They just didn't have the service that other Hotels had. It was all business - no warm welcome or conversation. There was no warmth in their welcome or help. The bar and restuarant staff were completely different. They would stay and chat and ask questions about where we were from, and give advice on what to see and seemed genuinely interested in our holiday adventures. Even the Manager came and spoke with us and made us feel like old friends. We would stay here again - just hope that the check in staff and doorman get some personality and warmth.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121173078">My husband and I recently spent a 3 day weekend in Seattle and due to bad weather were very delayed in checking in. When we got to the hotel 8 hours later than originally planned we were greeted by a very nice young lady at the front desk who was very pleasant and efficient. We got into our room with no fuss and given it was already after 10 p.m. and we had been travelling for over 8 hours, we were very thankful for the fast efficient service. This was our third stay at the Warwick. Every time we have had occasion to stay at the Warwick we have always been very happy with the service. We love the proximity to shopping and the Warwick will remain our hotel of choice when we visit Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120885300">i first stayed @ the warwick last winter. it felt like i was living there as i was in and out constantly while dealing w/ the deaths of my parents. i always received good service. one evening i thought to put my i book in the room safe. when i came very late after a night out, i couldn't open the safe. no one on site could either due to the lateness of the hour. as i had an early flight, they called someone to come back in and moved me to a different room so i would not be disturbed. on another visit my balcony door jammed; i was eventually moved and the manager of the shift bought me breakfast for my inconvenience. as a non smoker, i wasn't even aware the hotel had a smoking floor. i never thought to request non smoking, but fortunately i was never placed in a smoking room. the rooms i have been in are always clean and comfortable. i always choose the south (parkade) side of the hotel as i am a light sleeper and prefer to be away from the street. i have never been given a room below the top of the parkade. stafff both at the front desk and on the telephone are always friendly and helpful. for travellers, the hotel is a few minutes walk from the light rail, a 15 minute walk from the victoria clipper and under 25 minute walk from south lake union where the float plane departs for victoria and the san juan islands. the neighbourhood is full of shoping and dining opportunities and walking distance to most downtown attractions. my stay this weekend was great<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120797770">I emailed ahead asking for early check in because I was arriving in town by 9:00 AM. They said they could not promise me a room, which is to be expected. I arrived at the hotel, asked if a room was available as we had our luggage and heavy bags with us. I was then told by a lady at the front desk that our type of room was not available but if we wanted to upgrade there would be a room available. I asked how much and was told $50/ night. Totally not worth it so decided to pass. She then tried to put us in a different room. She made a comment about it being for a king bed when we reserved two double beds. I corrected her and she was then arguing with me about it saying that the rate I paid was not enough for the double bed room. I pulled out my confirmation showing my reservation and she still didn't want to put me in a double bed room. The concierge said he would lock our bags in a closet, which we appreciated. I had returned to retrieve something out of my suitcase and one, the room they were stored in smelled horribly of natural gas, two the concierge came in the room with me and proceeded to hit on me and tried to get me to go out with him that night. Not the end of the world by any means, but very uncomfortable in a closed up small storage closet. The window of our room faced a cement wall. We did not receive any daylight at all, as ithe cement wall blocked out all the light. The room smelled terribly of smoke whenever someone in a room around us was smoking. The smell was so overwhelming that it smelled like someone in our room as smoking. Aside from the dark and smoke smell the room was decent and comfortable. The hotel was in a good location with a short walk to each Pike's Market and the Space Needle. There was a (although quite expensive) grocery/wine store right across the street. Checkout went quick and easy.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120600071">We only had 1 night in Seattle, so wanted somewhere that was central to attractions and this Hotel delivered. Upon arriving a few hours early from the train station, we where greeted with a friendly welcome and they checked us in straight away. As we where from overseas, we where very happy to be given a room on the 5th floor with views towards the Space Needle, so that was a really bonus to us. The hotel staff where all really friendly &amp; helpful. They gave us maps, directions &amp; suggestions on what to do or try while in the city. Room - as mentioned above we where thrilled to have a view of the Space Needle. Our room was clean, neat &amp; tidy. Decor was not modern, but it was all tidy &amp; nice - I'm there to see the city, not the decor of a room personally. Good space, with fridge &amp; I really liked that that had actually glassess, instead of plastic cups that you are normally given. Also had a room safe. We experienced no problem with it being noisey. Location - right across the road from a Grocery Shop (had wine &amp; dinner that you can buy). 2 min walk to Western Lake Centre &amp; appx 7 - 10 min to Pike Place. We didn't eat at the resturant so can't comment. There was lots of resturants around this area for choice though. Also there was an old style cinema right across the street. Also they had somewhere to store our pile of luggage the next day while we where out exploring the following day, along with a lounge style area to also wait in. It was exactly what we wanted - some where comfortable to sleep for a night, along with a great view.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120557341">I have just returned from spending the weekend in Seattle at this grand older hotel. Clipper Navigation offered the Warwick as the hotel for Friday and Saturday night stay in their all inclusive travel/hotel/taxes deal. I am supremely glad that I took the deal. Since Friday was a holiday, Clipper put on a noon sailing, which turned into a 11:30 sailing and I got to spend more time in Seattle. After a slow, nice, about 30 minute walk from Clipper terminal to the Warwick, I was greeted by two pleasant and professional young ladies at the front desk and was quickly assigned my room and given my pass card. I already knew that I would be on the smoking (9th) floor, (I am a non smoker but spend a lot of time around smokers) as it was the only one left when I booked. The room was quite spacious, and had a lovely view of the Space Needle. There was a slight smoking odor when I opened the door, but that quickly disappeared. The room was very clean, TV was in a nice cabinet, which was very strong as I bumped into it a few times in the dark. A very large comfortable king size bed, which i got lots of sleep on. A very nice writing desk, which I used quite a bit. A small refrigerator, which kept my pop very cold and a nice coffee maker. In the closet was a small safe, an ironing board and iron. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo, with a regular shower head and a wand shower head. The hotel has ice machines on several different floors, soda/snack machines on the B floor. Also on the B floor is the exercise room containing free weights, modern work out machines, (sorry I don't know the names of the machines), 3.6 foot deep pool/hot tube combo, and a sauna, which I all used, and enjoyed. Major transportation stops are within 4 blocks of the hotel. Public transit is second to none in this city, and I sure did not miss my vehicle for getting around. This hotel may be old, but she is solid. I was in the corner room with two streets outside my windows, and when I went to bed, there was very little noise, and I slept like a baby. My room was warm and comfortable. The ladies at the front desk cheerfully programed my wake up calls for both days and they were right on time. The hotel also has a nice restaurant, which I will review in more detail in the restaurant section. There are tons of restaurants within a 15 minute walk, Ralph's grocery/wine store across the street (serves very good chili), an older cinema across the street (which I plan to go to next time). All in all, I really enjoyed my stay at this Grand Old Lady!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120433805">Although the smoking rooms were a big plus for us, the room and the hotel overall are very dated and in need of renovation. Bathroom was OK but the tub and faucets were really old as was the decor all around. The TV (old style, no flat screens here!) was hidden away in an strange piece of furniture that almost fell apart on us during our stay. Breakfast was good and moderately priced. Concierge was very helpful both times I needed directions and information. Coffee in room was good and very appreciated when we got up at 5am jetlagged!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120433437">I stayed at the Warwick with some girlfriends while I was in town for a weekend wedding. The hotel is very nice and the front desk clerks are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location: right across the street from a Ralph's Market which has plenty of champagne; a 7 - 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market; close to some great restaurants (Local 360, Serious Pie, Lola) and right next to a cool old cinema (which I didn't go to). The rooms are comfortable and well equipped with nice glasses to drink from and plenty of them. I have no complaints about anything having to do with the room. My main complaint is the horrible room service food (not the guy who actually brought it up, he was very nice). We ordered breakfast in our room both mornings (Sunday and Monday) and the food was not only bland, badly cooked, and cold but both mornings they messed up the order. The last morning I ordered one of their special omelets that comes with mushrooms and cheese and my omelet came without the cheese! That's ridiculous! They did offer to make me a new one but as I had to catch a plane I didn't have a time so I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Because there are so many great restaurants in the area I'm sure you can find another place to eat breakfast, but if you're on a schedule and don't have time to spend leisurely finding a good breakfast joint, you're going to have to suffer through the room service. Sorry and good luck! I slept on the sleeper sofa which was terrible and why I gave them a 3 for sleep quality. I didn't hear my friends complain about the bed so I assume they were fine.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120107379">Stayed 1 night at the Warwick hotel on Oct. 29th Arrived at 12:00pm and used self parking, $26.00 for the night and valet is also $26.00 per night. Parked on the 7 level of parkade and took stairs to lobby as there is no elevator in the parkade. Check in was quick and easy less then 5 minutes. Our room was on the second floor and was clean. Room was small with 2 double beds, 26" old tv, small fridge in room and a coffee maker. Small bathroom with a shower and tub combo. Water tap for shower would not shut off completely. Over all if you get a good price for your stay, Under $100.00 a night, The hotel is a decent 3.5 star hotel, Close to most attractions etc..

<comment category="negative" id="UR119997612">The location is great; very central, close to shopping, only blocks away from the Convention Center and Pike Place Market. The staff was more than helpful, even went as far as digging through the kitchen to bring us up a bottle opener. The parking situation is interesting. The garage is adjacent, but stairs have to be used to make it to the hotel lobby; no elevator as an option. It was hard to get the luggage back and forth through the stairwell. We were on the 14th floor, which is one of the more updated floors. It's nice enough, but MUCH smaller that what shows on the pictures. The bathroom is nice but so small only one of us could be in there at a time, which was problematic when getting ready to go out for our dining and dancing. Overall, it's an okay hotel, but I'd probably go with a larger chain close by, that is more updated.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119859654">We stayed here twice in 2 weeks, during our honeymoon. The first time it was just for a night and the experience was average. The parking garage is small, crowded and a nightmare to navigate; the attendants are not much help nor as friendly if you choose to park yourself instead of using the valet service. A week later we stayed for 4 nights and used the valet. The people at the desk are friendly enough, but not very informative. The second time around we got a room on the second floor that had not been renovated. I dont mind that the stuff is outdated as long as it works. The hair dryer was not functioning, the tv (big old tv) was fuzzy and did not have a remote control, the shower had no water pressure and when we took out the old beat up ironing board, a dirty handkerchief fell out of the closet; disgusting. If you have to stay there, make sure you ask for a clean, updated room. The reason I did not rate this as "terrible" is because the restaurant was GREAT (although pricy) and the front desk will mail out your post-cards for you--very convenient!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119843410">Cute hotel, but lobby was shabby and should've been redecorated/refurbished years ago. The bed and room were clean and comfortable, although the sheets were greyed/dingy with age (a shame - how much do sheets cost and how often do they replace them???) Location was great, within walking distance of most attractions, shopping, eating and bars - but can be kind of difficult with people with walking disabilities (I have bad knees and it was rather painful for me, especially with the HILLS - Seattle is VERY HILLY in lots of areas). My husband had no trouble at all walking all over the place (he 'scouted' out the area). The staff was very friendly and helpful, esp. the consigner (sp?). Our room was eye level with the parking garage; we asked to be moved - was granted the request but the room was on a lower level and the noise level would have been terrible at night (the view was much better, though), but we opted for 'quiet' instead of 'view' and stayed where we were. Seattle is a beautiful city, but it's hilly and it's filled with a lot of weirdo's and freaks of all ages, and I'm not just talking about the homeless - which there were plenty of them, also. Occupy Seattle was going on when we were there, and they were all tattooed, pierced, weird dressed, dirty/nasty drudge/dred locked, grungy-looking young people, and we have young adult kids ourselves, in addition to other young people in our city, so we KNOW what 'weird' looks like. As soon as we entered downtown Seattle, we saw an â€˜Occupy Seattleâ€™ person sitting in a pretty, flowered/treed area, smoking a cigarette and holding a handmade sign that read: â€œKill Wall Streetâ€� and had a skull and bones sign drawn on it. Not a very pleasant â€˜welcomingâ€™ to Seattle, I thought. There was also a huge paddy wagon (VERY large van) and tons of policemen at the main gathering site of the protesters, which was downtown in the main shopping district. Seattle IS a nice place, but itâ€™s a shame there are so many weirdos around. Hopefully the protesters will move on by the time future visitors visit this lovely city. This hotel is o.k. if youâ€™re on a budget and have no trouble walking, and IF you get a good rate â€“ we got it for $99, so we couldnâ€™t pass it up. I didn't rate this hotel very high because there's no reason why hotels have dingy/grey looking sheets - it lowers one's opinions about the place, even if the room itself is very clean. Our room also had the old tube tv, but that didn't matter to me but it might matter to others.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119686863">Downtown Seattle is an expensive place to book a hotel room -- $99 per night rate is considered â€œbudget.â€� (i.e., the Travelodge by the Space Needle is $125 per night). So, finding a hotel with the location that Warwick has -- for $99 per night --I didnâ€™t have great expectations, although it is part of an international â€œluxuryâ€� hotel chain. Getting to and from the hotel was easy on the Seattle city bus system, and surrounding it are numerous restaurants of all kinds. Itâ€™s within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping district and right next door to the Jazz Alley. We were on the 8th floor overlooking the parking lot but had a view of downtown, which was good because any lower the noise from the street would have made sleeping difficult. A room on a higher floor with a view of the Space Needle would have been great but, for a rate of $99, we were fine with the view and the quiet room. The room was not big but very adequate with a somewhat dated dÃ©cor, but it did have some nice touches (nice wall art and a Shoji lantern type floor lamp). The lighting was good and the bed was very comfortable. The marble sink and tub surround are very nice. I especially appreciated the vanity shelf (which I wish more hotels would have) and the complimentary bath items were rather upscale. But, what I was most impressed with is that I believe this hotel actually takes their water conservation program seriously. I was fine with the low water pressure because I was so impressed with the low-flow, QUIET flushing toilet. I was rather surprised, though; that the lobby was so nondescript since the Seattle Warwick is part of a luxury chain, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. So, the Seattle Warwick exceeded my expectations for a â€œbudgetâ€� in the middle of downtown Seattle and we look forward to staying there again soon.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119499336">Me and my teenage son came to Seattle for the weekend, with the highlight being the Seahawks game on Sunday. We arrived on Friday morning at the hotel at 10:30am, I was hoping to at least drop my bags off at the hotel as we toured the town, but to my surprise, they actually checked us in our room, it was only 10:30am! I was very pleased with that and a nice way to start off the weekend. I had asked for early check in, but I really didn't expect it that early. The room was acceptable and clean, very much a typical room I would stay in, we weren't here to stay in the room all weekend. Even got a corner room (on 6th floor) that had a view of downtown and of the space needle. Cleaning staff always said "Hi" to me when they could have easily ignored me. Even though we could have stayed closer to the more active part of downtown, I didn't want to pay the higher price and had no problem walking the 4 or so blocks to get to some of tourist spots or the public transportation hubs (we did not rent a car). This area of diowntown seemed very quite compared to just a few blocks south, wasn't much activity around or people walking around when we were there, but I always felt safe. I checked out on the morning of the game, but the front desk still allowed me to check in my luggage with them so I didn't have to take it with me to the game. I was vey appreciative of that. Not renting a car probably saved me $200 in car rental and parking fee's, but we did have to walk and take busses/train, which was pretty simple since I had researched it well, but would have been much more difficult if I had not. Hotel is real close to Top Pots Doughnuts too! Overall, I would stay here again, I felt the combination of the price and location was ideal for this type of trip.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119126348">Arrived at the hotel at 11am on a Sunday and without heistation were given a room. We were using the location as an in transit so only had the one night. The lobby area is compact, basic and functional provided you don't arrive with a group booking. Service was no friills, functional but lacking in friendliness and warmth. The room was a good size with a view, albeit uninspiring. You could open a window but it was a bit noisey at evening time.. There is a theatre (limited opening times) across the road, a grocery store on the other corner and it is a only a 10 minute walk to downtown. We did not explore eating options nearby but there seemed limited choice in the immediate vicinity. The business centre near the lobby has two free internet computers that seem to be in demand so pick your time or wait. We did have dinner at the hotel restaurant and found the service to be OK, the attention to a special diet to be first class, the prices are fair but the meal portions are on the small size. We paid full price but if you can get a special or last minute rate then it would represent good value. OK for an overnight stay but may have reservations for a longer duartion.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119090604">My husband and I stayed here the evening of Monday, September 19th. We arrived via the airport just before 8am and, of course, our rooms were not available. We left our bags and the *RUDE* concierge (light hair) said he would take them â€“ though he did seem to act like maybe they were covered in mud or something?? We left the hotel and walked directly from 4th street up two easy breezy blocks to 2nd street and got some Starbucks. We spent our entire day walking downtown Seattle â€“ from the Pike Place Market to the waterfront (ate at the Crab Pot and took a harbor cruise) to the liquor store on 2nd street &amp; Seneca to the harbor steps and back. We called at 12:00 and our room was not ready yet so we just kept walking and enjoying downtown Seattle as we had a tour planned anyway. We finally returned to our room at 4:30pm. We had prepaid and got a fantastic rate on our room. The *RUDE* concierge saw us come in and made himself invisible. The front desk clerk told us our bags would be delivered to our room so we took the elevator up and hoped she was correct. I had just walked in the bathroom when all the bags were delivered (quickly) but I didnâ€™t see who delivered them. My husband tipped the guy and we worried no more. We had a beautiful view of the Space Needle, a nice comfy bed, a big &amp; clean bathroom, and everything you could really want for a stay. We had a small couch and we prefer one big chair but it worked-out fine. It was nice and cool out this evening so we opened our balcony and let the breeze blow-in. We took a nap and then walked to Ralphâ€™s â€“ literally across the street â€“ and got some deli sandwiches (good) and soda. Ralphâ€™s also sells wine, chips, grocery items, etc but they are quite expensive. We paid $14 for two sandwiches, a yogurt for breakfast the next morning ($3.99 just for that) and a fountain soda. It was worth it for the convenience to the hotel. Ralphâ€™s is open until 2am, btw. We slept well, no noise, despite the area. The ice machine was just one floor down, no problem. There is obvious remodeling going on in the hotel because you could see some of it marked off and smell the new paint but it did nothing to dampen our stay. Our wake-up call came on time and we were showered and dressed and out the door by 6:00 am. Hubby checked us out in no time. We had no charges as we had prepaid and not used the Internet or purchased anything. They put a $50 hold on a credit card but released it later. The morning of Sept 20th we had an incredibly friendly concierge (dark hair) who went out of his way to help us get a ride to the Amtrak station to catch the train to Vancouver â€“ he actually got us a very nice ride to the station for $10 flat. Good deal. Nice concierge, great driver, all was well. Would we stay here again? For the location, price, and convenienceâ€¦ sure. There were A LOT of goods that far outweighed one bad. The concierge from Sept 19th, however, has a lot to learnâ€¦ this was probably the â€œworstâ€� hotel we stayed at on our 20-night vacation and was by far well below the standards we are used too â€“ we have had much better service all over the world - just because we were wearing jeans and shirts does not mean we donâ€™t deserve the same respect as your older business travelers in suits.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118423295">This was our second time staying here in three years. Near the downtown centre, with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. Online booking revealed no rooms, but a phone call to the property gave us an upgraded room for the price of a regular room. Parking is next door but pricey ($30). In honour of our return visit we were treated to Perrier and baked goods, along with a thank you note. Very classy. The concierge was helpful, saving us money on transportation to the Mariners game ... who knew Seattle had an underground bus system, and it was free to the ballpark? Will stay here again. Some freshening of the common areas and better/cheaper parking are the only reasons this isn't a 5.<topic>none</topic>

We stayed at 5 or 6 different hotels but none compared to our stay at the Warwick. It was absolutely awesome. The staff was very kind, the rooms were excellent and the food was outstanding, especially the prime rib. If we ever return to Seattle we would head straight for the Warwick. Seattle is one of the prettiest cities I have ever visited. I highly recommend that everyone that visits Seattle to stay at the Warwick.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117982088">After a fishing trip to Alaska, my wife and I stopped off for three nights in Seattle (we're from North Carolina and wanted to visit this beautiful West Coast Mecca). We've been to Seattle before and knew that downtown hotels can be pricey, so we chose the Warwick which has an excellent location and is inexpensive ($135/night on the internet before taxes). It was a good decision. The Warwick is located close to Pike's Place and the Seattle Museum of Art (two "must" sees). The hotel is a little dated, but is well maintained. The staff is efficient and friendly. We had a 10th floor view of the Space Needle which we enjoyed. We wholeheartedly recommend staying here if you're looking for a first class hotel in a good location (excellent in hotel restaurant and others close by, Pike's Place, the Metro, the Space Needle and SAM). Next time we visit Seattle, this is the place we'll stay. PS: be sure to take a ride on the Duck-an bus/boat-which you'll see touring around. It's as fun as it looks and cost about $28/person for a land, lake ride-the drivers are funny, energetic and good natured).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117682480">There's a lot about this hotel I didn't like, some that I didn't mind, and the circumstances were not ideal. That is, we didn't choose the place terribly carefully. My wife needed a certain corporate rate for a business trip, she brought the family, we didn't do as much research as we otherwise might for a business-plus-pleasure-bring-the-family trip. First impressions count for a lot, and the Warwick really bit the big one here. I've never stayed anywhere so militant about its check in time, particularly one so slack as 3:00 p.m. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at 11:30 a.m. or so. No room available. We were told to check back in two hours. We came back at 2:15 or so and had to sit until 3:01 to get our room. The front desk staff were not only unconcerned, but barely masked their mild amusement at our inconvenience. The lobby was full of people in the same situation. The lobby was small and beat up, and managed to look like a refugee camp for much of the time we were there. Slow elevators aggravated the conditions. After the abysmal welcome, the mediocre room was rather refreshing. But the plumbing was poor. The faucets mustered barely a trickle, and the tub drain was slow. The TV was a traditional 4:3 job, placed rather low in a console so you can't see it well in the bed, kind of hidden behind your feet. We were on the 5th floor, facing a bus stop, which was hugely noisy. It was as if the room acoustics were tuned to the bus engines. They start running at about 5 a.m. during the week; mercifully later on the weekend. That said. The location is excellent. Convenient to convention center, Pike Place market, waterfront, Seattle Center, and surrounded by worthy restaurants. The bar in the hotel isn't bad. An upscale market across the street gets you all you need (except fresh bread) at nearly any hour. There's a refridgerator in the room. The Cinerama across the street has a cool retro look to it, and there's a view of the Space needle. The street scene is fun to watch. Beyond the few rotten apples at the front desk, the bell and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Consistent with the late check-in time, the noon check-out time is rather generous. The pool/whirlpool is fine for a quick dip, and the gym looked O.K., too. We got the sense that the Warwick does a high-volume tourist business associated with the cruise ship terminals not far away. I suppose the hotel is appropriate for that market; a place to crash before embarking on a cruise or making an airport connection with perhaps a few hours to see a bit of Seattle's sights. The Warwick is definitely not a business class hotel, but perhaps it's unfair to hold it to that standard. Whatever the application, there are no doubt much better places to stay in Seattle. At the right price (a very low one), I would not discourage someone from staying at the Warwick. But I would not recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117675030">We love the location. You are within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and downtown shopping. Easy cab ride to the cruise ship terminals. The staff was very attentive. Nice amenities (restaurant, fitness room and pool). The rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall glass exterior window walls that provide great views. Light sleepers (which we are not) may find these window walls provide the background sounds of the city a little too much. We will return the next time we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117478321">Everytime I read reviews here, for wherever I travel, I hear horror stories and get a little worried and then when I get there I think "What was all the complaining about???' We travelled from Vancouver to Seattle by car with our 7 year old son. WE got room 609 which worried me as it was by the elevators but that was not a problem. We had a room on the 6th floor and although they assured me over the phone (while I reserved,) that it was a NON VIEW room (we paid a very reasonable price and were expecting nothing) we had a view of the Space Needle (wee photo from our room)! While we reserved over the phone they guy on the line said "You are aware this is a non view room???" IF that was a non view room, Im impressed! WE loved looking at the space needle at night. Cool! The room was moderately decorated and very clean. Lots of pillows! Carpets looked brand new. Bathroom was standard and had a kick-butt blowdryer for my long hair. A few hotels near the Warwick were double the price per night and I imagine they were top of the line. This place was great for what we needed it for. The beds were a little soft for my back but the place was spotless and comfy. The noise. Ok, so you are in Seattle in the middle of the city. You will hear sirens, trucks etc. Bring earplugs and you will be just fine. If you are not a light sleeper, the noises are not that bad. If you want complete quiet, go camping in a forest. The location was great. We walked everywhere (with our 7 year old)....the space needle, the market, shopping..... and he never complained that it was "too far". The location of the Warwick is great. The restaurant in the hotel was pricey but good for breakfast. There is a funky deli/market across the street where were would get drinks and cool pastries from. We enjoyed the pool. Again, the complaints on here are silly. You want an olympic sized pool in the heart of Seattle? The pool was nice and warm and clean and I could stay in the hot tub while my son swam because they were adjacent. It was a nice place to go unwind after a day of sightseeing. IF you need to do some hard core laps then it would be too small but for a soak and a small swim it is great. The gym was small too but it was being used and the people in it were sweating and getting a work out. We didnt like that we had to pay $27 a day for parking. That, in my opinion, made the hotel more expensive than they told us it would be. Wondering if all hotels charge for parking?? Liked the free internet in the lobby computer room to quickly check my emails post of facebook :) I would definatley stay at the Warwick again. They just need harder beds for my liking but otherwise it was fantastic. If you are going to the space needle, go to Zeeks Pizza, it was to die for! I love Seattleâ™¥<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117452373">this was my last hotel of my 2 week trip. I wanted to stay in someplace nice....after staying in a college dorm on a hard bed for 1 week. Nice service at front desk. Room had an awesome view of the space needle and downtown. The sunset was beautiful. I wished I could have stayed 2 nights and enjoyed the amenities of the hotel and pampered myself with room service. Great walking thru the city and down to the market. All sorts of food, bars, stores all within steps of the hotel. Gee you don't want to bring a car in town...27 bucks a night for parking! ouch. I saw some places were 36 bucks a night! My room was $179 which I don't normally spend for a room....but splurged. They have a happy hour in the bar restaurant on street level and also a indoor pool with jacuzzi which i would have loved to use. very convenient location. little room off lobby with 2 computers to check internet and print out boarding passes.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116438703">After reading recent reviews including the problems w/ the security officer, I expected less. But I got a Deluxe room via "Best Rate Guaranteed" on the hotel website warwickwa.com and also felt I got the best value for money out of rooms available for Seafair 2011. I also asked for a view of the Space Needle. Also told the hotel I did not want but needed a non-smoking room due to allergies and that my bag I dropped off early in my day please be in my room. Got Room #1107 with the stuff in my room I needed, good work Warwick team! Got to the hotel at about 5:30. Room was very clean, curtains &amp; door to mini-balcony worked very well. View was just spectacular from the room. However, important to note - the Warwick puts a $50 hold on your card for incidentials. I objected and got locked out of the TV, internet &amp; minibar. Not that I care for the minibar and decided that a netbook was just too heavy to haul around versus a complimentary business center in the hotel to check e-mail, but would have been nice to check KING &amp; KIRO when I got up to see the weather report for Seafair. Did though appreciate the complimentary Wolfgang Puck coffee &amp; AC outlet for my camera battery charger. You'll see that in one of the pictures I submitted to this review. Also reserved through the hotel website and a few clicks a seat at breakfast at the hotel restaurant Brasserie Margaux. The country breakfast was great value for money and helped me power through a hot and happily loud Seafair Saturday. Oh and a word about Seattle and transportation... I am disabled w/o enough income for taxis to chaffeur me around everywhere without some mass transit help. On that note: I walked about 3 blocks 4th &amp; Pine for a great conduit at the Westlake Sound Transit light rail station to major attractions like King Street Station, the stadiums, SeaTac Airport, the Museum of Flight, &amp; the next Seafair in 2012. You may need a taxi connection from the light rail conduit - I would recommend Yellow Cab of Seattle (Warwick has the #) or if you have street addresses instead of just destinations then Sitia may work out as well as a backup. Overall, the hotel did very good. Especially the concierge, front desk &amp; restaurant. I am already mentally planning the next trip with this as the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

The front desk staff were very nice, though there was only one person at the desk when we checked in and she was on the phone trying to help a disgruntled guest who wanted to change rooms though they were sold out for the night. They did give us an upgrade and a room with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. The beds were very comfortable. They stored our luggage all day while we went sightseeing. The only problem was that we had no hand towels in our bathroom when we arrived. That night we called housekeeping and they brought some right up.

<comment category="negative" id="UR115593540">The view from the room of the Space Center was nice, the balconies, nice, but overall the price and lack of security makes this hotel, in my opinion one of the most unsafe. We had an issue with an ex s/o continuously finding his ways back into locked rooms after key cards had been changed. Security did a half hearted attempt to look around the room and failed to find the intruder twice. After notification of the front desk the response was not prompt, and only after several completely frightening experiences and numerous phone calls were the police called. The hotel overall is old, so understandably outdated, but the beds were not comfortable and housekeeping not prompt. The happy hour was great, but otherwise the food extremely overpriced for what was served. Because of the situation with the lack of security I was too frightenend to leave my room for the remainder of the trip, resulting in ruining my only free day to explore Seattle. The manager was aware and while apologetic, there was no followup of the result of the lack of security, nor any incentives for us to come back. Just cold reception. Save your money, there are plenty of other hotels in this area that are updated, safer, and offer an equally pleasant view.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115575500">Don't stay at this hotel if you are a non smoker or you book through a travel agent. In fact don't go there at all! We arrived fairly late on Tuesday night and were given our room keys but when arriving in our rooms we found that they were both on the smoking floor and stunk to high heaven of cigarettes. We went back to reception and asked to have our rooms changed only to be told that there were no non smoking rooms available at the price we paid and that if we wanted a non smoking room we would have to pay extra. We were also told that as we had booked through an agent there was no guarantee of room type (i.e. smoking or non smoking) and that this could only be guaranteed if we had book with the hotel directly. Having explained how bad the room was and that as non smokers we could not be expected to sleep in a smoking room we asked to be moved again and it was like banging our heads against a brick wall. All we got from the night duty manager was that it was their policy not to move customers to other rooms free of charge (we were talking $10 difference by the way) and that she understood our problem which clearly she did not. She would not budge and just kept going on about hotel policy and the fact that she would get in trouble if she gave us upgraded non smoking room free of charge. After 20 minutes of complete frustration we reluctantly agreed to pay the extra $10. And what did we get for that $10, well the room was on a higher floor but not as big or nicely laid out as the previous room, my brother ended up with twin beds rather than a double and our room had a bathroom with facilities for a disabled person. Note also a lot of their rooms are on the main road and can be very noisy (we stayed there for 2 nights 2 weeks before when we did get non smoking rooms) but noisy ones.

<comment category="positive" id="UR115530402">I've stayed at the Warwick a lot and am a big fan. The staff are always welcoming (every time I've walked in at 6am with no reservation they've immediately booked me in for the following night, no problem), the narrow balconies all have interesting views and they put me in the same room every time I visit which is really nice. Pros: The location is unbeatable for tourists wishing to shop and check out Seattle's main attractions. The onsite restaurant is truly delicious, albeit expensive (during happy hour at the bar there are some decent deals) and directly across the street from the hotel there is a small grocery with excellent ready to eat dishes (it's open until 2am and a bit pricier than most). Cons: The basement amenities leave something to be desired. The pool is not nearly as sparkling and long as it appears in the photo on the brochure, the fitness center is a bit small and the hot tub is rarely functional. The best thing about the Warwick is the staff, they have a certain cool worldly attitude that you don't tend to see in Seattle. They are neither nosy or disinterested, and respond quickly and appropriately to issues. Our toilet flooded during our stay and they immediately moved us to a nicer room on the 17th floor. Extending your trip here is amazingly easy, they will usually even keep you in the same room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR114831903">We booked our room through Hotels.com and when we arrived the hotel could not locate the booking. They would not give us another room, even though they had availability and made us wait in the lobby for 45-min until they finally located the reservation. They then said they were going to move us to a smoking room and I showed them on my iphone that we had booked a non-smoking room. They said they would not guarantee room type through third parties and if we wanted a non-smoking room it would cost an additional $30 per night. We paid the "upgrade" after they advised they would not give us any other options. It was also clear that the staff had some battle going on as they were not nice with the people checking in or the people that came to the front desk for assistance. The room we received was nice, however we had other options available at the price they charged. Parking was also $27 per night. There are enough hotels in the area that you do not have to stay here.

<comment category="negative" id="UR113824486">I'll say this first - the view of the Space Needle from our room was a 'WOW' and the bed was incredibly comfortable. But - when we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded to one of their "newly remodeled Executive Suites" I was excited, until I saw the room. The carpet, and furniture were new, but they hadn't done anything in the bathroom (door had big chunks missing out of the bottom, faucet had obvious signs of wear, water stains on the marble tile) and, worst of all, the sliding glas door opening to the balcony was so poorly hung, we didn't dare open it again once we got it shut the first time. Additionally - while the floor-to-celing windows provide a great view, they are poorly insulated and the noise coming up from the street during the night made it difficult to sleep - and we were exhausted from our trip. The Warwick is in a great location, but Hotel Andra is right next door and the Warwick suffers in comparison. If the view is most important to you, stay at Warwick; if its the quality of the room, go to Andra.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR113394864">We arrived at the Hotel for a one night stay prior to taking a cruise. Difficult to find anything positive about this hotel. Reception run down and 'tatty' looking. Despite the presence of a concierge/porter there was no offer to help with our bags. As soon as we entered our assigned room we were amazed - and not in a positive way. The bathroom was so small that the washbasin was in the room - even the smallest cabin on the ship (144 sq ft.) managed to get this in the bathroom. The room was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and the sheets were rumpled and appeared not to have been changed since the last occupant. We immeditely booked another hotel by phone and left, informing reception of our dissatisfaction. Even if we had been offered another room we would have not stayed there under any circumstances. I am not usually so negative about reviews but this was the worst place for it's star rating we have ever been in. The 'additional details/ratings' are so sketchy as th hotel was in our opinion so bad we did not actually stay there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112095939">We stayed at the Warwick for two nights after an Alaskan cruise. We stayed there basically because we could get a smoking room. The hotel was only a $15 cab ride from Pier 91 and we arrived at 10.00 am so we went for a walk to the Space Needle which took about 15 minutes slowly. Our room was ready by 12.30 and was great. Naturally there was some smoke smell but we have had worse in supposed non smoking hotels. We were on the ninth floor looking toward the needle. The beds were 5 star standard and we had a bath as well. There is a free computer room downstairs so I din not check out the wifi. There were lots of places to eat nearby and a subway 50 yards away. The staff were very friendly and competent and the concierge Joe knew everything about Seattle. We paid about $150 per night which we thought was very good value. We will be back. We should have stayed three nights as one day was not enough at The Museum of Flight which would be of interest to everybody not just flying enthusiasts.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR111560985">Modern room, good large bed, nice view of the hi-rise city from 14th floor. Sliding glass doors to small balcony allowed fresh air in. Odd layout with 'bathroom' having only bath, shower and wc; no mirror or basin. The washbasin and mirrors are in the bedroom. It felt strange shaving, brushing teeth, etc., in the bedroom, and having no mirror in the bathroom. The double room had only one office-style chair, although there was room for more. WiFi was charged; only 2 free terminals in the "business centre" off the lobby. One was out of order. Good location with several excellent restaurants nearby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR110150599">we walked 4 blocks from the westlake lightrail station too the warwick and had no problem at all finding the hotel. the hotel checked us in within minutes with a freindly welcome and smile. the room was large enough too not feel cramped and the step out balcony was a great benifit. we saw the space needle straight out of our balcony door on the 8th floor. the sitting area with a fire place in the loby was nice and quiet. also the bar had a very freindly and helpful bartender. we did not eat at the resturant on site. the cinama was right across the street and we did not have any problem with any street noise. the only people we saw hanging around the cinama where passengers waiting for the bus. the room was very clean and the bathroom was in good clean condition and everything worked fine. the free ammenities in the bathroom were of good quality and looked new. we had a great nights sleep on the queen comfortable beds with no noise from anything in the hotel. the walk too pikes market and the waterfront was very easy too get too. go straight down lanora street and acroos too pikes street. the walk back was a bit of a struggle with the hill going back up. but that happens with all hotels that are above the hill downtown. a small convenient store was a block away that had the soda and wine we needed too take on the ship. the prices are high but that is too be expected. we got up early and went back down too the market but nothing opens up except the coffee shops untill 9am. so we caught the monorail at the westlake station and went too walk around the space needle. our check out in the morning was quick and easy since we had used the credit card too book the room. a cab ride too pier 91 was $15 plus a gratuity. it was a wonderful place too stay for the night and i will definetely use this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR106479557">Overall this hotel was good, the rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping also keep the rooms in very good clean condition. The bathrooms are a little dated and the water pressure for the showers... well its pretty low... the staff are friendly and there is free internet within the business room downstairs. Although WIFI is not free. Overall, If honest, after an eight day stay at this hotel I may consider a more recently refurbished, new hotel.... this is not to say our time at this hotel was bad, if anything it was very pleasant, but there are little things here and there that could be improved upon (including a luke warm, bubbless jacuzzi).... Overall I would recommend this hotel, but I think with regards to the price, you can get better accommodation in other hotels.<topic>none</topic>

It was difficult choosing amongst several possible Seattle hotels for a one-night stay. We were very glad we chose the Warwick. The person in charge of group reservations was great and had eveything completely ready for us when we arrived, including individual key envelopes with each person's name on it. The check-in took less than 5 minutes. Rooms were clean and spacious, a meeting room was provided and a Starbucks is located just across the street for a quick breakfast.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102834111">This was my 2nd or 3rd stay here, and it's been better each time, and great to start with. It's the location- downtown but also easy walking distance to Seattle Center/Space Needle, Pikes Place, Westwood underground bus station if you want to go to other areas. Beranoya Hall, theaters, restaurants, shopping, monorail, just a great location. Easy to get to. Spotlessly clean. Comfy bed. Juliet balcony with sliding glass door, so it was light and airy. Really nice bath products, deep tub. I like the restaurant, reasonable bill, sensible portions, nice flavors. The surprise gift of a plate of macaroons and mineral water, and lovely turn down service after returning from evenings out made me feel especially well cared for. Parking seems a bit steep, but I think it's comparable to independent lot parking, and it is covered parking. The mini fridge wasn't cold enough, but I've never seen one that is. Highly recommend, hated to leave, will certainly go back!<topic>none</topic>

I can't imagine there's a better deal in downtown Seattle especially if your rate includes parking as ours did.

The service is always great, the rooms are clean (and recently updated) and the location is great - there is a great little grocery store right across the street, and shopping is just a few minute walk down the street. There is a pool/hot tub AND a fitness room, which is a combination that isn't seen too often within hotels. There is also a great restaurant - we got chance to have a great breakfast there with great service and delicious food. I would highly recommend this hotel if you're looking for a fair price, with great service and a good location close to shopping and restaurants.<topic>none</topic>

Most of the time we stayed it would be for an overnight and would stay at other hotels if we were in town longer. My past two visits have been impressive. The recent renovations are fabulous and I highly recommend spending a little more for the new executive rooms.

<comment category="negative" id="UR93477671">We've stayed here many times for lots of good reasons ... friendly staff, great location, easy to get in &amp; out, very reasonable prices. We stayed this time because we had reservations at Jazz Alley, a short walk away. Overall, the hotel is old &amp; tired, but fairly well maintained. The rooms are average, bathrooms are marble (reflecting their age) &amp; pretty small. The ceilings in the bathroom have been lowered in a remodel from the 1960s or so, making them rather claustrophobic. Water pressure was terrible. The TV was in a large cabinet facing the bed, but was so low you had to sit up in the bed to see it. The bed was OK, the towels &amp; sheets were very tired. The sheets were thin &amp; shabby, &amp; there was a hole in the bottem sheet. One thin blanket on the bed -- thank goodness they had a spare in the closet. The towels were similar -- pretty bad. We didn't eat in the restaurant this time, but we did have drinks &amp; dessert in the bar. After 2 drinks I wasn't convinced there was any liquor in them. The dessert was described as multiple layers of chocolate torte. It was a tasteless cold concoction sitting on top of Ready Whip, drizzled with raspberry syrup. Terrible. The bartender nicely took it off our tab. All &amp; all, we've decided the low price is just not worth it, &amp; next time we'll stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

It was excellent! However I would have to agree that the rooms are noisy and drafty. Not really anyones fault but the sound does indeed travel somehow upwards. for the price this was a great deal and we think a great location between belltown and downtown, all walking distance. housekeeping was very poor, which would be our only 'easy fix' negative comment<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR90408756">The hotel is located on the outer edge of central Seattle on a very safe street; the staff is very customer oriented; the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. OK, what was wrong? The window wall is two sets of sliding glass doors that admit lots of street noise and serious drafts- on a cold, rainy night that was a big negative. The room's decor was black and gold, circa 1972 vintage Holiday Inn- gross, dated and depressing. The hallways were worse. In fairness to the hotel, they are in the process of renovating. In fairness to you, understand that a 'standard' room is a to be avoided, unrenovated room. Based on my view of the public areas and my room, I would rate the hotel 2 stars. Having experienced it, I would pay a lot more money to stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

When i got to the room it wasn't the cleanest, had sort of a strange smell, not to mention the towells that told tales of previous "male body fluid" stains. The white curtains had obvious brown stains on it and all in all it looked like they tried to remodel it but it's more like putting lipstick on a pig. I also heard random banging on the wall like other reviewers, sounds were speratic and random. Service was good and everyone was really nice but all and all i wouldnt go back...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR82928037">Even though we arrived late at night, the staff of the Warwick was courteous and helpful. We had a glitch with one of the room keys, but it was quickly resolved. The only downside was the musty smell of the room upon arrival. After opening the sliding door to the outside, the mustiness was gone and was a non-issue. The balcony was standing room only, no room for a chair. The hotel offered us a perfect view of the Space Needle both at night and during clear days. The Warwick was an easy walk to delicious restaurants and attractions. There was no need to rent a car. The Link Light Rail brought us all the way from the airport to between two and three blocks away. Even at the late hour we arrived, it was an easy jaunt. The public transportation in Seattle and surrounding areas brought us within blocks of the hotel, with one bus stop right across the street! The grocery store across the street was convenient for any meal, but especially breakfast and a late night snack. After a long day of walking downtown, the hot tub brought relief to tired muscles. An early morning swim in the small pool reawakened the muscles for another day of excursion. We would stay at the Warwick Seattle again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR82612182">We arrived at the Warwick Hotel on September 24, 2010 for a weekend stay. Staff was all very friendly and helpful, but room was a tremendous disappointment. Very dated, uncomfortable beds and not up to standard for cleanliness. Our "Space Needle" view room also overlooked the roof of the theatre next door and all its HVAC units - not attractive at all, but Space Needle was in the distance. Worst part was the noise from the street both nights we stayed - people yelling and whistling; honking horns; etc. until after 3am both nights. It was reasonably convenient to most sites, but in the middle of the monorail route - would have been better to stay on one end or the other to make travel easier. I would not stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

I am not sure what was making the thumps.... elevator, cleaning, etc? In addition the outside traffic was very loud even though we were on the 5th floor. The bathroom was not clean, I found brown strands of hair in the bathtub and the sink.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR81836659">More than once the keys to our room failed to work and had to be reprogrammed. At one point the hotel staff gave us a lesson on electronic keys as if they were talking to five year olds. The bathtub was dirty. There were used toiletries in the tub, complete with someone else's hair stuck to them and the bottom of the tub. When housekeeping arrived to take care of the issue she didn't knock when entering the room and then proceeded to tell us she had already cleaned the bathroom. She then removed the used items, after they were pointed out, and simply rinsed the hair out of the tub. That is not cleaning. The location of this hotel is decent. It's walking distance to just about everything downtown has to offer and if you can't walk there it puts you a short distance from all public transportation. We did have a great view of the Space Needle, but even that isn't enough to make up for poor customer service and lack of cleanliness. I debated chaning hotels all together, but there were several big events in Seattle that weekend and I wasn't going to be able to get another room on such short notice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81687575">When we originally booked our trip to Seattle we only booked the first night at the Warwick (as it was a bit cheaper), but when we arrived I was really impressed. The hotel itself doesn't exactly look amazing from outside but the staff were really friendly on arrival and our room was brilliant. It seemed really big (I don't know if this is just an American thing) and we had a prefect view of the Space Needle. The other side of the hotel faces downtown so whichever side you're on the view should be alright. We were really tired after our flight but we did venture downstairs to the bar / restaurant for a few drinks before bed. Again the staff were really friendly and the food in the restaurant looked good (although we didn't actually have anything). The prices all seemed pretty reasonable. The following morning we were off to get on our cruise to Alaska and would be coming back to stay in the Fairmont Olympic one week later. In all honesty, even though the Fairmont was a 5 star hotel, I would have quite happily just gone back to the Warwick, it definitely had everything we needed. The location is pretty good, most things are easily in walking distance - especially the restaurants and shops of downtown. Pike street market is only about 5 minutes away and I would definitely recommend you give that a visit.<topic>none</topic>

The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The only downside for me was the walk from the Monorail station back to the hotel after dark, which is not the hotel's fault.

Finally get the room key, to find out on top of the over $200 / night stay I had to pay an additional $30 just to park over night in their garage! Being as it was an hour wait to get the key, my husband had already been directed to park the car, on level 6, with no elevator, so when i got out of the line we had to walk up 7 floors empty our car and carry ALL of it down the stairs to take to our room! Even though I was told "valet" parking and luggage would be included in the price of parking. Get to our room, the key did not work. Thankfully there were 2, and the other did. The room was ok. The furniture and bed was nice, SMALL old tv, nasty bathroom, and it a constant "buzzing" sound from the water running on the floor above us. Got zero sleep. Paid nearly $300 to spend less than 10 hours in a loud, dirty hotel with NO extras. No coffee in room, no refridgerator in room (other than the locked mini bar fridge), No continental breakfast, over all: So not worth it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR72593549">We booked our room via Warwick's website. It was the lowest price in this location...and the location is wonderful! Walking distance to absolutely everything you could possibly want to do - or if not, you could catch public transportation to get wherever you want to go! We arrived very early in the AM - post-cruise. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. She went the extra mile to get us a room and allowed an early check in! Fantastic, as we certainly didn't expect it! The hotel has an historic elegance, our bed was very comfortable, room was clean and quiet - in-room mini-bar fridge didn't work. They offered free internet access in their business center - so, we were able to check in and print our boarding passes for our flight home. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with any and all questions that we asked. Concierge assisted beautifully in booking a town car to the airport for us. I would highly suggest using the town car service. It's not much more than the shuttle service - and you don't have to lug your own suitcases. The driver was extremely punctual, professional and courteous. I have read on TripAdvisor of other people encountering difficulties with shuttle service, etc not being on time and such - so, definitely need to do the town car via the concierge! All in all - a very nice stay, though I would say we usually do not stay in hotels that are in this price range...but, it is just the price of staying in this area of Seattle. It's very close to Pike Place Market and lots of great shopping - and that is definitely worth something!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR72189263">We hit Seattle late (5 in the evening), and tried a few places, landing at the Warwick, an old friend. It is simply sad. Our room was not well-kept (a beer bottle cap on the floor; grout in the bathroom was filthy; furniture and coverlet with stains); the balcony door was left open; the mattresses had long since seen better days. Given the extraordinary cost of parking ($27, plus tax), there are so many less expensive options in the area which offer as much if not more. We must say a permanent adieu to any future stays. The only plus? the charming restaurant.<topic>none</topic>

Yes, the pool is the size of a postage stamp. Can't comment on the breakfast because we're a little cheap so we walked across the road to Ralph's deli. Clean, comfortable air-conditioned rooms in a faded-elegance way, good bathrooms, friendly helpful staff, good location with a bus stop right outside. Good beds and linens. Our 11th floor room had a great view of the needle. What's not to like? We paid via Trailfinders, booked it before the start of the holiday, so not sure what we paid compared to other people, but we thought it was good value for money.

<comment category="positive" id="UR70749529">We stayed for some days, and came back on the last day despite plans to go to an airport hotel. I had been there before on a business trip, but somehow this time, it was even better. The breakfast was incredible. The comfort of our room was great for the price. The view of the needle was great. The staff was helpful. We could use the internet facility without problems. If we had a problem, the staff came up with a solution - a nearby jazz club, a good shop to buy x or y... Helpful and knowledgable concierge and reception staff. We enjoyed the gym and the pool. We were particularly impressed with the way in which our larger group - a party of family and friends - were accommodated, even when there were changes of plan. Transport with a bus or the tram to the airport was simple. Nice shops close by. If I could suggest one improvement, I would say the shower is a bit tricky to figure out... but that was all.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR69219644">Located downtown, a few blocks from Pike's Place Market. Entrance does not have automatic doors, and there's no one to help with bags and luggage in the evening. Front desk staff was friendly and gave us a tourist map. Concierge would only give detailed directions and advice when face-to-face and not when calling from the hotel room phone. Room was spacious and had a great view of the Space Needle. Curtains were old and stained. Bed was fairly comfortable and had nice linens. Temperature control and air conditioning were in good working condition. Bathroom did not have a fan, so all the mirrors were fogged up for a long time after a shower. The shower head was installed low, so tall people would have to bend over to wash their hair. Shampoo, soap, body wash, and lotion were provided. Closet contained functional iron and ironing board. Also had a very small in-room safe. The old TV had some trouble responding to the remote control. The mini-fridge/bar required a key from the front desk, and if you wanted to store your own items, you had to rearrange the items within the bar (even with rearrangement, very little space for your own things). No microwave. Housekeepers came in daily to make the bed and hang up the towels, but other than that, did not do much cleaning. Overall, decor was outdated, and furnishings need some updating. Wireless internet cost $11/day. Complimentary business center with 2 computers and a printer. Restaurant was very pricey ($10 for juice, coffee, and a pastry) and had no bathroom. Touted itself as a higher-end hotel but really needed some more updating and better amenities. You can definitely hear the buses and trucks going by (even above the 10th floor), so if you are a light sleeper, beware. Also, although the room was a non-smoking room, the vents must be connected to a smoking room, because I smelled smoke one morning in the bathroom.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR67217618">At 11:30am on 5-18-10 while traveling from San Francisco to Seattle on a important business trip, I learned my Father was suddenly rushed to ICU in South Florida. I immediately e-mailed Warwick Hotel to let them know of my situation and that I would need my room ready ASAP once I arrive. Warwick Hotel assured me my room would be ready and even said Mr. James Harker, General Manager, would promptly inform all his staff. After 2pm I arrived at the Warwick &amp; my room was Not Ready nor was any of the Warrick Staff informed. Mr. Harker was unavailable. I then told Mr. Robert Smartt, Reservations Manager, who was the most cold, uncaring, inhospitable hospitality worker I ever met of my situation. He never once expressed any concern for me while scrounging up a room. My father passed away on 5-20-10, my final day at Hotel Warwick. I let Robert Smart know that except for housekeeping, to give me some privacy. That early afternoon I went to an Internet Cafe to make flight reservations back to Florida as both Warrick Hotel computers were inoperable. I got back at 4pm &amp; my room was still never made up. The entire Warwick Hotel Staff, with the exception of Dionne, never expressed any condolence or sympathy towards me.<topic>none</topic>

(many, many moons ago), Where can you send the yoga concious,vegan and finicky relations? Answer: Warwick Seattle! And yes, we are still speaking. They loved the room, pool, fitness center, proximity to the light-rail, service and price. As I have used them frequently, I was happy to reccomend and pleased to hear that conditions are as I remember them.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR62635692">First impression was scarred by their valet parking attendant. He was driving a car in reverse at a speed higher than necessary and almost removed the front end of our car. Further moments of not being impressed were numerous stains on the curtains and bedcovers, internet access at $11 per day, movies at $13.99 each, cable channels were not coming in except the news, parking was additional $27/day, had to request housekeeping service by phone and it was already 4pm in the afternoon, noise from the steet is loud at all hours due to the METRO stop right outside the window, and to top it all off, the food at their lounge and restaraunt is so expensive 2 of us ate for $140 with 1 bottle of cheap wine and we shared our dessert, other nearby establishments were reservations recommended or 45 minute wait to eat/drink. The only good thing about the hotel was the pool was warm and the location is good for walking to attractions.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR61851133">My company booked me at the Warwick for a recent business trip. This was my first trip to Seattle, so I really had no idea what to expect. What I liked about the hotel: comfortable bed and pillows, really tasty food options for room service, cabs parked outside for easy/quick transportation, accessible by Gray Line from airport, professional staff, view of Space Needle. What I didn't like: no fridge/microwave in room, small bathroom, vending machines available only in basement, $11/day unsecured almost-never-functional WiFi, insufficient sound barrier for street noise (even though I was 16 floors up) and adjoining room, no fan to create white noise at night, location was too far from touristy stuff to walk to it (at least as a woman alone). I ventured out one night to find dinner, and was no more than two blocks away before I was greeted by the city's homeless population... ended that journey pretty quickly. Overall, I thought the hotel was decent, and I wouldn't mind staying here again, but my preference would be to stay someplace a few blocks south where all the tourist stuff seems to be.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR61617536">The Warwick Seattle is in the heart of Seattle so itâ€™s a 20-30 minute walk from everything! Took us 25 minutes to walk back after a Mariners game and Monday to Friday you can hop on the bus for free! Lots of cruise people are complaining about check in time and check out time. Hello universal check in time is 3:00pm and check out 11:00am or 12noon!!!!! Most hotels (especially cruise hotels) let you purchase an early check-in and no its not a cash grab its because every one getting off your boat is asking for early check-in as well so this fairest way to allocate this. I found the staff to find the right answers they were in no way 5 diamond but were professional, management were just a little aloof but all in all nothing to complain about. The rooms have been recently updated we received a room on the top floor facing the Space Needle breathtaking view and very well appointed room. The pool and fitness floor is far from luxurious but itâ€™s there and clean. Depending on your rate this hotel can be a great deal as long as the rate youâ€™re paying isnâ€™t any more than younger higher recognized properties you will in now way bee disappointed with you stay!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR60818817">I stayed four nights in the Warwick in April 2010, travelling from Germany. My requirtements for the hotel were simple: 1) clean, and even cleaner, 2) close to downtown, 3) reasonably priced. The hotel achieved full marks in all departments. My room was very clean, especially the bed and bathroom area. And I am fussy about these things. The hotel is just on the edge of downtown, 3 minutes walk to Macy's, 10 Minutes to Pike St. Market. The "Downtown Airporter" express bus service to SEA-TAC Intl. stops at the hotel (on 3rd. Ave.) every 30 Minutes - perfect and at 11$ much cheaper than the cabs at $45. The price is very reasonable for the area. However, the Warwick is not a hotel you visit because you want to spend time in the hotel proper. It is very much somewhere where you sleep and shower, maybe watch a bit of TV or check your emails. I would stay there again, but only if travelling alone. I wouldn't bring a family here, not a hotel for hanging out in. The furnishings were several years old, and showed their age. The bathroom was smallish, nothing chipped or cracked, but nothing new either. For example, the shower / bath tap (faucet) worked perfectly well, if you found just the right position to balance the settings on. The TV cabinet (huge) was neither pretty, quite worn, but entirely utilitarian. The big window out on to the very tiny (20cm) balcony didn't shut tightly, causing quite some draughtiness. The air conditioning / heating worked exceptionally well and balanced out the draught from the window nicely. The staff were effiicient and courteous - perfect. All in all a very acceptable, no fuss, no th(fr)rills, competent and efficient - if aging - hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR58639237">I stay in downtown Seattle several times each year in one of several hotels which are within a few blocks of each other. So, location is not a factor. This weekend we booked at the last minute and couldn't get in at any of our normal hotels, so booked a night at the Warwick because the price appeared right and the reviews were good. I am not picky. I am actually quite content to stay at a decent Motel 6. However, this was one of my worst lodging experiences, and I have done a lot of traveling. Let me preface the review by stating that you can have a worse experience by staying at hotels/motels for half the price. I just expect that an establishment that charges for rooms starting in the mid-100s will have a few things right. OK, here is what I liked: - The location was fine. It was right within a few blocks of pretty much everything downtown. - The ambience was good. It is a nice-looking older hotel. - The room was sized a bit on the smallish side, but more or less as expected. - The price was good (though better value can be had downtown at other hotels). - When I booked online, I was given a dollar amount with tax. This is EXACTLY what appeared on my bill. This is usually not the case. - The deal we got included parking (which can be a big deal in downtown Seattle). That's a good thing because parking there is $27 a day. Here is what I didn't like: - Check-in was rough. I had booked online through Warwick's own website, but it took 15-20 minutes and a phone call to the reservations manager for them to find our reservation. Not a huge deal. I realize these things happen. - Internet access was an additional $11 per day. Frankly, I would have rather them charge $11 more for the room and throw in internet access for free. Paying extra for internet access didn't sit well with me for a hotel of this sort. - The TV had about 8-10 local channels, and that was all. Anything else was extra. I have seen this before, but usually only in a low-end hotel/motel. - They put us on the third floor (very near the street noise), about 15 feet from the elevator, and right next to an adjoining room with a screaming baby. OK, I get that they were near full capacity, but we couldn't have had a much worse room. - I am not a light sleeper, but hardly slept all night from the street noise. The sound insulation of the windows near street-level needs to be upgraded. We found very little sound difference whether the window was opened or closed - and it is a noisy street. - Both of our beds had a strange short fitted sheet that didn't cover the whole bed. This left our feet to rest directly on the mattress. Very odd. - After finally getting to sleep, housekeeping showed up very early and woke us up. - Under the light of day, I found red stains here and there (on the curtain, mattress, etc.) At first, these appeared as blood, but I realized they were ink or paint. Still, not pleasant to find. I have spent about 200 nights in hotels and motels, and can count the experiences I consider negative on one hand. This was one of them. The hotel itself was OK. I think that the experience may largely depend on the room selection. We got a terrible room, but I don't have the impression that all rooms were that bad. Still my recommendation is to stay at any of the comparably priced hotels within a few blocks of the Warwick. They are all better deals.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR58421378">The Warwick was so much cheaper then all the other hotels we considered in downtown Seattle. We were skeptical, but it had great reviews, so we booked. The Warwick truly is an awesome deal! Very nice looking on the inside, rooms are nicely decorated, and views of the Space Needle are an extreme value for money! The Warwick is within walking distance of pretty much everything. Even the monorail is close...oh and Macy's! The parking is expensive, but I believe this is the case in all downtown hotels within large cities. We loved everything about the Warwick, with the exception of the high speed internet...its not free...they tried to charge over $10 per day for it! Honestly, this is so common now...this should be an included amenity at all hotels. Even Super 8 offers it for free! Other then that we loved the Warwick and will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR58308722">The Warwick Seattle is a great value for a hotel in downtown Seattle. The hotel public areas and hotel rooms are clean and decent. The building has been kept up in good shape as have the rooms. Higher floors get some view of the city or the Space Needle, depending on which way you face. After two stays here I've found the staff friendly and very accommodating.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR58082514">My husband and I took a last minute trip to Seattle and found a low rate for the Warwick on Hotels.com. I had read mixed reviews before we left but being that it was noted as a 3 1/2 star hotel in a great location, we decided to check it out. We were uncomfortable from the first moment we walked in. The lobby, elevators, and room were a mix of mold, body odor, and smoke smells. The location was not as great as we expected - most other downtown hotels (Westin, Sheraton, Marriott) are closer to Pike Place Market, Aquarium, Pier 59, Pioneer Square, etc. The bathroom floor and shower tiles were cracked and the grout was covered in mold. The worst part was that there was not a mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were very thin, so you felt like you were sleeping directly on an old mattress. We asked for extra sheets each night to cover the bed and give it more padding just so we could sleep. This hotel is older, poorly maintained, and overall disappointing. My suggestion - get a 4-star hotel on Hotwire.com in the downtown/Pike Place area. It probably won't cost much more.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR56818581">We found this hotel on the internet after doing some research for a hotel with a good location in Seattle. We didn't want to rent a car so the location of this hotel was great. We were able to walk to Pike's, the Needle and all sorts of restaurants and shopping. By the way, there is an excellent italian restaurant just a half block up from the Warwick, Assaggio's, it's a must do! But for $88/night we got a room with a city view on the 15th floor. They even accommodated us to be right across the hall from family members who we met there for the weekend. The decor is a little dated and it could use some updating. But we had one of the best experiences there with the friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR56722752">I had read in the reviews that rooms that they allocate for some "best-rates" in the internet can face a wall. This is exactly what happened to us in our weekend get-away. We booked our room on expedia for 99$ and we were given a room on the 4th floor which they said was a "corner room": facing the wall of the parking garage next door. Well, we had to go and ask for another room and we did get another one on the sixth floor, this time, facing not the wall of the garage, but the garage itself.. So, it might be better to spend a bit more and get a Space needle view room. Otherwise as you check in you might want to ask for a room on level 7 or above. Otherwise, the hotel staff was helpful and they did end up changing our room. The room itself was clean and spacious enough. The bathroom was also nice, it was all marble. No mini-bar but a refrigerator if you want to keep some food in there. Walking distance to pretty much everything unless you are lazy. And if you are lazy, there is always a cab waiting in front of the hotel for a 5 bucks ride to Space Needle. They charge $11 for using the internet (24 hours period). So, if you can avoid one of those rooms facing the wall (levels 4 and 5) or almost at the same level with the parking garage (level 6) then you should be fine. We would probably stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR56661559">Seattle has lots of terrific 4-star Hotel choices. The Warwick just isn't one. The rooms all have balconies (11 inches of standing space for a late-night cigarette), nice sheets and marble baths. Those are the pros. The hotel is also conveniently located downtown. On the down side, the hotel is astonishingly dirty, worn and tired. I'm not a princess, but the abundant food/liquor/coffee/barf stains on the furniture and carpet throughout the common areas are overwhelming. The walls themselves are grimy, in the elevator, in the halls and to some degree in the rooms. The service staff exemplifies this same description: worn and tired. They are all nice enough, but they have little reason to be especially enthusiastic about the product their representing. For some reason it has been given a 4 star rating by SOME entity that clearly has never been there. It is completely sub-par at that level of expectation, but to its credit, if you're a tourist in Seattle, on a budget, looking for convenience and an 11 inch balcony, then bring your anti-bacterial wipes and stay at the Warwick.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR55725956">While it may not be the most hip, luxurious hotel in Seattle, I found the Warwick Hotel to be an amazing value for the money. I got a great deal on their website and found the location to be perfect. About 3 blocks up from Pike Place market, you can walk to everything from this hotel. There is even an airport shuttle that picks up from this location to get you back to the airport for $11. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was slightly dated but beds and bath were excellent. The only problem that I had with this place was that the sliding doors are older and let in cigarette smoke from below and sounds from the street. If the person had not been on their tiny balcony having a cigarette, I don't think this would have been an issue. Overall, it is an amazing value for the money. I even left a power cord in my room by accident and one call to the hotel put me in touch with the lost &amp; found dept. They packaged up my power cord and had it delivered to my door step in MA in only two days! Now that's service. I would definitely stay here again. There is even a pool, spa and workout room that all looked very nice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53937185">First off, you rarely see marble like this in Hotels anymore. It reminded me of a nice boutique hotel we stayed in, in Athens, Greece. Maybe being from New Orleans I have learned to appreciate the preservation of things built well. The hotel is within walking distance of everything in the downtown area. The staff was great and upgraded us to a room with a view of the space needle which is a perfect view from the Warwick. I love the fact that you can open the big sliding glass doors to the outside something else you rarely see in a Hotel anymore, windows that open! Other places were much more expensive I'm glad I picked the Warwick.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53908009">I have stayed at the Warwick for many years. It is very well priced for all that you get. Location is excellent. Close to everything. The staff always goes above and beyond. The food is fantastic, most rooms have a great view. We always get a room looking directly at the Space Needle. If you smoke they are one of the few hotels left that allows smoking. Which in all fairness to the smokers, I believe that it is your right to smoke and if you are paying the price for a room, they should all have smoking rooms available. Equal rights, we all know that Seattle prides it self on that .. The Warwick is the best value for the price in all of Seattle. It is true that the parking is 27 dollars, but there is a public lot across the street. Most hotels in the area charge more then that. They have a very nice pool and spa area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to our city.As for the noise, all hotels in the city have noise. That is just the way it is in the city. Sirens and buses.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR50819586">I am fairly picky when identifying hotels to stay at, and I spent an inordinate amount of time critically investigating the options for the downtown Seattle area. Thus on this trip my wife and I decided to try the Warwick, even though there were some negative reviews on some of the travel web-sites, there were more positive reviews. During and after our stay, my wife and I fully agreed that we were extremely satisfied with our stay. There was absolutely nothing that could have justified any level of dissatisfaction. The room was immediately upgraded at check-in due to the scheduled room not being ready, the room itself was quite comfortable, immaculately kept, and had a very impressive view, the entire staff was extremely helpful and pleasant, the food in the restaurant was great, and the central location was perfect for our entertainment events, my meetings, and the close-in walk around option to all of downtown.

The hotel is within walking distance of Pikes Place, Shopping and public transportation. We were warmly greeted by staff and enjoyed the meal that we had there the first night. The restaurant staff was awesome and the food was the best I've ever had! Our room was on the 9th floor (smoking) with a fabulous view of the Space Needle. Expect to hear normal city noise while staying downtown. We didn't really mind it at all. The lobby and the restaurant we beautiful. There are 3 elevators so it is a quick trip going up. The bellhops are attentive and eager to help. The room was nice, not high quality, but nice. We had everything that we needed and it was clean. The small balcony was nice to have and the floor to ceiling windows allowed us to fully enjoy the view. We were very comfortable in this hotel. The stay was mostly nice except for the last night when the room next to us got rowdy. The hotel staff took care of the situation and compensated us in the morning. My only suggestion would be to add microwaves to the rooms so that a person can reheat their leftovers and coffee. I will stay there again and look forward to another visit!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR49291043">The Warwick is an average hotel in a great location. The service is always very good; the rooms are very average - nothing terrible, just an "old" feel to everything. Like the hotel could use a great makeover someday soon! But it's located directly across the street from my offices (I live in Denver but my company is based here in Seattle). You've got the view of the Space Needle, a "smoking" floor, and very good service. The downstairs restaurant, Margaux, is very good, too. I could stay at other hotels when I'm in town, but they're all more expensive and further away from "work." So I usually opt for the Warwick. Most times I have a cheese and fruit tray waiting on me upon arrival. So it's a comfortable business alternative. Not sure I'd recommend it for vacationing families, though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR48830935">My wife and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle the night of November 7th. The rooms are pretty nice, but the walls are not good for sound proofing. In the room next door, the guests there had 3 LOUD quarrels that kept us up. Apparently, the police were called and at 4:15AM they finally quieted. While the hotel is not to blame for their quarrel, they should at least have tried to make it up to the guests that were inconvenienced. Thinking that they would at least apologize was my thought, but no such luck. When i brought it up to the desk clerk at check out, she merely agreed that it was loud and sent us on our way.

<comment category="positive" id="UR41314904">We picked the Warwick due to it's location on the Grayline airport schedule and the hotel price. Once there I was overwhelmed by the level of service. We checked in early so the room wasn't ready. I expected that. It was very early. The gentlemen that stored our luggage was vey helpful. He asked if we had plans for the day, then proceded to supply us with maps and other literature. He became our personal ambassador to his city. We found a similar level of helpfullness from all personel we interacted with. It was a wonderful treat to stumble into such great service when we picked the hotel based on location and price. One note about the Grayline. We picked the Warwick because it is he last pick up on the route back to the airport. This turned out to be a problem. 2 or 3 busses filled up before they reached us and went on to the airport. Had I not already purchased Grayline I would have taken a cab. Warwick employees called Grayline to find out what the problem was. Not many hotels would do that for you!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR40256835">I booked this hotel through hotwire. It was the first time I have used them to book a hotel. I received a rate of $156 including fees and taxes. I found the front desk staff nice and friendly. They were having issues getting the rooms keys working with the computer system so she had the bell hop show me to my room and let me in. The room was very dreary and faced a large cement wall. The bedding looked like it was from the 1970's or from a Thrift Store. I walked went back to the front desk and spoke to the friendly woman and asked if all the rooms are like this. She said that because I booked with Hotwire - Hotwire only gets certain rooms, but she switched me to a different room and said to book directly with them to ensure a nicer room. This room was higher level with views of the Space Needle. I enjoyed the view. The bedding was the same as the previous room still the Thrift Store feel. The fitness center is good, 1 nice ellyptical, treadmill, stair climber and bike. They do have a pool but I did not use it. I did like the location and it was close to shopping and the Space Needle. I guess if you need a budget hotel stay here. I love the Inn at Harbor Steps and my husband likes the Alexis Hotel. Bigger price difference but the rooms are so much nicer. My husband stayed at the Alexis for just over $200 including taxes and fees and I think it is worth the difference.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39274473">My husband stayed here for three nights, I was here for two, and we both walked away thinking it was the right choice. Our room on the 3rd floor had a VERY small (walk out, but couldn't turn around) balcony that overlooked the Space Needle, which was beautiful at night. The hotel also has their hotel offices on the 3rd floor (right outside of our room) which seemed a little odd but it didn't disturb us at all. The king-sized bed had four pillows plus an accent pillow, and there was a comfy chair in the corner as well as a desk and chair. As others have mentioned the location is great, within walking distance to all major attractions. The front desk staff were helpful but we did notify them - twice - that our coffee pot was not operational yet no one ever came to replace/repair it (perhaps they were thinking who would really want to drink coffee in a hotel room in Seattle?!;). The grocery store across the street was very nice, but pretty expensive. Would highly recommend Assaggio's Restaurant just outside of the hotel. Nice hotel, would recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

I had requested Ivey to put them in a room with a view of the Space Needle if at all possible. She was still there when they checked in and she gave them a room with a beautiful view of the Space Needle (thank you Ivey). They were thrilled with their accommodations. The room was very nice, clean and quiet. They added an extra night to the original reservation because it was such a nice place to stay at a very reasonable rate. The hotel is within walking distance to many attractions. No need to use the truck the entire time they were there. My grandson took advantage of the onsite amenities (pool and workout room). They ate at the onsite restaurant yesterday morning and said the food was very good.

When we arrived, we confirmed the latter, and reiterated verbally "and that is non-smoking, right?" to Ivy, the receptionist. For reason I cannot fathom, she ignored my statement and gave me "the last room available" which was on the smoking floor. The hotel was also full of partiers, and I spotted four of them going into the adjacent room, which is a recipe for disaster on top of the pervasive stale smoke. Ivy was so helpful to find us another room at another hotel, we said great, make this happen and she so kindly informed us "well, here's the number, you can call and make a reservation" -- they were not going to help us in anyway. The attitude was arrogant and indifferent. They just fell back to the fact that we were lowlife Hotwire customers and there was nothing they needed to do about it. The two minutes I spent in the room while waiting for my husband to finish parking the car (before he knew about this fiasco), I was completely unimpressed by everything but the view. Old World Charm? If you like slow elevators, maybe. I thought we were due for a Langham-type experience, and it was a complete let-down. Totally overhyped. One positive - location. That's it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR35668538">I reserved a room with two beds. They did not have a room with two beds, despite the written confirmation. "Robert Smart" the person with whom I spoke in Seattle, said there was no availability AT THE TIME I MADE THE RESERVATION. He implied it was somehow my fault because I made the reservation only 2 1/2 days in advance. He was unapologetic and argumentative. When I called the off-site reservation center -- IN BRAZIL- they, too were no help. So, even if you have a written confirmation for "Room type: classic double beds", it's not necessarily so.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35430241">Rooms and rates were perfect. Dining room was excellent, but a little overpriced, however, this is a full service hotel. Front desk personnel were very pleasant and helpful, but a little unprofessional at times. For the dollar, it is a great and convenient location and extremely close to all attractions and the port. I had stayed in this hotel some 15 years ago, and I am glad I returned.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35373258">Overall - EXCELLENT! Me and a friend stayed at the Warwick for two nights to sight-see in Seattle before moving on to Vancouver. When we arrived the gentleman at the front desk was really helpful in helping us park the car and even offered us valet service, however the lady that checked us in I felt could've been a little bit more welcoming but dont see this as a major detriment of the hotel - purely a reflection on her own personality! The room was ready on arrival which seems to be a rareity when reading some of the other reviews, however ours was lovely and clean with freshly made beds, tea and coffee making facilities and bottles of water available (at an additional cost but the thought was there!) We also had a breath taking view of Seattle which only got better as the evening set in as the Space Needle lit up and looked amazing! The location of the hotel was GREAT as a starting point for sight seeing! If you turn left out the main entrance and then turn left again at the corner you will come to a stop for the city's open top bus tour! It cost us approximately $20 for the ticket but I think that could possibly have been a two day pass! Whatever it was it was excellent value as the tour takes you all around Seattle and if you have limited time like we did then it is a good idea to do this! You can also jump off the bus at the designated stops to explore that area further if you wish at no extra cost when getting back on later. Also if you turn right out of the hotel and left onto 4th then right again at Virginia Street and carry on walking it takes you right to the sea front and to Pike Place Market - the walk takes approx 10 - 15 mins but it's really nice - especially if you are fortunate to get hot weather like we did! On our return from sightseeing we took advantage of the free swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil and the facility is really well maintained. There are towels down there and chairs where you can just relax. It was also very secluded so it felt like your own personal space which was fantastic! There was also a gym facility however we didnt use that but from the outside it looked ok. Finally on check-out the receptionist (a different one) was very friendly and helpful making checkout easy. Also the night before I had wanted to send a postcard home however the first receptionist's knowledge of where I could buy a stamp/post my card was very very minimal. Upon checkout the new receptionist was very helpful in advising me they would take care of the postage of my card for the charge of $1 and also offered me some complimentary postcards advertising Seattle and The Warwick with free postage that they would sort out for me... needless to say I took advantage of this and sent quite a few home to various members of my friends and family!! Overall I had a lovely experience and would definitely go back again if I was ever over in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33886277">We stayed for four nights last April 2009. My husband cancelled our previous hotel because he found a good rate at this one. I was a little suspicious but was very well satisfied with this hotel. It was situated very well between many key attractions (Pikes Market, all upscale shopping and Space needle were both within walking distance). We had a great view of Space Needle from our room and although there was no breakfast at the hotel there was an awesome doughnut place that was fun, unique, reasonable and right by the hotel. There is also a grocery directly across the street. The most unexpected bonus was the Cinerama across the street. It is the only one left in the U.S. and it was such a nice treat for our family. It played first run movies, but we saw Little Shop of Horrors. It is not to be missed and I would recommend it to anyone going to Seattle. We don't see movies on vacation but the experience of this one is not to be missed. The only consideration is the Ladies shelter located a couple blocks away. We were never approached or anything but we did see a few aimless women hanging around the grocery store directly across the street..again, not a problem but should be mentioned. I would stay in this hotel again. If you are unsure what area of seattle you want to stay in this hotel is perfect...close to everything but not committed to any one area. We did not need our car for this trip (and we had it).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33419378">Arrived early couldn't check in, room unavailable not cleaned yet. Waited past 3:20 P.M. Room still not ready. Booked room back in March. When room became available the floor was not vacuumed, bathroom shower was broken and leaking. One of the double beds did not have a complete sheet on the bottom. Can't believe that they renovated back in 2006; stains on the carpets in room and hallway, they must have forgotten the 3rd floor. View of the run down movie theater was our "Spectacular View" from bedroom. Front desk staff not accommodating and hospitable. I had to get one of the managers to check and see what was holding up the house keeping staff when we were trying to check in. When they cleaned the room the next day they forgot to leave clean towels. We had three adults and an infant staying and only one towel left between us. This was<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR32149788">I was hesitant to stay at this hotel due primarily to the mixed reviews...I should have followed my instinct. The front desk was nice and pleasant enough although our room was not ready at the check-in time due to a late check-out in the room we were originally assigned to. When we finally got to check in (not the room they originally had blocked for us for obvious reasons) we found it to be nothing spectacular. There was a beautiful view of the Space Needle (which we paid additional for) however the rooms were dated and not the cleanest. The rooms were obviously well used with stains on the furniture and bedspread. The bathrooms were small and funky...a suspended ceiling in the bathroom with stained ceiling tiles...I am 5'3" and I could have easily touched the ceiling. I am in the hotel business and we have a saying...your hotel can be tired or old, but this is not an excuse for dirty. We purchased our room through Expedia and honestly there were other hotels that were more upscale than the Warwick at lower prices.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR31677046">The front desk was just so so and didn't really seem to care. At 5 p.m. they had people waiting for their rooms and couldn't check in. The rooms seemed dirty and dingy and the pool area was dingy. It was in a great area - close to all attractions and the harbor which was nice but don't expect any help from the staff. There was a hefty parking fee in addition to a large room fee.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR31155943">We stayed here for 2 nights before an Alaska cruise and we loved it. Make sure you ask for a room on a higher floor with a view of the Space Needle. The entire staff is very friendly and informative. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel and its was very good. You'll be within walking distance of the monorail and waterfront area. Stop by Cascadia and have a martini with a scoop of Douglas fir sorbet. I'm not kidding, it's great!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR31081080">We didn't directly book this place. It was just part of a pre-cruise package. The outside looks a bit dated.

<comment category="positive" id="UR26590657">I spent 5 nights here, would recommend it for: 1. Location...walking distance to Space Needle neighborhood, and it's right downtown 2. Cleanliness 3. Smoking rooms available if you need that...confined to the 9th floor I believe 4. Restaurant...on site; excellent food at reasonable cost 5. Nice internet rate 6.

<comment category="positive" id="UR26563823">I stayed at the Warwick Seattle hotel for 4 nights. The best choice I made. Great hotel, very friendly staff. Located in between the Space Needle and downtown Seattle you can not have it better. I highly recommend You to look for the internet specials on their web page. You can save a lot of money. I did and I am very satisfied with my stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26508854">Booked this hotel on their website, based on the reviews on Tripadvisor, the location, and the price. Good price for a downtown hotel in Seattle. The hotel is close to downtown, Belltown, and the Pike Place Market. When I say close, I mean within a few blocks walk. When I booked the hotel, I asked for a room on a higher floor with a view. I got to the hotel about noon and just wanted to drop off my luggage before I headed out for the afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised that my room was ready. I was returning a rental car and the staff was very helpful in coming out to the car to get the luggage and taking it to the room while I returned the rental car. Wow! The courtesy and helpfulness of the staff was excellent! The room had a fantastic view of the Space Needle! The view and room exceeded my expectations. The room was very comfortable and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room had all the amenities of a modern, American hotel. Everyone at the hotel was extremely nice and helpful during my stay at the hotel, from check-in, to the front desk answering questions, to the bellhops. I couldn't have asked for a better stay. Ralph's, which is a grocery store, is across the street. It has has some normal items and a lot of specialty items. You can eat there if you want; there a few tables. It's a small store and a little upscale, so normal things like soda cost a little more than a Walgreens. You can't beat the convenience and that alone is worth the slightly higher cost. We like to walk and we could walk to a lot of sites from the hotel--space needle, park place market, downtown, restaurants. We went to Belltown one night to eat and one afternoon for a snack. I always felt safe walking to and from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR25705962">The hotel staff couldn't have been more accomodating. They sent up a hand written note of congratulations on our anniversary stay. Grocery Market across the street, very convenient. We bought wine there. We walked everywhere downtown, Westlake Center, Pike's Place, Bainbridge Island Ferries, Ivar's Salmon House on the Pier and La Pannea for breakfast every morning at Pike Place...great coffee and wonderful pastries. The staff at Margeux's in the downstairs restaurant was quiet pleasant as well. Great view of the space needle. We'll be back!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24698900">When we first read reviews about this hotel, we became skeptical. We decided that maybe people expected too much based on the hotel name/advertisements. I believe we were right! We stayed for 2 nights with our 2 teenagers and had a great stay. Our request for a high level room with a view of the Space Needle was fulfilled. The pool, hot tub and sauna were available and well maintained (although the hot tub could have been hotter). The location is within walking distance of Pikes Market, the Space Needle and downtown shopping. The room we stayed in was a bit smaller then other hotels we have stayed at and paid less money for, however it was clean and comfortable (no complaints about the sheets from us). The room had a "well used" look, but keep in mind the hotel was built in 1981, so it is 28 years old. We were dismayed that there is a charge of $11.00 per day if you wish to have internet access from your room, and parking was $27.00 per day for covered and secure parking verses $25.00 for uncovered unsecured parking outside the hotel. The balcony wasn't much of a balcony. More like a ledge with a rail, but it did allow us to step outside to see and hear the city from our room. All in all we had a great stay and enjoyed ourselves. If you are expecting The Ritz or Breakers, you will be disappointed and post a snooty not so good review about this hotel.. If you are expecting a clean, comfy hotel with a pleasant staff and good location to downtown Seattle, then we recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR23267761">one of the worst nights ever at first our room was across from elevator and we did not want to listen to the "ding" when the door opens. we asked for another room we were given a 3rd floor corner on the street side. view of market and closed down theater. was woken by drunk and disorderly people on the street. bed was so uncomfortable must of been the original mattress from opening day. If was the worst night I think I have spent in a hotel. Staff did not care to listen to our complaint and charged us full price anyway. We traveled with another couple and they were on the 5th floor two floors above us and had the same problems.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR22871642">Well where do I start? HORRIBLE!. Okay the location was good and the restaurant was superb. Ralphs market was across the street and great as well as Dahlias restaurant. As for the hotel itself. We arrived there an hour early and were punished. Desk Clerk had something to say about our New Yawk accent. We were then punished by being given a handicap access room that had no bathtub. The room was drafty and it faced the parking lot and construction site which was noisy. The bed and the bed linens looked and felt like they were from the original days of George Washington. Shabby and nasty. The tv was antiquated, the stations limited. No fridge, small towels and never enough of them. Parking was almost 30 dollars a night and internet was exorbitant as well. The pool was nothing to write home about and the fitness room was .,. limited as well. all in all i would say that if it were the last hotel in Seattle I would sooner camp out.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR22696924">Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub. The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime and people had taken to scratching profanities into it. Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides. The hot-tub was luke warm at best and just like the pool it was filthy. We informed the desk about both the pool and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should. These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money. A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day. The rooms themselves were adequate although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains. The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field. This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep but you do not worry too much about quality. If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR21161140">This is a bait &amp; switch type of place. We stayed there before our cruise to Alaska, and I called from Pennsylvania to verify non-smoking. The staff would not listen when I said I refused to stay in his horrible smelly and dirty room. The lobby was also dirty, and they cannot accommodate a group of people before a cruise. About 4 hours later, after they sent a man with a can of spray to remove the smoke???? really a can of spray???? YES!, and I refused to stay there, they found a room with 8 spotlights in the ceiling, no towel bars on the 2nd floor that was non-smoking. I wonder what this room is used for during other times, because no other hotel room has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???? Perhaps the police needs to know about this place that has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???!!! We had to move our things ourselves after fighting with them for hours. And the consierge gave out bad advice about what time to leave for the ship. They said they have a smoking floor for over 20 years, and there is no way they can remove the smell of smoke from a room. I said I called long distance from Pennsylvania a week before the stay, and they said no problem. Don't waste your time or money by staying at the Warwickand they do nothing to help you. if you want a great place try the Doubletree Suites at Seattle, WA SEATAC near the airport for a large room with great accommodations and a great staff and they have people in the lobby to print your airline boarding passes with complete gracious, efficient staff for everything!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR21032686">My husband and I stayed at the Warwick from October 2-6. We arrived very late (after midnight) and have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the customer service at that time. Our room was #1905 on the top floor. It was basically a bedroom off a suite, as it had two connecting doors. We did request to be moved but were told the hotel was sold out and there were no more available rooms, which I found hard to believe. We decided to stay with the room rather than move the next day. Our view of the Space Needle was great although the balcony they advertise is no more than a stand-only balcony. Still nice to get fresh air though if you want it. We had very little noise even though we were right across from the elevator. I think floor 19 is a suite-only floor so there weren't many guests. Also, being so high up we didn't hear any street noise. Our room was decently sized with a queen size bed, separate area sink with mini bar, large desk, two side tables and large entertainment armoire/dresser with an older TV. Internet service was expensive - we paid $25 for three days. Room service was also expensive, which is expected, but was very tasty. We ordered breakfast one morning and it was delivered quickly and was very good. I was a bit disappointed in the concierge - they couldn't recommend a dance club when asked and their method was to search the internet for it - something I'd already done myself but was just looking for a recommendation. The location was great - a few blocks from the Space Needle and EMP and close to Pike's Place Market and the waterfront. Lots of shopping places nearby also and a small Ralph's grocery across the street. I used the gym a few times - there is also an indoor pool. The gym is small but has newer cardio equipment and a nice selection of hand weights. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the hotel other than the location. The rooms were decent but nothing spectacular, the customer service not that great and their cost for the internet was high.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20623235">We chose the hotel due to the excellent location in Seattle. I booked by contacting the property directly and had a wonderful first impression of the service. I also called back to verify that I advised of a late check-in and was once gain spoke with a courteous property representative. The hotel recommended a terrific sedan service direct to the hotel (complete with mini tour of the city). Check-in was effortless and the room request was honored as booked. We requested an upper floor (needle facing) and frankly am glad we had the booking. At 0600hrs there were a couple of folks in a theatre entranceway across the street from the hotel whose voices were amplified in the entrance, we could hear them on the 15th floor. Gilcrest and Soames toilettries were a nice touch and other room features are frankly forgettable (for a property considered to be 'luxury".) The view was nice, breakfast was great, fast and friendly in the dining room and the complimentary business center was a G*dsend (since I forgot my Seattle maps). One may come across websurfers monopolizing the computers, so get there early. For those familiar with "Ralphs" grocery in California, sadly the one across from the property is not the same. We reserved our walkabout for the next day in daylight, as the area has some sketchy elements if one is not familiar with Seattle. We'd stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20383852">As a travel agent myself, I booked my group at this hotel for both the a pre-cruise stay and post-cruise stay. My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest, noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there, Sept. 12th, the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm, then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise), request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star, nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean, bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican. The bellman - Joe, at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast, it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there, it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials. If you have a group going to Seattle, we used Shuttle Express and set up a "private" city tour for 3 1/2 hours and they took us all the places we wanted to go. It was great and they picked us up right at the hotel. Got a really good rate and by having the private tour we didn't have outsiders with us so it made it a lot more fun.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20234608">I had a great stay here! The location is perfect and within walking distance of many things. There is a grocery store across the street that is open late for snacks. If you want a great view and less of the city noise, I reccommend paying a few extra dollars to get one of the deluxe rooms- that way you are guaranteed to have a view of the Space Needle or the City. My room was on the 17th floor and I was lucky enough to have a view that included the Space Needle, and a little bit of Elliot Bay and Lake Union. There was new bedding/mattresses, and carpet in our room- the bathroom was the only disappointing part- the shower head was small and didn't have very much pressure. The staff was very friendly and willing to help- a complete turnaround from when I stayed here about 3 yrs ago. When I first arrived, I was given a coupon for the restaurant in the hotel (didn't eat there- not much variety and pricy) and a very helpful map of the city. Overall, I had a great stay and was glad that I didn't read into some of the not so good reviews!<topic>none</topic>

Grocery store accross the street and Dahalia's one block waay. for lunch or dinner, fabulous desserts. Pool area could use an upgrade.

<comment category="positive" id="UR18967360">We arrived on Sunday and checked into our room. We did just as we saw here and asked for an odd numbered room on the sixth or higher floors. The view was fabulous. The skyline and a direct view of the Space Needle. Quite impressive. The room was boutique and smaller than most luxury hotels but it was clean and comfy. We spent five days there and everyone was nice and helpful. We used the free internet to help navigate around the town. A very nice hotel centrally located in the downtown area. Everything was easily accessible by bus or foot. It would have helped to have a few bus schedules to points of interest in the lobby but the people riding the buses as well as the drivers were quite friendly and informative. The tv worked fine and had a great selection of channels. There is in room coffee, quite convenient but this is Seattle, coffee is much better from the surrounding shops. Pricewise and value wise this was a great place to stay. We enjoyed it thoroughly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18772572">We booked this 4* hotel on the strength of the recommendations on trip advisor and boy were we disappointed! All our previous selections had been a great sucess, so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home. We were travelling with 2 small children (5&amp;7) so booked one room for us all. The lobby of the hotel is small and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel. We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage. The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle. The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling. We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us. He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay! He gave us directions &amp; even advised us on portion sizes. The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful &amp; unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude. We enquired about other breakfast restaurants, whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings. The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups &amp; glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out. We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents. Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant. The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to places, but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey. We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill. When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it. Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff. We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17807947">We, along with another couple, stayed at the Warwick for 4 nights from 18th May. We had a room with a city view which was very comfortable. The staff were helpful and check-in was easy. The location is very good, within walking distance to shopping and Pike Market. There is a very nice grocery store across the road which is open till 2am and sells everything, even Australian wine. We ate one night in the hotel restaurant. Enjoyable meal. Would definitely stay at the Warwick again<topic>none</topic>

The Business Center was very convenient. The Staff was very courteous and made us feel welcome. Will stay there the next time that we are in town.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17419548">I stayed at the Warwick in January, on the 19th floor. I had a great view of the city, especially at night! In response to earlier reviews saying the rooms were drafty and cold, I had absolutely no problem with that. If there is one thing I will say about the room, it's that the heating was excellent! Rooms are a little outdated and mine was pretty small, but they're comfortable and clean, so no complaints there. This hotel has an excellent location for many local sights, great restaurants and pubs within walking distance as well. The staff was great and helpful with whatever I needed. Did not use the pool or fitness center. I would have liked to have used the business center, but it was always full. My only complaint was that the food I got from room service had a hair in it. It took awhile for room service to take my order, but the delivery was fast. Nice stay at the Warwick, would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16860738">I don't typically write reviews on sites, but I saw the last one and wanted to update it... I am physically writing from a room on the 16th floor of the Warwick hotel, visiting here from Hollywood, CA. I've stayed at a couple of hotels during this visit, and I have to say - this is extremely nice. I wanted to comment on the noise comment - I have to say, I think if you're familiar with city noise, this place is actually very quiet. I'm (again) from Los Angeles, so maybe my perspective is a little different, but it's actually a very quiet part of town. There is some construction going on about a block down, but it's during the day and not loud at ALL. I can't hear any of the other rooms, and the heater makes.. Well, the noise a normal hotel heater would make. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle ( and the museums around it), as well as Pike Place Market (and the waterfront). There is a very helpful store right across from it that stays open until 2 AM.. There's also constant cabs waiting outside the front lobby for when you want to visit other parts of the city. Also, if you have the opportunity - and no height issues - I would suggest asking for one of the higher floors - the rooms are all the same up until the suites on the top floor, so it's not pricier to ask for one. The view from either side is amazing - you can choose to have a view of the Space Needle, or of the city (I suggest the city - GORGEOUS). The staff have all been incredibly nice and helpful, and the room is exceptionally clean. Would totally suggest it to anyone!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16641800">The hotel is well located within the downtown core but the traffic and street noise is very loud. We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel. City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long. Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16444391">I am amazed at how special they made my mom feel. When I booked this hotel, I told them it was for my mom's 60th birthday, and asked simply that someone wish her a happy birthday. Much to my surprise and delight, they did so much more. When we arrived, I was told that our room had been upgraded to a room with a view of the Space Needle - it brought tears to my eyes. Last time we came to Seattle, we stayed at The Fairmont - and while it was nice, it wasn't too special in any way...just nice. This time...well, I'd lost my job earlier this year, so The Fairmont was out of my price range, and the reviews on The Warwick looked like we would have a nice stay; but that was all I was expecting as well. What we experienced was phenomenal - the front desk clerk Lisa Smith not only secured us an upgrade, but when we returned late at night from a day of shopping and a nice dinner, there was a champagne bucket with Martinelli's sparkling cider and two glasses waiting in my room; she also said "Happy Birthday" on a note, and we found an accompanying cheese/fruit place set beside it as well. Blew me away. I would not hesitate to recommend this place. It is a little older, but it is in a terrific location (amazing restaurants surround it, and two blocks from shopping, plus the new Indiana Jones movie was playing across the street), everything is really clean, with hints of modern furnishings to update it - and of course, most of all, their personal touch made my mom's 60th a memory for us both to cherish. Location location location, tidy, and personal touches; what's not to love...especially when they make your loved ones feel important!?!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15897343">I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights. The lobby and dining areas are fine. The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work. I had a room on the "quiet side" of the 12th floor. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel. As previous posts mentioned, there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way. I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked. The room was so loud from buses and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time. I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips and this was by far the noisiest. The towels and sheets were threadbare. The heater roared loudly, and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft. The conference facilities were drafty and the food was average. The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant and he sent me down the wrong street. This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR15358622">We had researched several different hotels before deciding on the Warwick- we chose it because of the affordable price and location in the city. Upon arriving, we were very pleased. It is in a prime location, a short walk from the market, and very close to shops and restaurants. Our room was spacious, very clean and it had an amazing view of the Space Needle. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. When we were checking out, we noticed we had been charged a fee for using the internet (we had never used it). We notified the people at the front desk and they immediately fixed it, no questions asked. They also offered to get us a cab even though we didnâ€™t need it. An overall, very satisfactory experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15039553">This is a nice classy hotel which my company booked for me. It has a nice restaurant and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. If you have the money to spend, this would be a great place to stay. The only thing I did not like about this hotel is they make you use their wireless internet service which you have to pay for. If you have dial up capability, it will work for a while, once they learn that you are using free dial up, they will but a block so you can't dial up. Majority of the staff is nice, but when I stayed there, the person who checked me in was absolutely rude. Check out was very smooth and the Grey Hound Bus stops right outside the hotel to take you to the airport...for a fee of course.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15035544">This was our second time staying at the Warwick, the first time we stayed here was a few years ago. Reading the other reviews, I definitely have to agree with alot of them, the hotel is starting to show its age. The location is great, and with Ralph's Grocery Store right across the road, its so convenient! The service there is decent but wasn't memorable. This time we were on the 7th floor and it was so noisy. We were woken up a few times during the nights by so many loud sirens and outside noise. I know this is downtown Seattle, but I never experience it this bad when staying at the Warwick on a higher floor and when staying at Mayflower Park a few blocks down. The room was average, could use renovation. The water pressure in the shower was terrible! Perhaps it was just the floor? I love the restaurant they have there, its such a great place to have breakfast! Excellent service! I would stay here again despite of the noise and the rooms showing their age... but I think next time I'll try another place.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14556136">Stayed a night at the Warwick over March Easter weekend. Looked through the reviews here and prices of places on expedia previous to travelling from Vancouver and this place looked to be the best value, and it was. We got an even better rate with our Automobile Association membership (AAA or CAA). It was $132/night including all taxes - about a $20 saving over their already reasonable rate (IMO). Parking is an additional $27 but they didn't charge us for this. Basically we were looking for an upgrade to a motel and wanted an indoor pool and hot tub, and wanted to be in the heart of the city. This was it, with pros and cons. We could have stayed at a Quality Inn (1/1/2 stars) for $80/night, or The Sheraton (4 stars) for $210/night. Wasn't drawn to either for reasons of amenities and price respectively. Overall, the biggest pro is what you get more than you pay for IMO: Service well beyond a motel; nice indoor pool and hot tub (you'll find few of these in downtown Seattle), work-out room, newspaper at your door in the morning and invoice slipped under your door on the day you check out, friendly staff, easy early check-in upon our request, a very nice bar - we popped in for a martini - and restaurant which looked nicely run with French flair. Bathrooms are granite and quite clean, although a tad worn. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle. One outstanding feature is the proximity to everything, and this is what we wanted. We walked to everywhere over the 2 days we were downtown. EMP - which was outstanding - is within "Seattle Centre" as is the Science Centre and the Space Needle. The Science Centre is a must for those with kids; much bigger than Vancouver's Science World with more to do. We also walked to Pike Place Market, and to several restaurants and downtown stores close by. Also, about 3 blocks away from the Warwick is a great jazz bar called "Tula's" and the area of town (Belltown) has got great character while still being downtown and extremely convenient. Downtown stores were also an easy walk. We walked to Seattle centre, spent the day, then took the monorail (3 minutes ride) to downtown, then walked back to the hotel. A great day. Cons: Only two, but one worth noting for sure. Our room was on the 6th floor of about 25 floors(?) but much too noisy through the night. Not constant traffic, but intermittent busses made things tough. Our kids had no problem sleeping, but I awoke at 4:30 AM and checked our our window to see if it was open, which it wasn't. Next time, I will request a room much higher up which the check-out clerk said was the way to go. One other con was the beds were too small for me (with my wife). Maybe they were doubles(?); fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. Again, I'll request this next time. Tour tips: Forget the Space Needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. Not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket. EMP- Same price as the Needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. Hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. Fabulous for kids or those who are into this. We thought our kids might get bored. They didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. Can't say enough about it. Science Centre: Again, great value and if you're from Vancouver and have a Science World membership, you get in free. But even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more. Restaurants: Of course lots in the area, and we loved the Thai food places. Parking; Hotel parking is $27/day and is actually a pretty good deal for central downtown. That gets you parking for your stay and until 5 PM the day you check-out. Very convenient and we didn't bother hunting for a cheaper deal - what would we get elsewhere - $20/day - so why bother? Besides, they forgot to charge us for the parking upon check-in - we didn't notice until check-out and they just said "It's on us" when we checked out. Very nice. Overall, a very positive experience and we love Seattle. We're happy that we didn't pay the extra for the Sheraton, or go to the Quality Inn for not a lot less. We'd go back to the Warwick with a definite note to advise the staff upon reservation that we are "sensitive" to street noise, and to place us accordingly - upper floor - which I'm sure they will do.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR14083410">I am glad I got a discount. The room was clean, but nothing special. In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear. The size and amenities were no different from a good Best Western. Just as noisy too. Maybe that is why there is a discount. The service was average. However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car. You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service. If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby. The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR14055180">Stayed at the Warwick for a weeklong conference - the room was on a lower floor with a view of a parking lot (and my rate was at least $140-160) - the draftiest room I ever stayed in! A nightly wind across the floor... The neighborhood is perfect - close to everything. Room was clean and the appliances worked. I stuffed the bedspread against the window at night, to lessen the draft. Disappointed that my room rate could not include something nicer, or any view at all, but the city was booked for the conference. (FIX those windows!). Oh, and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation. The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room, and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single, came back from my conference, and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering. The manager didn't see fit to come up - just called me back later, asking me if anything was missing. Lucky me, I had forgotten to close the safe, but everything including valuables was still in place. I think the manager could have managed to make an appearance in an instance like this, and I have had experiences in other hotels which were less dramatic, where a manager made an appearance to explain the problem. The restaurant is not good - even breakfasts were hit-or-miss (how do you screw up breakfast?) On the other hand, there are wonderful eateries in the neighborhood - try another venue. The staff in the restaurant were the nicest on staff, though! Oh, and the prices for breakfast in Seattle are shocking - not sure why. On the east coast you can eat like a king for $15 at breakfast - here, I didn't escape for under $22 and didn't necessarily feel full. I was offered a discount on my next stay, after I wrote the chain. But... I cannot imagine a repeat visit to that hotel. If I return to Seattle, I'll be looking for accommodations elsewhere. There are some fabulous hotels (my friends were in them, and some paid no more than I). Seattle's nice people and fun atmosphere were great - if that and a place to sleep are what you're looking for, this could be the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR13685244">We stayed 2 nights with a toddler. The room was fine and quite nice for a 3 star hotel. The location is nice and you can walk anywhere in the shopping area of downtown Seattle, including the market. Across the street was a grocery/deli store that was open late and you could grab food or a coffee. We would stay again. Th only negative were the staff. When we checked in (which was late at night after traveling with a toddler), they gave us a room that was not cleaned. Then we switched rooms and then they gave that room to someone else. When we checked out and caught a taxi early in the morning, no one helped us or even opened a door. There were tons of staff in the lobby (no other clients) and we had a toddler, stroller and LOTS of luggage. The doors are not automatic, so imagine us trying to get out and organized! Not one person even said hello. The lobby is small and they could not have missed us. That was very disappointing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR13442351">I stayed at the Warwick while on a business trip to Seattle. It's located in the downtown area and is very close to shopping, restaurants, Seattle Center etc. I took the Gray Line Airporter shuttle to the hotel from the airport. The Airporter runs every 30 minutes between 5am and 11pm for only $10.25 or $17 round trip. It was quick and the drivers were very friendly, I'd definately recommend this service. When I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very welcoming. I received a room with a King bed on the 16th floor with a beautiful view. The room had a standard mini bar &amp; fridge, a small coffee machine and a comfy robe. I was relieved that they had room service and enjoyed a grilled sandwich and a glass of wine in my room after a long flight. This hotel is one of the few in Seattle to have a pool. The gym is nicely equipped and the business center is open 24 hours a day. Other amenities include turn down service and a daily newspaper. The restaurant served a delicous breakfast, and the bar was a nice quiet place for drink in the evening.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR13293583">We selected the hotel based on the criteria that I was traveling with 2 12-year-old-girls who "wanted an indoor pool and to be close to Seattle Center and Pike Market." This narrowed the field, so we chose Warwick. Based on other reviews, I wasn't sure how the hotel would hold up to our expectations; happily, it did. I gave it a "5" because, for the price, there is absolutely nothing more I could have asked for or expected. We arrived in the city by car (crystal clear directions and super easy to get to hotel from I-5 - being a country girl, I'm a little nervous driving my stick shift on Seattle's crowded streets and hills) at 12:30pm. Called the desk from the garage to see if we could check in - No, not yet, but the room would be available at 1:30pm, but we could stay parked in the garage. - Great - At check in a while later the clerk was quick, polite and offered us a map of downtown, some attractions literature and a coupon to Macy's. Another employee walking by, recognized our name (he's the guy I spoke with earlier) and welcomed us and told us he had us in a nice room. Sure enough! when we got to the 14th floor, we had a killer view of the space needle dead in front of us, Lake Washington was off to the right and the Sound off to the left - wow, nice view from our little Juliette balcony! We were in a double/double and if was furnished nicely and clean. And gobs of pillows! - nice touch! After exploring the malls, market and the city, we headed to the pool. While it is true that it is small, I liked that about it - not "dungeon - y" at all, like another reviewer mentioned. The hot tub was hot and the pool water warm enough. The next morning the girls wanted to get in another swim and I wanted to get in some cardio. Nicely enough, the exercise room is adjacent to the pool and seperated by an all-glass wall. So I got in my 30 minutes of bike riding, all while being able to keep an eyeball on the girls in the pool - nice! An employee caught the elevator with us on the way out of the pool area in the morning and asked the girls how the pool was, they commented that it was nice and even warmer today than yesterday. The man replied something like - Great, I turned up the heat a bit from yesterday - and off he went into the lobby. It is refreshing to see people care about their jobs. Also, maybe because the hotel is unpretenious and makes you feel welcome, the other guests I spoke with at the pool and weight room were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their stay, as well. At check out, they allowed us to keep the car in the garage until 5pm...another REALLY nice touch! So the Warwick far exceeded my expectations, especially since I booked in at the AAA rate (104) !! Parking was $27 - which is expected for downtown and I got FULL use of it from 12:30 one day to 5pm the next. While the hotel isn't super upscale, it certainly delivers value for the price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR13093026">I read the reviews about noise, and used the hotel website to book my room. Interesting, their site gives you these checkbox options: 1) Room farthest from the elevator 2) Room on higher floor; 3) Quiet Room. In the interest of getting the QUIETEST room possible, I checked all three hoping to get one of the three. Well, I got on the 6th floor (out of 18-19 floors), across the hall from the elevator, and listened to trucks and ambulance sirens all night!! Sheeeesh!!!!! Aside from that, the heating units sound like small plane engines, and you can hear them from the surrounding rooms. If you can get by all of the noise and are one who sleeps through anything, the facilities are clean, conveniently located, reasonably priced, and the staff quite helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11588592">I just got back from a great girls weekend with my mom. Every year we stay in downtown Seattle and go Christmas shopping. We had never stayed at the Warwick before. I found out about it on Seattlesupersaver.com. Parking is quite expensive, (it is everywhere in Seattle) but it was included in the supersaver deal. The hotel room was good-sized, we had a small balcony and a great view of the Space Needle. It was worth it to pay $50 extra and get a little larger room and view. (I think the total was $149). It was so close to the downtown shopping area that we walked. It was only a few blocks. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay at a nice hotel in downtown Seattle but not break the bank.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR11183987">Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown. I would classify this property as a three star location. We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition. The room was spacious although a little outdated. Perhaps some rooms have decent views but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings. There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel. Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars). I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11127524">We loved every one of our 4 nights at the Warwick, and laughed all the way to bank at the $104/night rate. While the Warwick looks like your typical Holiday Inn on the outside, it has been completely updated inside with warm, modern decor. We asked for and received a high-floor room with a nice view. Our request for an extra robe was filled within 5 minutes. The staff were attentive and helpful and the room was very clean, warm, and comfortable. We walked to ALL the sights downtown and never needed a car. The Hotel sent Shimsu with his towncar to pick us up at the airport for $35, just $3 more than a cab. Totally worth it. Our only bad experience was trying to catch the regular airport shuttle back to Seatac from the hotel. The Warwick sold us our shuttle tickets the night before our departure, then informed us the next morning that the shuttle wasn't coming because of street closures for the Seattle marathon, then initialy refused to refund our ticket, until we complained loudly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10830238">after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick. I was wondering what i was getting myself into. The hotel is older, but i found it clean. Front staff are really trying to improve their customer service. Errors upon checkin. They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds. They told me no rooms available. They offered to bring an extra cot. When i was settling into room, front staff said they located a two queen room and so i was moved. Package was to include free parking but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about. I'lll see what they do about it. Would i stay again? Hard to say. Room was quiet and clean. Nothing spectacular. I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin, but they seem to be trying and sometimes that's all you can ask for.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10584518">The Warwick could be nicer with a few little changes. First off, the staff was very friendly at check in and it is apparent that someone is working with them on customer service. They seem to be trying a little too hard -- in other words, they haven't perfected their customer service persona yet. When we got up to our room, I was pleased with a great view of the space needle but disappointed by the VERY LOUD street noise. (And we were on the 6th floor -- can't imagine how loud it was on the 2nd or 3rd floors) The room itself was generally comfortable but the bathroom was cramped and could have been cleaner. There were some mildew spots in the shower that just needed some bleach applied. It was a potentially really fancy marble shower that could have been really impressive it were cleaner and had a better fixture set up. Parking is a complete night mare in this area and we ended up paying $27 to park at the hotel overnight, which is a real rip-off but you really don't have much of a choice. Also, the parking garage doesn't have an elevator so you should plan on sending the most fit person in your group to park and lug the bags down/up the stairs. I don't feel this room is much of a bargain considering I paid almost $150 for one night on H*tw*re. I probably wouldn't do it again. No major complaints but I wasn't blown away either.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10374856">I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed, so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended. The bed sheets were old and felt like they were poorly washed. The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water. Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet. The drain was slow and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower. One side of the room is all window with a patio window...not much of a view. So with the window also came all the city noise. Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either "Off" or "Automatic" so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise. It was slightly cool outside and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window. The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines. The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area. The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport. Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10072611">We are relocating to the Seattle area, and thought that the Warwick would be a good place for us to stay while we were house hunting. Returning to the Warwick after a day out with the realtor was just what my husband and I needed. The staff were always welcoming upon our return, and very helpful in answering all of our questions. Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable, with an absolutely spectacular view of the Space Needle. The location is perfect for walking almost anywhere, and we enjoyed many delicious meals in the Brasserie Margaux Restaurant. We especially liked their crabcakes and the tapas selection at "Happy Hour". The Hotel was decorated for the Fall season, which added to to the warm, welcoming atmosphere. We did find a home in Seattle, but hope to come back to the Warwick for a weekend getaway once we are settled. We also now know where we will be putting up all of our out of town guests. Thanks to the Warwick Staff in making our first few days in Seattle such pleasant ones!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10071888">We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October. Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor. Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.). They charged us more than the quoted price, but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now. To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights! $487.51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL. We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem; we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will "be fixed immediately--I promise." This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10065014">I was in Seattle for my best friends wedding and she had reserved a block of rooms at this hotel. My husband and I checked in Friday night, along with another couple, intending to stay two nights. When we checked in, we were told that our room would be a different price than what we were quoted. I questioned the woman checking us in and she said we needed to have the confirmation number. I printed off the confirmation number and showed it to her. She then told me that the confirmation number was not enough, and that I needed to have the price I was quoted in writing. I did not have time to deal with that right away ( I had to get ready for the rehearsal and grooms dinner.) So, we ran up to our room to get ready. When I opened my hotel room door, the smell of smoke was overpowering. I immediately returned to the front desk because I had definately not booked a smoking room. The woman at the desk told me that my room was not a smoking room, but the floor underneath my room was smoking and it must have drifted up. !?! I asked her what she could do for me, and quickly because I needed to get ready and go. After she debated with a couple other employees I was told I could wait 40 minutes while they cleaned it or check into a room on the 6th floor (no view) which was a downgrade from my 15th floor with a view. I had no other choice than to take the downgrade. I asked to speak with a manager, no one was available. I asked to speak with the person that I had originally booked my room with. I was told I could call the front desk and asked to be connected to her, if she was in. We stayed the night, in the 6th floor room, and the fan in the bathroom was broken! The next day, I reported the broken fan, and again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager on duty was on lunch break,but I could leave my cell phone number and they would call me. I never recieved a call. We all checked out after the one night, telling the person at the desk that we were extremely dissatisfied. The staff seemed very uncaring. I asked for directions to the Marriot by the water, they could not give me directions. I asked them to look it up on mapquest for me, they couldn't do that either. I just looked at my bank statement and realized they have charged me for 2 nights! I will have to call and figure this out now. This hotel is a joke, and it is not even nicely decorated. It seems run down and old. The bride had the suite on the top floor, and even that room wasn't amazing. The furniture was marble, but chipped and looked out dated. I would never stay at a Warwick again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8739310">We had stayed at the Warwick mostly because of its central location (in the heart of downtown and close to Qwest field), and figured with its reasonable price and free shuttle - why not try it? Even before we had arrived at the hotel we received great customer service! Well, we were lost (google directions weren't very good) and it was dark, so we called the hotel and the lady who answered the phone stayed with us on the phone directing us to the hotel until we dropped our car off with the valet. The parking may be pricey, but the free shuttle service the hotel has, more than made up for the cost! Also, because we were in downtown we walked to Macy's, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and to the mall. The restaurant in the hotel was very good! But a tip - make reservations for Sunday brunch because it gets quite busy. The service was great, the rooms were very comfortable and clean. The water pressure was lacking but that was the only con during the whole trip. We had a paper delivered to our door every morning...what can I say except that we have already booked another trip to Seattle this November and we are of course staying at the Warwick again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8493469">This is the second time that we have stayed in The Warwick Hotel and we really enjoyed the Hotel again. We had asked for a quiet room on a high floor and this is what we were given with the added bonus of a great view of The Space Needle. The room was spacious and very clean, the bathroom was good and the bed was extremely comfortable. We also liked the fact that it was possible to open the door onto the mini balcony - real air! The staff were all very friendly and helpful and were able to answer all our questions about buses, ferries, sights etc. We would have liked the Hotel to have a stock of bus and ferry timetables but this is a minor point. The Hotel is extremely well situated for getting around Seattle. It is walking distance from Pike Place Market, The Space Needle and The Museums of Music and Science Fiction. There are bus routes conveniently nearby which will take you to most destinations including the Airport for a mere $1.25! It is also walking distance from some good restaurants. An added bonus is the fantastic Deli/Supermarket opposite the Hotel. They do great breakfasts as well as snacks, wine etc - check it out! We would definitely stay in The Warwick Hotel again if we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8449582">My husband and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights this summer. When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights. We ended up arriving at the Warwick at 10pm, we checked into our 4th floor room and were very surprised when we opened the patio curtains only to find that we were looking directly at a cement wall about 2 feet away from the porch. No view at all. We called the front desk, and they said sorry, but since we arrived late they were unable to accommodate us but maybe the next night they would be able to move us to a higher room with a view. Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle. Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds. Can't complain about the rooms. The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer. The staff, however, left more to be desired. We do not have kids of our own, but I noticed how rude the staff was to some small children that were in the lobby our second day there. It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members. One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in, then looked at the parents as if it was their fault. Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all. It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests. Our second night there, my husband and I were standing in the lobby, waiting for some friends, and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter. Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others. It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8136287">My husband and I took a day trip to Seattle earlier this month and we were having a HORRIBLE time trying to decide where to stay. We didn't want to have to pay a lot for the hotel and parking. We ended up decided on the Warwick because the AAA rate was $113. Parking was an addition $20, so all in all we ended up spending just under $150 for the night. I was nervous about staying here because I'd read some of the reviews on tripadvisor. Admittedly, when we first arrived, we were a bit put off by a rude desk clerk! However, the individual that checked us in was very nice (he gave us tips on where to eat, best way to get to the monorail, and just a general overview of downtown Seattle). I am probably writing this review because I left an item in our hotel room. I was really worried because I didn't know if I'd be able to get it back. (If you must know it's my childhood pillow). At any rate, the hotel contacted my husband to let him know that they had my pillow and wanted to know where to send it.!!! They sent my pillow and I can now rest easy! The beds were comfortable, and we had a pretty decent view of the city. So, I'd say the room was about a 4 out of 5. It's in a really good location, about 3 blocks to Pikes Peak, 4 blocks to the actual waterfront, and 6 blocks from the Space Needle. So you're definitely in walking distance to some major tourist attractions. The price was extremely good for a downtown hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8132749">The Warwick is in the heart of Seattle easy walking distance to Pikes Place, the Monorail terminal and Downtown Shops. We stayed twice recently at the start and finish of a tour of the Pacific North West. Staff are very helpful and knowledgable, rooms are large and comfy except that they only have one armchair in a large two bedded room. Rooms have fridge and coffee maker.Parking is on site, it is expensive, but I guess it reflects city centre parking prices. It is in the Free Zone for travel on Seattle's buses so it is very cheap (free) to travel around central Seattle, and there is a handy grocery store opposite<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8127540">We stayed here for 5 nights last month. The initial impression was poor - being told that we could not get help with the bags as â€œboth trolleys were in useâ€�. I was left to find a trolley myself at the parking garage and be my own bellman. Thereafter things got better - we had a very spacious room on the 17th floor with a great view of the Space Needle, service in the restaurant was OK although the air conditioning in the bar could do with being turned down - it was like sitting in a fridge. The only other glitch was with the bill - our rate included parking but it had been added on to the bill. Overall, however, a pleasurable experience and I would not hesitate to recommend the Warwick.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7483431">We stayed three nights, had a double room on the 7th floor. Upon check in the staff was not really welcoming. Bed linens are low quality, torn blankets, thin and worn flat sheet thrown over a thin, felt like pad on bottom mattress. We were there Thursday through Sunday, by the time we left Sunday, our trash container was stacked about 2 feet tall with trash that had not been removed from the room since the first day (newspapers, pizza boxes, plastic bags, paper cups). I kept pulling it further into the room each day, thinking they couldn't possibly miss it again. They did. Even though the hotel went through a renovation not too long ago, the rooms are pretty dated. Parking was expensive, $21 per day, plus wifi at $9 per day. with sales tax over 15% added on, it was not an inexpensive hotel. I remember seeing it rated as 4 star. I'd probably say more like 2.5 star. Parking for guests is on levels 4 and above. Yet, there is no elevator in the garage. Location of the hotel is very good, and although we did not try them, the bar/restaurant seemed pretty busy. Bottom line....we were not impressed with either the service or the hotel itself, and will definitely stay elsewhere next time we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7477677">I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel. It has some good points - for example, it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location. (It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk). However, those are the only positives. The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in. As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed. The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot. My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these "balconies", which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on , the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew. We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell. Anyway...I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep. Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort. The Warwick charges $23, (I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day. By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more. If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7275823">Stayed here for two nights as part of a tour package. The location is great and the hotel has a good restaurant. However, some of the staff seemed to be haughty. The pillows were hard and lumpy, bedding needs to be replaced.

<comment category="positive" id="UR7228087">I checked rates all over and found "GReat Rates" on the hotel web page which included breakfast for $132 per night for Friday and Saturday night. The location is great, we could walk to anywhere and it was also 2 blocks from the Monterail. The buses are free all over town if you don't want to walk. The staff was helpful. Ask for a room with space needle view. Small but very clean room and beds. cute little balcony. The continental breakfast had fresh fruit and crusants with a small pot of great coffee. Take a taxi from the airport when you arrive. They are also everywhere around the hotel with no waiting around. I made the mistake and booked the downtown airporter shuttle. This is a bus that makes a bunch of stops and is full. have fun.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6809001">Excellent value. A very warm place to stay. You can sit in the lobby and feel like you are in your own home reading the paper or you can join others in the lounge or restaurant in the hotel. It's quiet at night and the beds are very comfortable. We went to a fantastic Italian restaurant virtually next door where we were greeted and served like part of the family. We walked home from a movie at 12:45am and felt very safe in the area. This is will definitely be our first choice when staying in Downtown Seattle. If this hotel could be mimicked in every other major city in the world for value and comfort every other hotel chain would be out of business.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6724660">The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants. It has a nice lobby and the rooms were pretty clean. The front desk, however, was a horror show. We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning, we did not get our coffee, and consequently arose an hour late. And in Seattle of all places! On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation. Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour and that we should take a taxi. The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was "too far away". The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it. The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again. But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6711819">I stayed at the Warwick hotel 26-28 Jan. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center where I was attending the Travel Convention. The hotel is ok. Nothing spectalular. The front desk people are friendly though twice when my sister and I asked for directions, the ladies we asked had to go find the manager to ask her. The room we stayed in on the 17th floor was clean. It had a gorgous view of downtown Seattle. The only problem with the room was the lighting was very poor in the bathroom and the handle on the toliet fell off when I flushed so you had to be very careful. But the room was quiet and comfortable. The only other problem we encounter was in our search for a working ice machine. This hotel has 19 floors but only 4 ice machines..17th, 15th, 8th and 4th floor. The one on the 17th floor was out of order, the one on the 15th floor was out of order but Eureka! the one on the 8th floor was working so all wasn't lost. In summary, for the price I paid, it was an adequate hotel with a good location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6692232">We booked a room here over thanksgiving weekend with 2 small kids. The location was great! You could walk to everything. We walked to a great coffee house called Cherry Street every morning for coffee and breakfast then went to the museums and space needle then took a cab back to the hotel since it was very cold. One night my husband had a meeting to go to so me and the 2 kids walked around to the merry go round and macy and to pf changs for dinner where by the way we had a wonderful and I mean wonderful time eating greasy Chinese food. We even walked into macy's and got a santa picture of my two kids. No one was there and no line to wait it. What luck and timing. The kids rode on the merry go round and we walked back to the warwick and felt safe and sound. We did eat at the restaurant in the lobby one night and it wasn't good at all. Try one of the restaurants next door/down the street. They all looked so good. Next time we will. Warwick is great for the location, clean, good rates, nice pool, gym and valet parking (parking is a lot but a lot everywhere in seattle hotels).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6520567">Can't beat the Warwick for cost in Seattle. We were forced to stay here after our power was out for over a week at home. Being a native I know Seattle. The location was great, 3 blocks up from Pike Place, just a 4 or 5 blocks over from the Space Needle. We got the winter special, and got a corner room with a direct view of the needle, and Lake Union to the right, on the 15th floor for $100/night. The hotel was renovated, but there is still plenty left from the original 1984 building. The windows are old, and a bit drafty, the street noise, as in all big cities, is constant. We turned up the heat and did just fine. They offer all the things an expensive hotel does, witha great view, for a great price. We would definately stay there again, I'm not going to pay 200/night + to stay anywhere else in Seattle, when the Warwick is available. The restaurant next door, Assiago, was not worth the money, despite reading a good review we were disappointed. There are many better places to eat nearby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6352917">This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006 and the rooms are lovely. Although the rooms are modern, the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel. The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional. The location is convenient and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM. As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor, trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day. Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise. Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE. It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent. I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal. Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either. Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6128053">The Warwick Hotel has a great location in Seattle. Close to shopping, PIke Place and the Seattle Centre. However what really lets this hotel down is it cleanliness. The bed linen was torn, bottom of curtains were torn and the floor had a few stains. The hotel advertises itself as having a balcony ,which in reality is a disappointment. We stayed in a hotel in San Diego which did have a balcony - table, chairs etc. The Warwick balcony is about 10 inches.The view from rooms with a view of the Space Needle is terrific, but doesn't make up for the poor cleanliness. The check in staff were neither pleasant nor unpleasant and we decided not to sample the restaurant. Ralph's deli across the street is great for snacks and also has a cafe.There are plenty other better hotels in Seattle for the same or slightly more money than the Warwick - choose one of them e.g The Hotel Andra.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6014699">My first trip to Seattle. I selected the Warwick based on reviews here (and it was a package available from United), and I was not disappointed. I found the staff to be quite friendly and knowledgeable. My room on the sixth floor was clean and comfortable (in fact, the first night there, I fell asleep early, with my clothes on, and stayed that way all night)! I ate in the restaurant, and the waitress nudged me away from my first choice, and gave me a thumbs up on my second choice (I asked for her advice), a delicious rigatoni dish with artichokes and olives. Their bread is especially wonderful! The location is convenient for walking; the hotel provided a very helpful map. I used the Grayline shuttle from the airport and back, which was so easy.

<comment category="negative" id="UR6006603">My sister and I stayed in a two double bed room on the third floor (305) We requested a room on a higher floor, but none were available upon check-in. I've read reviews you can hear street noise on the lower floors. The room was very noisy and I couldn't get any sleep. If you're a light sleeper, go with a higher floor if you can get one. Room was nice (at time of walk in), but small. Bathroom was small as well and didn't have enough towels for two people. When we closed the curtains, I noticed several stains. They were dark reddish brown in color. I'm assuming they were blood stains. I was disgusted. The phone's earpiece was visibly dirty and there was a hair in the bathtub, before we used it. I left my comments about the room with management and haven't heard back. Location was great, close to shopping and the market. Parking was $21 a night, but a good deal since other lots are pricier and street parking is scarce. Check out is at noon and parking was good until 5pm. There is a grocery store across the street and a starbucks and seattle's best coffee 2 -3 blocks up on Lenora. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Food was good and service was great! Seattle Times paper was delivered every morning. Internet service is not included in the price of the room and cost $10 a day.

There is just an 18 inch ledge with ironwork to keep you from falling overboard. But you can open the patio door and partially step out for a view of Lake Union and Elliott Bay. The last morning we were there, the top of the Space Needle was hidden by clouds. It was neat to see it in sunny weather and cloudy. We had everything we needed at the Warwick.

<comment category="negative" id="UR5960956">Stayed at the Warwick on October 7 and 8, after booking through Expedia. It's a good hotel for the price, with nice rooms, restaurant, and pool/hot tub. The location is perfect, as you can park your car (Seattle is a CRAZY city to drive in) and walk everywhere. Only one problem with the stay. We were on the 8th floor, with a great view of the Space Needle. Late on Saturday night, the entire floor suddenly erupted in one huge party. The noise was incredible, as a large group of young people (not sure if they were high school or college age) were running up and down the hall, in and out of rooms with doors slamming, knocking on doors - including ours - and yelling and throwing things from the balcony to the street below. After several calls to the front desk, we asked to move to a different floor which, in spite of the hassle of having to pack our bags and relocate in the middle of the night, resolved the issue a(t least for us). We got a note of apology in our new room, along with a voucher for breakfast. I travel quite a bit, and have never run into this before. I'm not sure what a hotel can do in this situation - maybe some hotel owners or managers could explain what the policy is? One of the problems was apparently that there were several floors where the same thing was happening, and the hotel security was overwhelmed. The front desk clerk told me that as long as the guests were in their rooms, they were 'following hotel noise policy', which doesn't seem reasonable to me, if correct. In this case, it was more than simple rowdiness or high energy. I heard a voice from the next balcony saying 'Hey, don't -- on those people on the street!'! As well, when we finally did get a new room, the route to the elevator was blocked with a mass of people - on the floor, couples making out against the walls, people running up and down the hallways etc. Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts on this? Or, if you're a parent of someone who was on a school trip to Seattle over the Columbus Day weekend, and your child was staying at the Warwick, you might want to ask some pointed questions! Anyway, the hotel itself was fine, great location, reasonable price. Parking anywhere in Seattle is expensive, but at the Warwick there was secure parking available, and the location was easy to get to and leave from.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5905517">Stayed here for three nights in September 2006. The room was very comfortable, nice bed and clean bathroom. Found chocolates in my room upon arrival-nice touch. Other reviewers have mentioned that the rooms can be a bit noisy because of street noise. That's because you have a wall of windows - gives a great view but not totally soundproof. Ask for a room on an upper floor facing the Space Needle, there are 16 floors. I stayed on the 10th floor and had no problem with outdoor noise. Hotel is on 4th Avenue with lots of great restaurants nearby and a 10 minute walk to Pike Place market and shopping. Great bakery just a block away and a movie theater across the street. Shuttle bus from airport stops at the corner. The hotel is nice but not as nice as some other hotels in the downtown (but probably not as expensive either). Still, I would come back for another stay.<topic>none</topic>

Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand), but the front desk says the room is not available. Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available, although not the type I reserved. My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers. My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle. You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5809175">We had a post stay at the Warwick after an Alaskan Cruise. We stayed pre-cruise at a different establishment. Checkin is at 3pm. we arrived earlier and they were happy to store our luggage and told us we should have rooms ready by 11:30 or 12:00. They were. We however were given wheelchair accessable rooms so I can't comment on the regular accomodations. The rooms are average size and comfortable, although the bed frame sticks out a bit on the ends leading to stubbed toes if you get too close. The bed was comforatble, and the room contained all the ammenities you would expect. TV, alarm clock, coffee maker, mini-bar. There are small balconies with sliding doors. The decor is typical of a high rise hotel, but the leather headboard makes a statement. Ice machines are available on four floors only. The pool and gym are located in the basement. THe pool is small and 3 feet deep, but very nice. The hot tub was broken so I cannot comment on it. The gym is well stocked with equipment and towels. There is also a two person sauna available. The mens room has lockers and showers for changing. Although I went to turn on the shower and the fixture fell off. I was blasted back into the wall by a stream of hot water. The bathroom was set up with a handicap shower, no tub, and a hand spray fixture which had very little water pressure. The hotel is VERY convenient to shopping and walking around. There is a shuttle to the airport for 10.25 per person that leaves every :25 and :55 on the hour. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the airport and is very comfortable. I did notice the staff recommending the private car service to the airport for $35.00 but this is about the same if not more than taking a cab, especially after tipping the driver. I leave that to personal opinion. Would I stay here again.....Most likely not. Although the staff was friendly, and the restaurant good, the hotel lacked the comfort and personality factor that I look for when I travel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5778783">We stayed here on the last few days of our Pacific Northwest honeymoon. The rooms were large, but the bathrooms small. Very convenient to walk to most sights in Seattle, but watch out for those hills. The complimentary shuttle is for a 2 mile radius and is free drop off, no pick up, but they did take us to the Pyramid Brewery one night which is right next to Safeco Field. I'm not sure if that's more than 2 miles away, but for us it definitely wasn't walking distance. That was very convenient. The restaurant I'm sure is overpriced, however, they had happy hour specials that we took advantage of each of the two nights we stayed there. I think it was $3 draft beers (large glasses and lots of variety and loca lmicrobrews), and buy two tapas selections and get the 3rd for free. They also had $1 off all well drinks. The tapas were reasonably priced and pretty filling, i was very surprised. They were also pretty creative, very tasty. The bed was far from luxurious. Actually, i didn't sleep under the covers just because of how the bedding looked. The blanket under the bed spread was ripped and looked as thought it had been there since the hotel was built and the sheets were all wrinkled. Not the best end to a honeymoon and not very romantic. They also did not vacuum the room when housekeeping came (we had to wait outside at 4:30pm for housekeeping to finish, so good thing the bar had those happy hour specials). We're not slobs, but we did leave some crumbs on the dark flooring from some chips that were still there and stepped on when we got back to our room. The only thing I would really want is a microwave in the room, we only had a small refrigerator. Overall, not a bad place, I would stay there again if I got another deal on hotwire, but definitely not a romantic stay for a honeymoon.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5620596">We stayed here for three nights before a cruise. We were on the tenth floor with a beautiful view of the Space needle. Rooms were very comfortable. Plenty of room for our family of four. We loved the location, since the hotel is situated centrally to everything we wanted to see. Staff was pleasant and helpful with any questions we had. If you don't mind walking, you can get to just about anywhere from this hotel. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5522496">Great place to stay if you're looking to be in the heart of the downtown festivities. We had a room with a view of the space needle (very cool). We walked from the hotel to Pike's market and to the shopping district. Both are just blocks away. Ralph's Grocery &amp; Deli across the street is very convenient (and they sell Lambic). We went to a Marines game on Sunday. It wasn't too bad driving to the stadium and parking (15 bucks to park). Overall, the Warwick is a nice place (bathrooms are kinda small). We would stay there again, but also look at the abundant other hotels nearby just for some variety.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5480853">This hotel was an absolute gem. Small, but great service. The room was not huge but certainly adequate, clean and comfortable. Ask for a room on a high floor and get a great view of either downtown or the Space Needle. Best of all was the attentive staff. Concierges were friendly and helpful. The shuttle drivers also went out of their way (literally) for us. They will take you to the Victoria ferry and pick you up as well. Very convenient. Would recommend to anyone!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5048703">We stayed 4 nights in a room with a view of the space needle. This hotel is a few blocks from downtown shopping and on the edge of Belltown and a short walk to Pike Place Market. It's about 200 rooms--could be considered a large boutique hotel. Our room was not plush--but newish, clean with nice toiletries and bath robes. The service was fine and everyone who worked there was nice. In sum, the hotel is a bit of a compromise. Not the largest, not the most central, not the fanciest--but a convenient, well maintained place for the money.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4986577">We like the Warwick because of the great location - an easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Science Center, and downtown. Many good restaurants close by, and the incomparable Ralph's Deli right across the street (whose wireless signal works fine - you don't need to pay $9 for the hotel service). Ask for a room on the west side. The "weekend escape" rate at $179 is good value: it includes parking (otherwise $21) and breakfast (a $20 value).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4629350">Stayed for 3 days in March. Great location...clean...reasonable rates...very friendly staff. Easy walk to to many attractions...Ralph's Market across the street is excellent. Some negatives though. Noisy heater fan in room...seems like a lot of rooms have this problem. PPV movie channel had terrible picture. Lots of interference on screen. Staff alerted but couldn't fix it. Pool is small but OK. 3 out of 4 aerobic machines in fitness centre broken! A Space Needle view will have you facing Lenora St. This is a very busy bus route so be prepared for lots of street noise. In my experience, any downtown hotel has lots of street noise so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4587837">The hotel location was perfect, right in the center of town and just a few blocks to the convention center. I walked from here to Pike's Place market for breakfast, then on to the convention center each day of the convention and found it all very convenient. (Try the Crumpet Shop for breakfast, delicious crumpets, and cheap lattes before 8:30am every day!) The hotel room was clean and everyone who worked here was helpful and perfectly friendly. The bed was too comfortable :). The first night I had trouble sleeping though, because the heater would wake me up every couple of hours. By the second night, I learned to tune it out. There is a coffee maker in the room, by the way (I had read somewhere that there was only coffee in the lobby, and this is not true.) There is also a nice little fridge where I stored away spring water for my week. I had a view of the Space Needle without even asking - very nice. Unfortunately, they were working on the pool during my one-week stay, and that was kind of annoying because I had chosen the hotel for their pool. I did get to swim the first night, and it was a nice smallish pool. There was a lukewarm hot tub attached. All in all, though, nice amenities. Would stay again, would recommend for the rates, the location and the comfy rooms.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4462753">We made online reservations for two nights on the hotel's website and took advantage of the Warwick Escapes package. The package included best available room upon arrival, parking and breakfast for two for $150 including all fees and taxes - what a bargain! On arrival we were greeted by pleasant and attentive parking attendants, bellmen and front desk staff. Our room was exactly what we requested - clean, no smoking, high floor, king bed, quiet room, away from elevator, view of the Space Needle. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of many major attractions, shops and restaurants. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Warwick and will, with no hesitation, recommend this hotel to friends and family.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4458679">The hotel is in an amazing location with great restaurants, gourmet grocery, and cinerama within 1 block radius. It has Macy's, Nordstroms, other shopping within a few blocks after that. The mattress was very comfy. AMAZING SWEEPING VIEW of space needle, lake union, downtown, and Elliott Bay. Great pool and gym facility too! Room service is nothing to write home about. Don't get the pizza. Parking was $21. YIKES! Old building, but nicely remodeled.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4452109">Ok, here are a few comments about the last reviews and my stay. I just spent one night at the Warwick in Seattle. Location: very good. Staff: helpful and professional Room: nice mattress. High floor and away from elevator as requested. It is true that the heater is a bit noisy. Parking is expensive (almost $20/night) so is the restaurant Margaux although they do offer a 15% discount to the guests of the hotel. I whish the internet connection was free like in so many other hotels nowadays. Lobby is normally sized. Nice and well decorated. Why do you need something bigger? Didn't try the pool or the gym but my overall impression is good and I would recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4395153">The rooms at the Warwick were nice. They were clean, comfortable and quiet. However, there was nothing exceptional about them. The restaurant was also nice and the food was good. The staff, on the other hand, was not pleasant or helpful. In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude. I felt like I was in their way when checking in and asking questions. I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel, but donâ€™t expect too much.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4319275">We stayed at the Warwick for one night (was supposed to be two but the train ran 10 hours late!). The front desk staff were fantastic - we arrived in the morning after missing our first night due to the Amtrak train running late and we were fully expecting to be charged for the night we missed - but they waived that nights charges, something they didnt have to do. The rooms were nice and clean, we had a fantastic view of the Space Needle. We were using this hotel as a temporary stop over before going to the Inn at El Gaucho (see review) and when we were leaving the Warwick provided a shuttle to El Gaucho - fantastic service. Felt a little guilty leaving as we had no complaints at all with the Warwick and could have happily stayed there. From our experiences at the Warwick I would happily recommend the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4244333">My husband and I decided to plan a trip with my cousin and her husband. They had stayed at the Warwick many years ago and loves the space needle view. So, we booked both of our rooms at the Warwick for a three night stay. Upon arrival, my cousin told me, don't expect a huge lobby or check in counter. Boy was she right!! The lobby area is very small but cozy. Check in/out, question desk and concierge are all at one desk that is about 15 feet long. You feel so cramped if you are getting information and there are two people waiting behind you!! But, very good service. The manager who checked us in gave us coupon books, maps, anything that was going to help us around the city. That was very nice! The room was clean and looked nice. Until we went into the restroom. It was clean, very small, but clean but looked like a fist was coming through the ceiling. It was very weird! Also, in the shower, there was a cover that looked as if it was ready to fall off. We paid for the upgaded view of the space needle. We were told we'd be able to see it from our bed. Well, that was false. In order to see the needle, you had to stand in the corner and look at it or open the slider to see it. It was ok though. We read some reviews about the pool being kind of dingy and dark, but nice once you were in the water. So we tried it out. It is in the basement, but the elevator takes you right there. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench of chlorine. It smelled so bad. We decided to muddle through and went in the pool. The temp was nice, but we then opted for the spa. From the steam and the chlorine, both my husband and I had to leave because our eyes were burning and watering so bad. We told the front desk and a lady responded with "how do you expect us to keep it clean?" Overall, it was nice, but we probably won't stay there again. We found a hotel a few blocks closer to all of the shopping that was way nicer and cleaner and had cheaper rates. I think we will give it a try next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4138105">I travel for business and prefer relatively small hotels instead of the huge, name-brand dormatories. In Seattle, I found the Warwick. Two hundred rooms, not 2000. A very personable staff. Free shutle rides to your appointments around downtown. Tiny excertise room, pool, adequate restaurant, 24 hour room service. All at rates lower than the more famous people barns down the street. A very pleasant experience. PS. The hotel is in the upgrade process and the refurbished rooms come at at a $20 premium. Worth it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4126006">We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick. I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient. The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few problems worth mentioning. We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony. My husband smokes, but I do not, and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room. If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human. We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony, especially with the balcony door closed. Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor. This floor is where the public meeting rooms and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located. We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view. We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor. No Space Needle, no view. This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms. The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era "cans" (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed. It felt like starring in your very own "intimate film". The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed. The traffic noise was incredibly loud, and hotel construction noise started very early. Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day. We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated. The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up, and we had a nice Space Needle view. The bed was comfortable, the amenities average. We liked the in-room refrigerator. There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel. Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend, but I would take care if staying during the week. Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet). I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay. We did not use the pool or jacuzzi. As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort. However, we liked the bar quite a bit. Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere. We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience. There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle, but the food was OK and we had a nice time. The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations. The lobby fireplace added a cheerful, cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing. I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle. However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise, the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4051921">We stayed at the Warwick pre cruise. Chosen for location, price and free area shuttle. The shuttle was great to get us to the ship on Sunday morning. The Warwick is within easy walking distance to just about everything, but we had luggage so the shuttle was great. Desk staff and concierge are friendly and helpful. We did not eat at the restaurant, but spent time watching football in the bar area after checking out/ pre-cruise and the bartender was great! Room was a bit small, but clean and comfortable. Only complaint was street noise (people yelling, not traffic) at all hours all night. We were on a lower floor. I think if you're higher it would be ok. Despite that, we would definately stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3997302">When we arrived we were told we would have to come back at 3pm as our room wasnt ready. No big problem as the Warwick is so close to the shops and many restaurants that we could easily fill the time. They took care of our bags and had them delivered up to the room. Bit of confusion as we booked with expedia which included free brekfast every morning. The warwick had no record of this but the manager happily obliged and gave us breakfast vouchers. They were good for almost $19 and could be used for anything on their breakfast menu in the restaurant. So we were not restricted to just the usual continental breakfast. The restaurant is really nice and the staff very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and there is also a lovely bar area which is very nice to sit and relax in. We decided not to pay for the space needle view and probably wish now that we had. Lovely to have a balcony but ours was just above the car park. However, it was no big problem as there was very rarely anyone parked there and if you did not look down it wasnt a problem! The room itself was a good size and had a big queen bed. Strange layout with the bath and toilet in the bathroom and a sink and dresser area opposite, but nice. In room safe, mini fridge, hairdryer and tv all good although the air conditioning was very loud and quite annoying. We were lucky we didnt need it on. The pool was nice and clean, but i felt it a little scary to go down to by mysef as its in the basement and the pool area is dimly lit!There were very few people around. The Location as mentioned was brilliant and everywhere in Seattle is pretty much within walking distance - especially the shopping area, space needle and pike place market. I would definitly consider staying at the Warwick again and am a little shocked by some of the bad reviews. We enjoyed our stay and found it to be a really nice, comfortable, clean hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3975350">An older hotel, the Warwick nevertheless has been renovated and retained a sort of 1970's charm. the room was spacious and the view of the Space Needle terrific. However, they charge way too much for Internet Access - ESPECIALLY since you can get FREE Wi-Fi in the grocer-deli on the corner, and it is open to 1AM. Staff was courteous and helpful, and the restaurant is quite good. Everything is in walking distance. Great place to stay when in Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3615849">Just spent three nights at this most conveniently located property. As a flight attendant I stay in many big name brand properties so have a good idea of what's good or bad. The Warwick looks to have been renovated and yes some of the rooms are in places worn however they are comfortable and clean. The major thing we noticed here was the staff. Everyone from front desk clerk to housekeeping was just fantastic. They could have not been more helpful and really made Seattle a pleasure to visit. The hotel has a free shuttle which runs anywhere you want to go within about 2 miles. The drivers are well versed in geography and no journey seemed like too much trouble. It's not a Hilton or a brand hotel BUT it does have genuine personality and a caring team behind the product. It's not fake or pretentious. Great location and safe area at night. You have great shops and restaurants within walking distance - try Lolas just next door for flawless food.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3605654">I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room, a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice. The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation. At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card and stated there were no king beds and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds. We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice! It was nonsmoking. There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel. The "Warwick" mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells. The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine. The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning. The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning and pressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation; however, the tub facet dripped continuously. The tub drain needs attention, the shower curtain has holes in it. There was no coffee maker in the room. The bedding did not fit the bed and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew. Other staff were also unfriendly and short. The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant. I will NEVER stay at this hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3256816">My husband and I stayed at the Warwick after a company party. I had made our reservations well in advance in order to secure a special group rate for our company's partygoers. The reservations agent that I spoke with was pleasant, thorough, and helpful - he made sure that I understood what I would need to know about my reservation. Our first discrepancy occurred upon arrival. I had researched, at the Warwick's own website, the cost of overnight parking - it stated that it was $21.00 effective March 1, 2005. When we arrived, however, the parking attendant informed us that it was $18.00 and that we could add it to our bill. Upon check-in, this information changed again and we were instead informed that parking was indeed $21.00. Honestly, I believe that both amounts are ridiculously overpriced, especially considering that other hotel guests paid much more for their reservations and still had to pay this outrageous parking fee. Regardless, I disregarded the discrepancy and signed my bill. I wasn't going to cause a stink over $3.00. The bill was the second discrepancy of the afternoon - our company was given a group rate of $79.00 per night, however, my check-in information stated that it was $75.00. I shrugged this off as well, figuring that it made up for the miscommunication with regards to the cost of parking. The room itself was lovely. We were pleased with its setup and cleanliness and I really admired the furniture. While a fan in the bathroom would have been nice, it was easily overlooked once we opened the curtains and looked out onto the city - what a great view! Upon check-out the next morning, we again met with inconsistencies. Our bill was slid under the door of our room prior to our departure, so I reviewed it for accuracy. Suddenly the room rate was $79.00 again! While this was the rate that I had expected to pay, I was a little annoyed with the constant miscommunication. Not only that, but there were others from my company staying at the Warwick also - they had also mentioned checking in at a rate of $75.00. When my husband and I arrived at the front desk to check out (for some reason, video checkout would not work for our room), I mentioned these discrepancies to the front desk clerk. I made it clear, or so I thought, that I wasn't worried about the small amount of money that these miscommunications involved ($7.00, all told), but that I wanted someone to know what had happened. I wasn't even able to get out that I knew others that had been advised $75.00 at check-in that may be, well, more vocal than I was being. The desk clerk seemed clearly put out by this information and gave me short, quick answers to my questions. He informed me that the garage attendents were still having trouble remembering that their rate had changed and that the company party rate was $79.00. I explained to him again that I was okay with paying $79.00, but wanted him to realize that the paperwork provided at check-in stated $75.00. Honestly, he huffed and puffed and then took $4.00 off my bill. Really? I didn't care about the money. I just wanted him, or anyone, to know that people were being misinformed. My husband, who is quick to tell me when I'm getting overbearing and pushy (aren't all husbands good for that?), agreed that I had not done anything of the sort when speaking with the desk clerk. Overall, I can't give this hotel more than 3 stars. The hotel itself is beautiful and centrally located, but the service and attention we received was far from expectation.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3229772">We stayed at the Warwick for three nights about two years ago and loved it. We had traveled by Amtrak from Sacramento and then took the Clipper to Victoria for a couple of days. It was a magical vacation...all public transportation and walking to our destinations. Our room had one whole wall of windows that faced the Space Needle. (There was a sliding door that opened onto the balcony...weird) The room was small, but so cozy. The staff was wonderful. They have 24 hour shuttle service and we enjoyed talking with the drivers. We had dinner one night and it was great, the waitress had a strong French accent (something we don't hear often in CA) Beautiful food presentation, We easily walked to the Market. The Mall was great, with Monorail stop so convenient. Street entertainers were wonderful,and we were delighted to find real stores open on Sunday. We bought bento (box) lunches at the sandwich shop near the hotel and took them on the train, It was the best vacation ever..so glad that my daughter told us to stay at the Warwick. later I remembered that I had stayed at a Warwick hotel in Denver and enjoyed that too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3100658">Stayed the weekend of January 28th at the Warwick Hotel.Booked the day before and was told all I could get was a smoking King size on the city side.I told them that my preference would be a king size non-smoking on the Space Needle side away from the elevators as I had read here.When we arrived we discovered that our room was as requested.We were greeted by the concierge who was very helpful.The room was average size and the bed was comfortable.The wife loved the tub and the marble tiles in the bathroom.The room was very clean.We had a package that they advertised on their website which was $150 per night tax included , parking, and breakfast in the restaurant (which was very good).All hotels in Seattle charge anywhere from 15-25 dollars a night for parking.The location is great we walked to the Pike Place Market ,the Harbour front,the convention centre area at night for dinner.There were lots of people walking about and we had no safety concerns.Ralph's grocery market /Deli is next door and open till 2AM for food or snacks.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR2900499">We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick. It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping. The front desk was extremely gracious at check in, offering shopping discount coupons and restaurant reservations. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby. The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive. Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view. While there are hotels closer in downtown, we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR2873602">My wife and I stayed here on the final leg of our honeymoon in September after a 1700 mile drive from Vegas. We found the hotel no problem, the location is great and although the hotel looks somewhat shabby from the outside it's really quite elegant inside. What made our stay here particularly nice was the fact that we were given a room with a view of the space needle. The floor-to-ceiling window opened fully and we were able to enjoy the view with the sea air too! At night the view was spectacular. Staff were friendly and helpful, the cocktail bar is great and we enjoyed our stay here. Two quibbles: 1. The price - this is not a cheap hotel and with state tax and room occupancy tax it was one of the more pricey hotels we stayed at. If you're not on a budget it's worth it. 2. The lobby area is small and at the weekend was extremely busy with lots of people standing around seemingly at a loss.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2818540">Well for those who read trip advisor reviews, I hope you will pay close attention to this one. We stayed recently at the Warwick Seattle, for a few nights before continuing our Pacific Northwest journey to British Columbia. We booked through Clipper Vacations, the price was right, and we were told we would really like this hotel. From the moment we walked in there was a definite charm to it; cozy older lobby with a fireplace, 4 clocks from different major cities (I like this feature) and a concierge desk. At the front desk we were greated by a very cold and young front desk agent . No formal greeting no nothing, but a straight and matronly face (we were surprised as she must have been under 20). We asked her not to put us near the elevator in a room number ending in a 6. (We read this on trip advisor). She put us in roon number ending in 8. We went up to the room and this room was right next to the elevator. I immediately marched back down, and asked her to switch the room. (she did without any apology) She moved us 4 doors down. We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room, and we tried to adjust the heat, it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes, and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor, so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room , they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white, reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim, I guess to save money. The hotel is not in the greatest area and beware of seedy people around there. Brasserie Margaux was terrific and the grocery street across the street (ralph's) is great. I do not think I would stay at the Warwick again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR2771689">We stayed here 27th Sep-30th Sep and had a fantastic stay. The hotel is within walking distance to the Space Needle or the waterfront and is ideally located. We had a room on the 12th floor with a fantastic view of the Space Needle. It was very comfortable and well maintained. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and couldnt do enough for you. A wonderful start to our holiday in the States !!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122476164">This place is not even suitable for the homeless take my advice and stay far far away! We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!! GROSS...... seriously need a hazmat suit to enter.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119896310">This hotel is so bad it's a joke. I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables. The elevator crawls up squeeking the whole way with no certificate of inspection or weight limit posted. The room looks like somethig out of the 70s. Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading. Any positive reviews seem like ownership tring to do damage control on the reviews.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118110693">My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 16th July to 18th July. We selected this hotel purely for the excellent location and for the cost. But frankly we were in for a shock when we arrived at the hotel directly after disembarking from a cruise. There was only one person at the front desk and he bluntly told us that check-in was only after 3pm. Since it was a long wait (we reached the hotel at 11am) we requested that we be allowed to leave our luggage. Luckily he agreed., So we left and returned only later in the evening. There was only one lift and that was so ancient just like everythinhg at the hotel. The room was smelling awful and looked very dull and unwelcoming. There was free wifi only in the lobby. The bathroom was only just adequate as the toilet seat was wobbly and almost broken. There was no kettle or microwave anywhere in the hotel. We just managed to survive for two nights only because it was conveniently located to the Pyke Marketplace ,space needle and the sea front. Luckily there were good restaurants and Starbucks close by . I will think twice before staying again at this hotel<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116501344">This hotel had character! I really liked our room too. It was tiny but fun. Very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. If you need space to spread out this isn't the place for you but if you plan on enjoying the room just as a place to drop your things and go enjoy the city than this is the perfect place. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hallways made me feel like I was in a dream. I loved the decor!! Very artistic, not like any other place I have ever stayed. I was a little concerned because I had seen that this hotel was listed on the bed bug report. I called ahead of time to inquire about this issue. I spoke to the general manager who told me that bed bugs have now come to Seattle and they are a problem in the industry and any hotel at any time could have them. He also assured me that they bring in dogs to check the rooms on a regular basis and if any are found they are properly exterminated. I don't think you can ask for anything else. We had no bed bugs in our room! Yea! Anyhow the place is great! I would go back for sure. Give them a try.<topic>none</topic>

If you never iron your clothes, youd love this hotel as there are no irons in the rooms. If you feel that rusted bathroom and showers that dont work gives you an excellent reason to skip a shower, you'd love this hotel. If you think that a hotel that has no airconditioning in the rooms is a great opportunity to get fresh air, you'd love this hotel. If you think that having only 3 channels on tv to choose from is great, you'd love this hotel. If you think that "identify that carpet stain" is a great game to play with family and friends, you'd love this hotel.

<comment category="negative" id="UR115478061">The hotel is in a very convenient location, just a few steps from the University Street stop on the transit tunnel for free city centre busses or light rail. The price was very reasonable. The hotel was clean with regards to day to day cleaning - the lobby, corridors, toilet, shower were all clean, and the room was dust free with fresh smelling sheets on the bed, which whilst it was not the most comfy bed I have ever slept in it was OK. Deeper down bits of the hotel have seen better days. There was a rusty pipe and loose wallpaper in the corner of both my friends bathroom and my bathroom, both of our bathrooms had filthy suspended ceilings, there was also a bit of loose wallpaper in my bedroom and the TVs only worked on a few channels, in my room only one non religious channel in fact, and that was the "Opra Winfrey Network" - could not get any morning weather or news. Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router. No breakfast in the hotel, they reccomend you go to the restaurant underneath for breakfast but it sounded expensive to us so we went to a nearby Subway instead. This hotel was OK for us for the price as we spent very little time in the hotel except when asleep. I would not have wanted to spend an extended amount of time in the room though.<topic>none</topic>

But in the end, it probably would have been cheaper for us to stay at one of the nicer hotels a block over. There's no parking at this hotel, which meant we had to spend 30 bucks at a parking garage. Also, there's no internet in the rooms and our T.V. didn't work. Definitely a BIG disappointment.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR104384177">I am just a college student visiting Seattle, and without looking into greater detail about the hotel I was making reservations with, I got stuck with Hotel Seattle. I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in. No human being deserves to stay in such a mold-infested dump. OH YEAH- pay $10 for wifi for one day.<topic>none</topic>

The street noise is so loud I could not sleep all night. When I opened the curtains in the morning, the curtain rod came loose.

<comment category="negative" id="UR77871111">I read the reviewsâ€¦they weren't goodâ€¦but I thought, well, its just a couple of nights and we will be out and about most of the day...what I didn't remember is this is the only place where we can go home and rest...and its not a place I would recommend to go and relax, it small, dingy, old and not conducive to relaxing. There are only two hard backed chairs in the room to sit on; otherwise there is only the bed. This hotel in general needs TLC. We observed unfinished repair projects which showed wires sticking out of the light indicator above elevator, unfinished "window transom" above lobby entrance, and lots of little things that wouldn't take much time to finish to give hotel a nicer appearance. Some things were just annoying like the only useful plug-in for an equally useless hairdryer (which you have to check out at the desk, I think they only have one) is on the FAR opposite wall from the mirror in the bathroom. The noise from the hallway sounds as if the people in the hall are in your room with you. It is enough to say the staff could give a rip!!! This attitude just trickles down from the manager so forget about appealing to someone higher up. All in all, not only would I not recommend this hotel for any kind of stay, I would picket it if I lived in Seattle to save people from checking in!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR43920748">Downtown was pretty full for Penny Arcade Expo, so we spent three nights here. Every facet of our experience was so comically bad I was waiting for the cameras. The bathroon vanity was falling apart. The bathroom crown moulding WAS mold. There was no water pressure in the morning! I mean, how is that possible? I kept my socks on whenever I was on the carpet. The "restaurant" in the basement took almost an hour to serve scrambled eggs and pancakes to us in an empty room. Why go on? If you can't find a room downtown for your trip, convention, what have you, you're better off staying at the airport or uptown and catching an express bus (or soon the Link light rail).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR36594896">The location was great but that's about it. The whole hotel basically looks like every piece of furniture and accessory were taken from a trash bin and placed at the Hotel. We even asked the Front desk person about why a Hotel that has the potential to be amazing (The old building alone is reason to want to preserve this place) and he seemed to care less - though in his defense I'm certain he gets that question a lot. My partner and one of our friends are both 6'5" and the beds were so small that parts of their legs were hanging off the edge of the bed. Bathroom was incredibly small and slightly dirty.

It smelled like a thrift store, the pillows and blankets were minute, the bathroom belonged to a truck stop. The tile in the floor was cracked, the vent sounded like a wind tunnel, there was mold in every crease and there was no liner to rank-smelling shower curtain. The staff was unfriendly. The cleaning staff's cart was parked infront of our room's door when we first arrived. The maid watched impassively as we put down our luggage and stuggled to move her cart without offering any assistance as we moved it aside to get into our room.

Yes, the rooms are outdated, the towels and floormat were thin, limited cable TV and an overall lack of amenities that one is use to in a US hotel. But as one reviewer said "it is like a budget overseas hotel" and I have stayed in several that were in similar condition and I just enjoyed the experience. The check in and desk service was great. We asked for extra pillows from the maid and got them. We also spent $5 for flowers at Pike Street and they added character to the room. Location is everything. Our friends stayed at the Fairmont across the street and we stayed for 3 nights what one night cost them. My money went to dinners, trip to Victoria and baseball games.<topic>none</topic>

The hotel decor was depressing the sheets were threadbare and the bathroom the pits. They messed up our booking due to the fact that someone there booked us in the previous weekend so when we arrived on the Friday evening at 10.00pm US time (very tired) after a 10 hour flight they said there was no reservation for us. We had no option but to use our credit card to cover a one nights stay until it was sorted. We then had to wake up at 3.00am to phone the travel agent (due to the time difference) to try and sort it. This did not get sorted properly until the Sunday morning when we were due to leave for the cruise. This spoilt our stay in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

Our room was on the 8th floor and had no air conditioning; however, the windows were open to allow for the cool night air. Note that the window have no screens! And, because downtown is very noisy at night, we heard the nighlife from the local clubs and delivery trucks well into the wee hours. Unfortunately, it was not a wonderful location for a restful night's sleep.

<comment category="negative" id="UR19090759">Hotel Seattle is a seedy, overpriced dump. My wife and I spent three nights there in August 2008. The only real amenity was a color television. The bathroom exhaust vent was so loud we could barely hear the television when the bathroom door was open. The carpet was worn bare. The room had no air-conditioner. Although the first two nights there were pleasant with the windows open for a breeze in the room, the last night was extremely hot and uncomfortable due to a heat wave in Seattle. The hotel had no small fans available for use in our room. In addition, the hotel provided no ice. In fact, the front desk clerk told us we could have all the ice we wanted if we went down the street and bought it at a local convenience store. No hairdryer was provided either. Overall, our experience at this hotel was much less than desirable, especially since the room rate was higher than we usually pay for the usual amenities, i.e., air-conditioning, hair dryer, ice machine, mirror near beds, etc.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18242318">While tempting because of a nice, central location and price, unless you don't mind a hotel that has had no updating in over 30 years, including the disgusting orange 70's (used to be shag) carpet in the rooms - stay away! They did a fair job of keeping it clean, they only have so much to work with when the ownership obviously could care less about investing one penny in the property. The room smelled of things not to mention. If you keep the lights off, don't look in the corners, and wear your shoes while in your room at all times, you might be OK. No network available, so impossible for a business traveler. TV doesn't really work.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17554144">We stayed in Hotel Seattle for 2 nights and it was fine. It reminded me of the funky less expensive hotel rooms I found in Europe. There was some street parking available (the desk clerk pointed that out to us) during the week (don't know about how crowded it can be on the weekends). And there is a garage right up the street if there isn't any street parking. We were in Seattle for a wedding and wanted an inexpensive hotel downtown that was close to Pike Market, restaurants and other attractions and this fit the bill. The front desk staff was very very friendly helping us find restaurants and directions back to the airport. If you just want a place to sleep (because you'll mostly be out touristing, if you aren't looking for luxury, don't care about matching furniture, or city noises, this hotel is perfect. The beds were clean and comfy and I really liked the pillows. The room was cleaned both days and fresh towels delivered. I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story. But after staying there I realized that expectations really vary amongst guests. We felt safe, slept well, had nice staff encounters. If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the "mocking" W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here. Its funky, old, centrally located and has a nice staff. ps. The photographer who shot the lovely photo of the room did and amazing job, and possibly knows a lot about photoshop. Our room paled by comparison. But that's OK<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17238037">My family and I were traveling to Seattle for the graduation of our niece. This was a special time for us. A member of the family looked on the web for a hotel close to the graduation facility. All looked well on the internet for moderate priced accomodations for three nights. We called them directly and booked the stay. The staff was very nice and none of this review is meant to reflect on the them in any way. We understood that this was a moderate priced placed to stay but did not expect the what we found. The rooms are dark and dank and look like something that comes out of film noir. The bathroom had paper rolling off of the walls; it took two to three flushes for the toilet to flush. it was the most depressing place I have ever stayed in. We knew immediately upon arrival in the room that we could not stay there for 3 nights, so we took steps to find other acommodations and were fortunate to find them. We had to stay one night and I spent that entire time awake. We were at the nearest coffee shop at 5:30 a.m. and left in a taxi by 8:30 a.m. I write this review out of concern for others who plan to stay there. It was not a pleasant experience.

<comment category="negative" id="UR8190161">You will have better accommodations. With a name like Hotel Seattle I expected that they would take more pride in their establishment. My room was falling apart. From the baseboard coming off, to the unfinished shower, and not to mention, the unfinished pipes leading into a cut out hole in the floor. In the height of summer there was no A.C. and the only way to get some cool air was to open the window onto the busy street. I will never recommend Hotel Seattle and made sure none of the guest at the wedding I attended will go there either.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5824319">Thankfully we only stayed one night at the Hotel Seattle. Our room was an absolute disgrace.....very tatty witha layer of dust on most furniture. The bathroom had to be seen to be believed. The bath was old with ingrained dirt, the sink wobbled and leaked at the base. The floor tiles had a few decades ago seen better days. The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in. Whilst the location is handy for many of the tourist sights, it is not the best area to wander around at night and we felt quite uneasy doing so. I wish I had consulted Trip Advisor before staying there. Stay away!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5808628">The staff was nice. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments. I highly recommend not staying here. Avoid at all costs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5717919">What a relief! I blindly booked this by calling the hotel - they only had a suite - and got a great rate. Our room was clean (a few carpet stains in corners, no big deal), huge, smoke-free, had a kitchenette (microwave) and was in the middle of downtown. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant attached was excellent for breakfast, comfortable enough beds, and the location was quiet at night. Our room was right next to the elevator, and even that was inaudible! Cons - parking can be a nightmare - its street or city parking garage only, which can be costly ($20/day); not much of a view; some of the floors look like they might not have been updated - ask for one that has (and a suite!); only one elevator for about 11 floors); not too generous on the extra amenities (towels, shampoo, pillows) - if you ask, you get what you need though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4446350">This hotel is realli aweful, is the worse one i had choose from. i stay here just because at that time all hotels are full. therefore i stayed one night at there. Its horrible. u cannot image the carpet is green colour and kinda bug bites. and the ceiling is broken, also, the TV is kinda 1950's one, they should UPGRADE a new one okay? i haven't seen this kinda of OLD TV, and only can watch one or two channels and the colour from that TV is worse. The telephone is realli old. The elevator is worse than ever. and the light whether outside and inside all deem, not dark...realli terrify me to stay at there, its kinda hunting house. the service is not quite good also. do you need to choose cheap hotel, nice and clean one, u should choose 6 Ave Inn, that quite good i stay there for two nights be4 this hotel seattle. realli a nightmare for me. DONT CHOOSE THIS ONE, THE PICTURE IS FAKE...HORRIBLE.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4046031">First off, I will say that this hotel is in a great location, 3 blocks to the pike place market, shopping etc. Second, of course this hotel is located on a hill...all of downtown seattle toward the water is. If you are elderly, you may have issues with this but for most people it will not be an issue. This hotel pretty much only has its location going for it. It is an old hotel, which is pretty rundown. It did have clean sheets, which is basically what we were looking for. Did I walk around barefoot on the carpet or bathroom floor, the answer is no. A little dirty/dingy but ok for a place to sleep. For the price in downtown, its hard to beat. Also, be advised they have no parking (typical for seattle), there are 2 huge parking garages though within a block or two of the hotel so you shouldn't have issues with that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3606876">The location is unmatchable in this price range. A simple sleeping room is $80 but expect to pay 2x's that anywhere else. It was surprisingly cleaner than most hotels I've seen in the past week but I've been driving up from LA and staying at Travelodge and Days Inn and Motel 6. The quality of the furnishings was high. Sure, it's a little run down in spots but it's just an old building with some of the usual character flaws but none affected the comfort. We were lucky enough also to get a corner room so that made it especially nice to look over at the W and know they are paying $250+/night. It had a full bath, everything worked -- we don't care to watch tv anyway on vacation so have no idea how that worked but if you want to believe all the other comments, feel free. It will mean more room for us when we come back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3499277">Avoid this hotel at all costs. Even at half the price, it would still be throwing money away. While the location is very desirable, it is in disrepair, ugly, unclean, and generally unpleasant. The toilet in my room malfunctioned daily. The television would only pick up two stations. Although I had a great time with a friend in Seattle, I was happy to leave this hotel. It should not have a star rating at all.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2226877">I don't know how this hotel can get away with a description like: "All of the guest rooms have been remodeled in a relaxing decor" (from expedia), when the only thing that seemed to have been updated since the 1970s is the television. There is no room for toiletries in the bathroom, and the tiny pillows were very lumpy. If you don't mind staying at a Super 8 or Motel 6, you should stay here. Otherwise, I suggest you spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR1275352">Pros: Good safe downtown location. Walking distance to market, downtown stores, etc. Room and bathroom were clean. Request the non-smoking floor. Pleasant desk staff. Two coffee places around the corner. Cons: Looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the 1950's. An OK place if you want a simple place to sleep and shower. For the same room rate, the Executive Pacific Plaza (about 1/2 block away) is much nicer.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126846474">I checked with TripAdvisor before booking at the Inn at the Market. Like everyone else, I loved it. The valet/bell boys were very nice. You drive up to a little spot in front of a little sign and the bell boys quickly did everything perfectly including holding baggage after I checked out. Parking otherwise is quite a pain. I enjoyed the deck on top. I decided not to pay extra for a view room. I figured I'd look at the street and that would be fine. Be sure you don't get room #404. It is a lovely room but you look out on the building that is 5 feet away! It is probably the worst view room at the inn. But I still loved it there and will come again and get a view room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR126652378">Were given a room which faced busy downtown 1st Ave. Cute Boutique hotel in most excellent location at Pike St. Market with friendly staff, awesome view deck, and comfortable bedding...unfortunately, the windows facing busy night time street have not been upgraded and provided absolutely no acoustic respite from loud ongoing traffic, drinking crowd, or street people yelling all through the night! This along with intermittent window air conditioning unit going on and off continuously resulted in getting absolutely NO SLEEP!!! at all all night long!!! At check out we were not the only ones complaining about this! For this kind of money, this should not be happening at this establishment! Otherwise, it would have been great!

<comment category="positive" id="UR126491228">We got the Special Art Museum Package at Inn at the Market for our 3 day trip to Seattle. The customer service was first class and the location of this classy hotel was perfect! We took the light rail from the airport and got off at the Westlake station &amp; walked 4 blocks to the hotel. We were early and they held our bags until the room was ready. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view and it was beautiful. There's a deck viewing area to soak in the views. The location next to Pikes Market is perfect because we could shop, eat, and rest anytime! The customer service was excellent! Beds were comfortable and we could see the ocean when we got up! I would definitely book this hotel again. The location, service and quality make Inn at the Market an excellent value!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126307453">I normally stay in a bit less costly of hotels when traveling, but this hotel's location was perfect for my step mother who was traveling with us. It is within steps of the Market. We received a double room on the fourth floor, where both windows either looked out over the sound or the market. I couldn't have gotten a better view! It was beautiful. The beds were actually very comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. Maid service daily did a great job picking up after our family. And turn down service left us a local candy on our night stands. The champagne, the cappucinno, and the milk chocolate were the best. The concierge night men were so friendly and helpful. They even had umbrellas to loan out, which was great since one of ours broke in the wind the first night. The only negative I have is the room service menues. The breakfast from Bacco's was just ok. And the night menu from the french restaurant was so limited none of us found anything at all interesting, which resulted in a quick walk to McDonald's instead. Completely and totally worth the money<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR126301624">The location of the Inn at the Market was great, right by the water and the Pike Street Market. We had a free upgrade to a waterfront room our first night at the Inn. The bellhops were great, and the front desk staff were very warm and inviting. However, the $35 dollars a day seemed a bit steep for valet parking (albeit the staff was very prompt in pulling our car up); was hoping there would be a cheaper parking alternative near by. However, when we checked out of the hotel (after a 3 day stay) we left our netbook, in a case, on the bed of the room. We did not realize it was gone till later in the day,but came rushing back to get it when we did. The laptop NEVER made it out of our room in our possession. It's "lost" and we are $600+ dollars in the hole. The staff made every attempt to find it, searching lost and found, the safe, sending out an e-mail to all staff etc. But we honestly feel it may have been taken from the room by housekeeping. We left very disheartened and angry. I have a feeling we won't be getting it back and someone has a nice new password protected netbook, (among other things in the netbook case) that they are going to have to reformat to be able to use. I called back to follow up with the manager once we returned. She said nothing was turned in. Also, she suggested I call the Washington State Ferry lost and found. I did, with no avail. I know the laptop never made it on the ferry, because it never made it to our car.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126229876">Stayed at Inn at the Market November 2011 for a Seattle Seahawks game. Spent 3 nights. Was truly the best location and best hotel I've stayed at in Seattle. Literally steps from Pike Place market make it perfect for early morning coffees overlooking the Sound. Was cold when we were there, so the deck you could sit on overlooking the Sound wasn't used, but its views were excellent. Valet parking was fast and efficient as well. Rooms were modern and clean as well. Great to be right on Post Alley as well and steps from Kells Irish Pub. Go there for great local bands. Also, we paid for the cheaper rooms and still had a great view of the Sound. Not sure why I'd pay more, but I'm sure it would be worth it. All in all, perfect hotel, perfect location.<topic>none</topic>

The bellhops were very friendly and helpful--had a challenge getting a cab when we checked out but not for lack of effort. The room is very average- smallish and the bed faces the wall rather than the entertainment cabinet which is a little unusual. Bed very comfortable, 5th floor patio not to be missed...we happily ate our piroshkys in a light drizzle for that fantastic view!<topic>none</topic>

The service was impeccable, Every employee that we came in contact with was polite and helpful. We knew that the weather would most likely not be that nice, but we still bundled up against the wind and cold and spent 2 evenings watching the sun set from the fabulous outdoor terrace. We booked a city view room, really wished we had booked a water view, but the property was full 2 of the nights so there wasn't an opportunity to upgrade. We were on the top floor, which was a wonderful bonus, but bring your earplugs, the night noise was pretty loud, especially after businesses closed on Saturday night (Sunday am). The short walk down the hill allowed for perfect access to Pike Place Market and the shops and restaurants of the area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125818039">We were coming to the end of our trip and it was nice to be welcomed by the lovely staff at the Inn. The hotel was in a great spot for pike markets and was a close walk to the centre of town with all the shopping. All the staff were fantastic. We didnâ€™t realise that most tourist activities didnâ€™t run in winter however Katie went out of her way to help us try and find a tour to the boeing factory for my partner who really wanted to go there. We were fortunate to be able to change our rooms after the first night to a water view room and the view was stunning. It was so nice to watch the sun set over the water. Huge Bathroom which was very clean. The one small down side was the area of the hotel and not with the hotel itself which I have marked down the location below. As tourists we walked everywhere, returning home from town at night was a little bit daunting sometimes as there were quite a few people that hang around pike and pine street in groups. Sometimes I didnâ€™t feel 100% safe and had to catch cabs however everything is super closed so cabs were ver cheap.<topic>none</topic>

We were there in August for a wedding ( about the only month you can plan an outdoor event) and the town is slammed with cruise ship tourists as thats the height of their season too. Don't even try to rent a car, - ridiculous parking rates and fees for downtown spots. We stayed at The Inn at the Market and loved the proxicimity to waterfront, ferries to out islands, museums and shops. Tasteful rooms, very clean. Just make sure you get a waterview room- worth the extra$ because the view is awesome. They also have a great rooftop deck for afternoons of wine and cheese from Bechlers at the corner.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125558857">We visit Seattle at least twice a year, and The Inn at the Market has been our hotel of choice for a very long time. The reasons are many: the rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated/ furnished, and quiet. A trip to the hotel's rooftop deck is a must for a panoramic view of Elliott Bay. The staff is welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate their guests..."welcome back!" is the usual greeting when we arrive. The Inn's prime location is a short walk to the Seattle Art Museum, the Seattle Symphony, shopping and many fine restaurants, including Cafe Campagne and Marche, both located on-site.

<comment category="positive" id="UR125474305">I have stayed at the Inn at the Market on more than one occasion, mainly because I enjoy being close to the Public Market when I am in Seattle. This is an older "boutique" hotel, so the rooms are not exactly large, but they are kept clean and tidy, although the furnishing are a bit dated but are in keeping with the style of the hotel. The front desk staff for the most part is quite helpful, especially at arranging a limo (at a good price) to and from the airport or for other excursions. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side (average room is probably about $250 a night), but if you are lucky enough to get a room with a view of the market and Elliott Bay, then it's worth it. If you get a "garden view" (which may mean a view of a brick wall) then not so much. The best aspect of this hotel is its location!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125427834">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights last week, 2/24/12. We had a wonderful experience. I chose the hotel based on it's location, I had never stayed at a "boutique" type hotel so didn't know what to expect. Our room was exceptional, we stayed in room 808 which offers a great view of the market and of Puget Sound. I don't think we could have asked for a better room. The service from everyone at the hotel was oustanding, I have never experienced this level of customer service, and I have stayed at numerous hotels. Everyone is s0 incredibly nice, and it's genuine! From the desk clerks to Andrew who gave us a ride to the Space Needle, everyone was provided steller customer service. Since we didn't have out own vehicle, we appreciated having the hotel town car available to give us a ride. If I had to find fault with anything it would probably be that the water pressure to fill the bath tub is a little slow. Other than that it was perfect. I would caution those traveling with kids, this is a boutique hotel which means that it does not offer some of the amenities that your larger resort style hotesl offer, ie, pool, spa, etc. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it. I fear that I'm ruined for any other hotel.<topic>none</topic>

After the long drive back to Seattle through the mountains, the hotel was a welcome comfort. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted in front of the hotel by the friendly valet attendant who also assisted us with our bags into the lobby. At check in, we were happy to hear that we got a complimentary upgrade to our room. The room was clean, plenty of space, and upon entering, we noticed the beautiful view looking out onto the Puget Sound, and it just so happened to be sunset. Our king size bed was lush and enveloped us in goose down comforter and pillows. Our bathroom, also spacious was immaculate and well appointed. We had plenty of room in the hotel fridge to store our small amount of travel snacks and drinks. The concierge was helpful in suggesting a place to eat, and we explored the area surrounding the hotel, which happens to be smack in the middle of the Public Market at Pike Place. Tons to see, tons of places to shop, eat and grab coffee. We even enjoyed an after dinner stroll on the outdoor garden of the hotel which is safely perched up on the 5th floor. If it had been warmer, I would have loved to have pre dinner drinks on this deck. Check out went smoothly and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124931672">My husband and I were in Seattle last 8-12 January to train under Jason Prefontaine, from whom we bought a custom made Slayer espresso machine for our coffee shop. After perusing the reviews of various Seattle hotels here on Trip Advisor, I decided to book us at the Inn at the Market. We were very pleased with our choice! Our room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the water, the bed was quite comfortable, enough to make it difficult to get up in the mornings. The bathroom was clean and spacious, stocked daily with Gilchrist &amp; Soames toiletries. My only beef with the bathroom was that the shower was incorporated into the tub, it was just a little bit inconvenient, but it didn't detract from the quality of our stay. Housekeeping was quite thorough, our room was always well cleaned daily. The door men were always amiable and helpful, and so were the front desk staff. The hotel had no restaurants, but it was within a little courtyard that also included the superb Cafe Campagne which served lovely French cuisine (We had dinner two nights in a row!); Bacco, a cafe that was only open for breakfast, which was quite satisfying; and Marche which we patronized every night for desert and drinks after dinner. There were also some interesting looking shops and a salon in the courtyard which I was never able to visit because by the time we would get back from training, they were all closed. The staff at Cafe Campagne and Marche were very friendly and helpful. We thought my husband left his cellphone at Marche on our last night and the staff helped him turn the place around to search for it.

The Inn's location is wonderful with Pike Place Market and 1st Avenue so close; lots to see and do. The rooms are large and full of light, the bed was wonderfully comfortable, and staff were helpful and friendly. We had reserved a city view room but when they found it was our anniversary, gave us a free upgrade to a water view room - and a deliciious chocolate dessert in our room. The rooftop deck expands the view even more and is a great place to spend time.

<comment category="positive" id="UR124835510">My husband and I stayed February 12th until February 15th, 2012. We had a water view room at the rate of $245 per night/ $855 with tax. The room was clean and the staff terrific. We had a poorly operating coffee pot and it was immediately replaced with one that worked. The pillows were too soft, so we asked if we could have an extra one. The staff immediately came up with two tempurpedic pillows. I was impressed. When we got home we were asked by management to take a survey regarding our stay. I happened to mention the refusal of the Orange Cab driver, who took us to the airport, to give us the flat rate of $32, as stated on the cab's passenger window and confirmed by another cab driver, who had told us rates are metered when coming FROM the airport but charged a flat rate when GOING to the airport. Our cab driver stated we needed a form, provided by the hotel, in order to get the rate. Not true! I had also researched cab fares on the internet before leaving home. The manager of the Inn at the Market advised he would refer this cab incident to the transporation authority. I also sent an e-mail to Orange Cab advising I would not use their company in the future. I have not heard back for them---Go figure. Anyway, the only negative I have regarding our stay was the decor of our room. I actually laid in bed thinking a change in the pictures on the wall and the curtains would help. The room has a bit of a tired look and not pulled together. I also had an issue with the blower on the heater. It is winter and it is possible dust was blown into the air, as my eyes instantly acted up, when the heater went on. Would I stay there again or even recommend the hotel to friends--of course. You can't beat the location and everyone was happy to please. I also appreciated the secure office center, in order to print up our boading passes.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124581830">This place spends its money where it counts-the beds are fantastic, the sheets divine, the pillows cloud-like...and of course, the location can't be beat. But frankly, that is all that recommends the place--outside of what I mentioned, the rooms are rather plebeian, at best. We had a street side room, which was tiny, and the water pressure SUcked--could barely rinse my hair. The bathrooms need a make-over--they look like what they probably are--spiffied-up Holiday Innish. At the very least, make sure that the fixtures aren't falling off the wall. We had a TERRible tip from front desk staff about where to go to eat, so don't bother asking--they either don't know or they get a kickback--either way, they are not to be trusted. WE paid $160 a night, including valet parking, which for the location (and those sheets and bed--ahhhhh) still seemed reasonable for Seattle. Yes, I'd go back--just for the sleep and location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124544360">Absolutely love the central location - close to bus routes and shopping. The view can't be beat and the bed is absolutely the most comfortable one we have had. Staff is wonderful. Walking distance to our planned evening activity at the Triple Door. Thanks for a wonderfully relaxing and comfortable Valentine getaway! Can't wait ot come back!!! The only thing that could make this even more special would be more coffee in the room and a hot tub on the deck!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124174916">First of all let me say that the location is not to be believed. Literally steps from the Pike Place Market and close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The first night here was a bit rough as we had a city view room (only room available at the time of my reservation). Well, it's not a view as much as a room facing 1st street. It was very loud. Traffic noise until way past 1am! Needless to say I was "Sleepless in Seattle". The next morning I called the front desk and luckily they were able to move us to a "Courtyard Room". Much better! This was a bigger room and quiet. The rooms are comfortable and modest in size-the bed was excellent. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. There is no gym or pool on the property which is a negative for my family but they do give you a free pass to a local gym. Coffee and tea are provided in the lobby in the morning and apples and cookies are on a plate by the front desk in the afternoon. There are 2 restaurants you can order room service from but no children's menu or child friendly food. Luckily, there are so many restaurants close by we were able to get what we needed. Nice rooftop patio area to enjoy the view. I guess this review is fairly neutral-It's a nice hotel BUT...after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor I guess I was just expecting more.<topic>none</topic>

Room service offers some of the Seattle's finest food, but you're also only a few feet from all the treats of Pike's Market and environs.

<comment category="positive" id="UR121959951">I booked a weekend at the Inn at the Market based on a friendâ€™s recommendation. Their Counter Staff were the best and most personable I have met at any Hotel world-wide. I left my "liquids bag" at TSA and asked about replacements at the desk. I received mini-Shaving cream, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Deodorant, and Razor. Yippeee! The Hotel overlooks Pike Place Market. (From my â€œWater Viewâ€� room, I could see Puget Sound, the Pike Place Fish Market and the fish being thrown by Pike Place Fish. On the other hand, "City View" rooms have only a view of a few downtown Seattle buildings.) The beds were comfy. There was even an umbrella in the closet if needed. The Hotel is easy to find. From the Airport via Light Rail the Station it is five blocks away straight down Pine St. at the intersection with 1st Ave. Valet Parking is available if you drive. There is plenty to do, see, and eat, within walking distance. This is an excellent Hotel without being pretentious from the Doorman right down to the Maids.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121950033">I won a quick trip to Seattle from Vancouver, B.C. through Seattle Holidays and CKNW radio. The trip included two nights at Inn at the Market, dinner at El Gaucho Steak, a Savor Seattle Tour of Pike Market and lunch at Purple. We loved our room at Inn at the Market. The trip was for 2 but I called and said I had two children and they gladly up graded me to a market view room at no charge. This room was a corner room on the 4th floor over looking Pine street and Pike Market. I was impressed with the ease of finding the Hotel and the valet parking and check in was a breeze. The special touches of apples, candy canes, hot cider and fresh cookies in the lobby really put the personal touch on our stay. The in room coffee and newspaper at the door were a bonus. I would recommend this hotel for familys, singles or couples. It was a wonderful trip of bonding and fun with my two young teens. They had fun with their mom.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121946598">The location of Inn at the Market is absolutely perfect! This is the most central you can feel in Seattle. Short walk to shopping and dining destinations, or anything downtown. My partial water view room was large and had a great water view (better than "partial") looking over and past the 5th floor roof deck. This was a free, unrequested upgrade from a City Side room, by the way. The hotel offers great dining options onsite. Room service menu is outstanding. The sheets and pillows are high quality. Lobby is quite small, so it wouldn't be a good choice if you are trying to hold business chats or other get togethers in the lobby area of your hotel. Overall, if you want a very Seattle feeling hotel with great ambiance and staff, this is the best choice.<topic>none</topic>

Have been to Seattle several times, stayed in several places, but if you have limited time, and really want to treat yourself, this is your best choice... Location, location, location... The Pike Market is at your doorstep, the central district is a two block walk, the waterfront is at your doorstep, and a gorgeous deck provides a private outlook over the sound (feels like your own personal back yard-sadly, the clerk forgot to mention it to me when I checked in, but after a couple days, I asked "where is the rooftop looking place you featured in your ad' and was directed to it) ...A basket of apples awaits you at the front desk, spacious rooms, vey comfy beds, usual ipod docking alarm clock, extremely helpful concierge and staff, willing valets for parking... only drawbacks are a function of the small size and intimacy - no spa, no workout room, the business center is a small room with only two computers (may mean a short wait)...

<comment category="positive" id="UR121555075">I had high expectations of this hotel after reading so many positive reviews on Trip Advisor and seeing photos. The hotel itself in terms of the building and decor were not quite what I expected; it was very understated and minimal. This isn't necessarily bad, just not what I expected. However, everything was impeccably clean. What really sets this hotel apart from many is the outstanding SERVICE that they give. Everyone was exceedingly friendly and any service you could hope for was immediately undertaken. Through their use of earpiece communication they could make sure that information was relayed almost the instant you request it. Being in the high end hospitality industry myself, this is the level of service I expect to see when going to other high end establishments. Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and pleasant when bypassing in the hall, not scampering away or hiding behind service trucks. We dined at both Marche and Bacco, their on-site restaurants. Both were very good if not excellent. Bottom line, if you want great service with a clean room and excellent location, this is your hotel. If you relish in the opulence of typical 4- and 5- star hotels, this might not be a great fit for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121352901">Sadly I was only in Seattle one night - I had never been to the city before so I wanted to stay somewhere that was in the middle of things, that way I could see as much I as could in the short time I was there. The Inn at the Market has a great location - right at Pike's Place Market and surrounded by great places to eat and very close to LOTS of shopping (which makes every girl happy :) ) The room was very clean, the bed was SOOOO comfortable, and the people in the hotel couldn't have been nicer. I did the valet parking (work was paying, so why not?) which wasn't much more than the nearby lots and very convenient - so even if I was paying for it I would have done it. When I needed my car I just called down to the lobby a few minutes before I planned to leave and my car was waiting right there for me when I came downstairs. When you first walk in, the lobby is very warm and inviting. Any and all questions I had were answered by the people working the desk and they were extremely helpful. I had a light lunch at (what I think was called) the Pear Deli around the corner. It was just a cute little deli with a couple of little tables and my sandwich was awesome. For dinner that night I went over to the restaurant across the street (whose name escapes me - but the guy at the front desk recommended) and it was amazing. I took a nice long walk all through the market and then up towards the center of town where there were lots of cool shops and cool people. After having a great meal and a nice stroll I came back to my room to see that my bed had been turned down, complete with chocolates (not on the pillow, but on the desk next to the bed lol) I had to do some work (Which is why I was there in the first place - Boo!) but when I was finally able to go to bed, the bed couldn't have been more comfortable. Slept great, got out on time to go to my meeting and then was off to the airport. If/when I go to Seattle again (I hope it's more a question of 'when' since I would have loved to explore the city for more than a couple of hours) I would absolutely stay at the Inn at the Market.<topic>none</topic>

The Inn is beautiful and has a one of a kind feel. The location is close to perfect and after your stay whenever you see the market in picture or on television you are guaranteed to feel a bit of nostalgia. It is withing walking distance to many of Seattle's attractions. Unlike a lot of hotels/ inns it has a very unique feel to it and a bit more personality than the rest. The staff is always willing to help and offer advice... with a big smile. We had two nights here and it was definitely not enough! Hope to be back one day soon.

<comment category="positive" id="UR121231001">I have a married niece who lives in Seattle. When I first visited Seattle in order to see her and her then new husband, she and I discussed the hotel possibilities. Of the two or three obvious choices I chose the Inn. I have visited Seattle every year since 2001 and I stay at the Inn as a matter of course. It is a small boutique hotel. its presentation is outstandingly good. Its facilities are first rate. It has no restaurant, but in the same building is Bacco, an excellent place for breakfast, and Campagna, a restaurant seving food of a quality that I have never found to be less than excellent. Its location is ideal: a stone's throw from the celebrated Pike Place Market; surrounded by very good places to eat, (try the recently opened Diner across the street from the main entrance to the Inn); within a comfortable walk from the Seattle Museum of Art and Benaroya Hall, the home of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. A walk of a couple of blocks reaches the monorail that travels back and forth between the Westlake Centre downtown and the Seattle Centre, which contins, among much else, the Seattle Opera and the Pacific North West Ballet. The staff are uniformly agreeable and efficient. The air conditioner in my room was a bit noisy, but given the outside temperatures in November, I didn't mind. I simply warmed the room well and before turning out the light at bedtime, and turned off the A/C while I slept. A top choice<topic>none</topic>

A perfect place to sip a glass of wine and look at the pike place market sign and the sound. You can't beat the location. There are tons of restaurants near by.

<comment category="negative" id="UR120848799">Right on top of Pike's Market and close to the 'waterfront' shopping - this hotel is small and convenient, comfortable and cozy. It is not 'the best' - but, it is perfect for 1 or 2 nights stay. Rooms are a little dated and cookie-cutter and bordering on boring - beds are comfortable, bathrooms are functional - but, the hotel overall lacks any signature features or stand-out elements. Service was friendly (Noel was wonderful, and the valet service was speedy and efficient) - however, the hotel needs an injection of warmth and personality.

<comment category="negative" id="UR120553707">I am baffled by all the five star reviews this hotel has gotten. It has a great location and the bellman/valet personnel are wonderful, but the hotel overall is average. Nothing special about the service or the hotel. It is a small, somewhat tired property and we were surprised to find ourselves in the handicapped room. The front desk attendant failed to ask if this was acceptable (which, in my experience, is always usually done...even at the Hampton Inn level hotel). My husband couldn't get his head under the shower head without bending over and since it was the handicapped "removable" type shower head it had trouble staying in place. It would slip out of the holder and proceed to flood the bathroom floor since there was no shower ledge separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom floor. We wouldn't stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119970269">After 10 days in Alaska we ended our trip in Seattle before flying home. We decided to spring for a water view room and boy were we glad we did. The Pike Street Market sign and Puget Sound were beautiful from our window. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Our room was very nice, well appointed and surprisingly quiet considering the location. We loved watching the sunset from the roof terrace. We had breakfast in the cafe and it was delicious. Maybe the best quiche I have ever had anywhere, including home. The room rate is a little steep, but it's worth every penny. You are definitely paying for location and service. We loved the Steelhead Diner right across the street from the hotel. We sat at the bar which was a great place to people watch. The food was great and the atmosphere very pleasant. There are lots of places to shop and eat, but it's a pretty good walk to the water's edge, and once you get there you won't find too much to do - a couple of restaurants and great views. We can't imagine staying anyplace else if we ever go back. The hotel and surrounds were exceptional.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119953638">This is THE place to stay if you want to be in the middle of the market scene in Seattle. It's delightful to wake up early and walk among the market stalls while the vendors are just setting up. We were fortunate to have gorgeous fall weather when we stayed here in mid-October. We did have a little trouble getting in. The room was not ready at 4 p.m., the normal check-in time, but we couldn't really complain because when we came back at 4:30 the room was ready and we had been upgraded to a suite with a perfect view of the iconic market sign, Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains beyond. This was a suite on two floors, with a large living room and kitchen downstairs and a spacious master bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Bed was very comfortable with great reading lights. We caught the beautiful sunset from the hotel's rooftop deck, where a lot of folks were sharing glasses of wine and snapping photos of the view. This is a great base for exploring Seattle. We walked down First Avenue to the Seattle Art Museum's sculpture park near Belltown and then walked back on the waterfront. Had breakfast at Seatown, one of Tom Douglas's newer restaurants, with an emphasis on smoked fish. Also walked the other direction, toward Pioneer Square, and of course checked out the fish, produce and craft stalls in the market itself. My only small caution would be that if you are looking for peace and quiet, this is probably not the place you want to be. The traffic noise from the viaduct below was quite loud all night even though I had my earplugs in. And the market action starts early so if you are a light sleeper you may have trouble sleeping in.<topic>none</topic>

We booked a water view room and were upgraded to a deluxe water view room. It was fantastic.

Since it was so large, the few lamps at either end of the room did not provide enough light for the middle of the room where the closet was. Also when I stay in luxury hotels, I do expect the bathroom to be way above standard - this one was large, but not with much useful space. There were no drawers/shelves to put toiletries. Also the water pressure was so low. Although there was a nice size tub, it would have taken forever to use it. Plus the shower head had little pressure and was not adjustable so rinsing my long hair took a good amount of time. For the last part of our stay we stayed in a smaller room with a city view. It was really nice - clean comfortable and very well lit. Also the bathroom had shelving to put toiletries and the shower head was adjustable so it felt like more water pressure due to its setting. The hotel overall was magnificent - itâ€™s customer service was everything Iâ€™d expect from itâ€™s ratings. Also it location was great. Iâ€™d definitely recommend this hotel. While the view from the water suite was outstanding, Iâ€™d probably only book it again with a great deal because the smaller room was really nice and I liked itâ€™s bathroom better.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119635124">We stayed at the Inn for a weekend in the middle of September. Even though the hotel is in the front of the famous Pike Market, it is very peaceful and quiet. Our double bed ocean view room on the fifth floor was comfortable, very clean and generous in size. All employees at the hotel are very friendly, helpful and caring. The hotel has a small cute courtyard and a rooftop terrace with amazing ocean and city views. The location is a perfect base for exploring the old and new Seattle. We love everything about the Inn and will definitely come back !<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119594616">We stayed at the IATM twice on our recent holiday to the USA, on arrival &amp; on our last night. We arrived at the hotel much earlier than check in time but this wasn't an issue, although our room wasn't quite ready, the receptionist took our mobile number &amp; promised to call us as soon as the room became available, the concierge took care of our luggage and that left us free to stretch our legs, explore and grab a coffee after enduring a 10 hour flight to Seattle. We were in our city view room within the hour &amp; were not disappointed, clean, bright, spacious &amp; wonderful comfy king size bed. After a couple of hours rest, we popped out &amp; bought a bottle of wine and sat enjoying the uninterrupted views of Elliott Bay from the terrace (this is such a bonus). At the end of the evening we returned to our room and housekeeping had replaced the towels, turned down our bed and left us a couple of chocolates, this was a lovely gesture. When we returned to the hotel for our last night we had chosen a room with water view, given that the terrace is available to enjoy the water view, we felt this was an over indulgence, as the room itself (apart from the view) offered nothing more than the city view room, just we payed an extra $76 dollars for the priviledge. All the staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them, if we returned to Seattle we'd certainly consider staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119555309">I booked reservations at this hotel because of the responses of manager, David Watkins. I thought someone who cared that much to respond to every trip advisor comment, truly cared about his hotel. He does! This comes across through every single employee, from the second you arrive at the hotel. Everybody employee comes across as happy. Happy to be there, happy to be of assistance, happy to recommend great places for dinner. The rooms were beautiful with fantastic views. The beds are tough to get out of! High quality bedding was wonderful and almost worth spending all day in. My only con...low flow shower. Great for the environment (not for a good shower!) Regardless, I will chose this hotel for my stay, every time I come to Seattle!! Well done, David!!!! Many thanks!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119518870">and had booked the inn on TA reviews. We arrived very early and tired, the 4PM check in is always an irritant, however, Paul , at the front desk was very considerate concerning our request to check in early and got us right into a room,we will not forget this gesture. The hotel is located in prime tourist friendly territory, and staff were all excellent, helpful, courteous, professional...hotel is very clean, well decorated and very well kept and updated, looked as if it had been recently painted. The terrace on the 5th floor is wonderful, and that is a real plus at this property on warm days of course. Our only complaint ....and we are I am sure much more noise sensitvie than most folks...was the street noise. We had a city view room, the least expensive, and I wish we had been forewarned or I had asked, we might have upgraded. Windows are good sound proof windows but takes alot to drown out buses and motocycles, even from the 5th floor. We had to take sleeping pills in the end. But this was the only complaint...bath was super clean, supplies plentiful and coffee service always available..DOwntown hotels are always expensive, so it was a splurge for us.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119333132">This was a special trip so we booked a "water view" King room. Fabulous!! Floor to ceiling windows that opened onto a view of Pike Place Market below and Elliott Bay beyond. The room was large with plenty of storage space and comfortable furniture. And the bed is the most luxurious I've ever slept in--helped, of course, by high-quality bedding and fluffy comforter. Every single staff person we interacted with was friendly and helpful. I had occasion to talk to 2 young men during our stay and they both said that they were proud to work for the hotel because of its fine reputation and quality. That says a lot about a place and about the management. If you're considering a stay at this hotel I encourage you to look at the website. It's an accurate representation of the facility, the rooms, and the attitude. I suppose that the location---right across from the vibrant and fascinating Pike Place Market--might not appeal to everyone, but we loved it. Within 2 blocks of the hotel you can find a choice of good coffee shops and a terrific French Bakery. There are a lot of hotels that deserve an "excellent" rating, often for different combinations of qualities and circumstances. Our experience at The Inn At The Market ranked it among the best hotels we've ever stayed in.<topic>none</topic>

The stay was most memorable when my traveling companion and I ran into Katie from the front desk staff with a plate of gourmet cupcakes in the elevator. We casually commented how great they looked, and returned to our rooms later that day to find a message saying there was "something" special at the desk for us. Katie and her staff went out a purchased a variety of delicious cupcakes and had them delivered to our rooms! The room with a bay view is a must, and worth the small additional cost. The facilities are is pristine condition, and the location in the heart of the Pike/Public Market There is no doubt that I will be returning the the Inn At the Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119235466">Incredibly pleasant boutique hotel w. a relaxing, casual vibe. 70 rms &amp; compact design promotes easy in &amp; out and all about... no crowds, lines, waits, long corridors or elevator rides... even on a booked weekend, hassle-free! Cut above feature... Outstanding location (Pike Market seems central to everything) and unique, local fare practically outside the door... had fresh crumpets w. honey-butter, ricotta &amp; walnuts every morning! Also, there's "award-winning" clam chowder (serves a 4 chowder sampler... great oyster chowder &amp; seafood bisque) and a "world famous" fresh macaroni &amp; cheese shop... heaven! The other exemplary feature... staff is outstanding... 5 star service. Standard rooms are small-ish, but our 5th flr "city view" actually had views of both city &amp; ocean... nice! My personal draw... faux balcony windows open completely and the 5th flr also has a large, rooftop, lounging deck w. beautiful views. Non-smoking hotel... but smoking ok on rooftop or hotel's front door courtyard. Contemporary decor could use a slight freshen and it's not cheap... crowd skews older. Depending on your budget &amp; taste, highly recommend!<topic>none</topic>

This was our first visit to Seattle and I wouldn't change a thing about our visit! It is in the Pike Place Market which is a fun venue. We did quite a bit of traveling around the city and whenever we mentioned that we were staying at the Inn at the Market, everyone knew the property and confirmed that we had picked a city treasure. The hotel has the fabulous 5th floor patio which can't be missed and an inviting courtyard within the market area.

<comment category="positive" id="UR117009616">Glowing reviews are usually suspect, but this place certainly deserves it. The location is half a block from Pike Market, and a short walk from the light rail from the airport. Our room faced the bay and was pretty much perfect - quiet, with a separate sitting room and a view to die for. The bathroom was fairly large and the bed really, really comfortable. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful. They give you the choice of two newspapers or, if you want, both. The only complaints (if you even want to call them that) is 1) no turn down service (a surprise at such a nice place) and 2) the television is in a weird place, sort of on the side of the bed. Picky, picky, picky... This hotel is not cheap, but for a couple of extra bucks it definitely is worth it. We can not imagine staying elsewhere in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116953529">This boutique hotel was our first introduction to the Pacific Northwest and we loved it. It's located just a block from Pikes Market, a wonderful place to people watch, eat, shop, etc. The hotel is through a pretty courtyard with some nice specialty shops opening on to it. The lobby is small and rather plain, but the rooms were lovely. We looked out on the courtyard and didn't miss having a water view at all. Upstairs was a rooftop terrace with nice lounge chairs and tables where we could spend time looking at Puget sound and visiting with other guests. We didn't use the restaurant affiliated with the hotel so can't comment on that but the menu looked great. The room itself had everything we needed - extremely comfortable beds, lovely bathroom, TWO floor-length mirrors (one inside the bath, one outside - that's a frequently lacking item even in top hotels), comfortable chairs. It was spotless - and I'm picky. Would go back in a heartbeat!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116874615">My wife and I stayed at the Inn at the Market for three nights in the second week in August and wished it could have been longer. After a long day of driving up the Oregon coast we arrived late to a courteous staff and found in our room a complimentary bottle of wine. I had booked a city view room but found I had been upgraded to a partial water view. The room was superb, not extremely large but very luxurious. The bed and linens were great though the pillows are very soft. The bathroom is nicely updated and always very clean. I did have some trouble with the shower as the showerhead was a little low but not everyone will have the same issue. The soaps and shampoos are on par with other fine hotels weâ€™ve stayed at. The staff was professional, helpful and provided good advice on how to get places. The Inn provides numerous snacks and drinks in the room for purchase which didnâ€™t seem overpriced, wireless internet is free, and the complimentary New York or Los Angeles Times is a great touch. Itâ€™s been mentioned in just about every review but the location cannot be beat and it worth the price of the room. It allows you to go to the market before it gets busy, and is close walking distance to everything but the Space Needle and Safeco. The rooftop deck will make you realize that youâ€™ve spent your money wisely as you get to enjoy what makes Seattle a great city. I would advise going to Piroshky Piroshky for breakfast and Beecherâ€™s Cheeses for lunch as they are right around the corner and taking both up to the rooftop deck to enjoy a great view and better meal. Overall we were greatly impressed with the luxury and professionalism of the Inn at the Market, would recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle and will stay there upon our return.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116820532">This was the first part of our West Coast trip and what a great hotel. Beds were great, nice staff, and a brilliant start to a lot of sightseeing. The rooms are not huge but big enough, but overall the location makes this place and its worth the extra sterling for access to the market, ferries, and walking into the shopping areas. With little onsite, the hotel makes use of surrounding facilities which is nice if, like us, you like to get out of the hotel - the surrounding bistro, cafe etc can bill to your room, even though it feels like you have got out and about already (as opposed to the welcome but generic 'Marrisson' scrambled egg fare. Parking is not cheap, but then when is it in central US cities - there are plenty nearby that are cheaper if you don't need the car much. Overall, would definitely go again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116818745">My husband and I had seen the Inn at the Market a few years ago on vacation and had decided that we would like to stay there on our next visit so I really looked forward to staying at this hotel which is directly across the street from Pike Place Market. But I was truly disappointed. Although the Bellman were superb, the front desk personnel and concierge were sorely lacking in being service-oriented. When asking for a suggestion of a nearby restaurant, I had to ask several questions just to get the name of one restaurant across the street which had a 2.5 hour wait and had been told by this front desk rep that we would not need reservations. On a few occasions during our two-day stay, one of us asked for suggestions and it was like pulling teeth just to get a suggestion. They were never rude but just not helpful as you might expect from personnel at a fine hotel. I'm sorry to leave such a terrible review which I RARELY do but I would not go back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116689880">After reading the various reviews from many travel websites, including TA, I chose to make reservations at this quaint boutique hotel because of its location adjacent to Pike's Place Market. The only downside to being in this crowded vicinity was that the site of the hotel was on a very small lot sandwiched between stores and other apartment buildings. It just felt a little too claustrophobic. The compensation for this dilemma is the wonderful common balcony area on the second floor which overlooked Pike's Place Market partially and afforded a full view of Seattle Harbor. On the flipside, because of the location, it was very convenient to grab meals anytime of the day because of the various delis and restaurants in the area. Also, it was walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters and not to mention, the original Starbucks just down the hill. Be wary, though, of the many panhandlers and homeless when walking about. If you have a car, there is no self parking unless, you can find a public parking garage somewhere close by, otherwise the hotel has valet service and there is a parking charge of about $30.00 per night. Despite the fact that the location is in a busy neighborhood, the noise factor was remarkably not an issue, especially since we were on the second floor overlooking the street and stores. We had a room with double beds and ample room for a family with 2 active boys. It was clean and neat, but nothing spectacular. I thought the staff were cordial enough and helpful, but not overly helpful. The place exuded a very low key ambiance. Maybe it was the dim lighting or the fire place in the lobby that contributed to the effect. Overall, the room was decent, the hotel was small, the location was adequate, the atmosphere was sublime and the staff were professional. The room rate is perhaps justified because of the location at Pike's Place Market where everything seems to be overpriced. Not that I had an unpleasant experience at Inn at the Market, mind you, but I probably would try another hotel in Seattle, just for the change in scenery.<topic>none</topic>

The location is just steps from the market which is great for walking to grab breakfast and dinner and is also close to catch the monorail to some of the activities in the city. The patio for the guests was great. The only improvement we'd like to see is a larger bathroom as it was extremely small and cramped. Other than that the two level suite was great.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116591430">There is a lot that is fantastic about Inn at the Market. If you're on a pleasure/vacation trip, you cannot beat the location - on the edge of the market but still quiet and relaxing once you're in your room. The staff is fantastic - everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful above and beyond normal niceness. The room we had was quite large and our view of the Sound was absolutely dreamy. Worth noting though, our room had very few outlets which were in awkward places for charging devices (computers, cell phones, etc). And there is no desk in the room. The most inconvenient and impactful problem though was that our room (704) was very close to the exhaust fan of the restaurant below. So, it smelled intensely like eggs (breakfast) and then steak (lunch/dinner) the entire time the restaurant was open. This seems like something the hotel should be aware of and should really correct, especially for being one of the upgraded water-view rooms.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR78273397">This was our first trip to Seattle. We came a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We picked the Inn at the Market from pictures and reviews on the internet, as well as its close proximity to the Pike Place Market. We were very impressed with our first impression of the Inn at the Market. The great view of the main entrance of the Pike Place Market, the attractive garden courtyard, and the sleek style of the front lobby. Landon met us at our cab and took custody of all of our bags. We met Noelle at the front counter. Although we were early for our check in time, she took our cell phone number to let us know when our room was ready. We were both incredibly impressed with her extremely friendly attitude and helpful manner. You could tell that she was just a genuinely nice person, and that she wasn't just being polite because it was an obligation for her position. Landon was very professional as well, introduced himself further at the check in desk, and arranged for our bags to be stored so we could begin to see Seattle. When we returned a little while later, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that we had been upgraded to a two story townhouse suite. The room was lovely, and had a stunning city view of the corner of Pine and 1st St. (great for people watching!!). I don't recall the name of the bellhop who brought our luggage to our room, but he was extremely polite and helpful as well. He filled our ice bucket before leaving. We were actually SAD that we had to leave the next day to go on our cruise!! Both Seattle and the Inn at the Market greatly exceeded our expectations. We hope to return soon, and will plan to stay at the Inn at the Market again. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Seattle. It is located right at the entrance to Pike Place Market. The market is interesting, a wonderful place to pick up some handmade souvenirs by local artists, and a terrific place to try different ethnic foods. Within walking distance - The first Starbucks, The Seattle Aquarium, The Westlake Center Mall, a major bus / train stop (at the mall), Piroshky Piroshky (Russian pastries at the market), Pike Place Chowder (at the market), Le Panier (French pastries at the market). A helpful hint: You can take the train to and from Sea-Tac Airport for $2.50 a person one way. Much cheaper than the $45 fare from the airport or the $35 fare to the airport. It is really easy to use too... just go to the bottom floor of the mall. You can also catch the monorail from the top floor of the mall... we did not take this, but you can go to the Space Needle using this (cheaper than a taxi also). .<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6802179">My husband and I stayed at this Hotel for several days. We felt that it was an Awesome place to stay as well as a Great Location! The hotel is right up the street from the Public Market. It makes for easy walking to many of the places in the area where you can eat and also close to the waterfront. The room was nice and the bed (a tempurpedic) was like heaven. I almost hated getting out of it in the mornings! They have a town car and if it is available they will pick you up or take you wherever you might need to go. We used it on the way back to the Amtrak station. I found this out because I had e-mailed them with some questions. I indicated that we were celebrating an Anniversary and the day after we checked in they delivered to us some chocolate covered strawberries, decorated really cute as an Anniversary treat! I thought that was a really nice touch. The Deck on the 5th floor was a nice place to checkout the surrounding area of Seattle. You get a really Great View from the space needle but spending some "down time" on the deck was a nice option for us. We did a lot of walking and really enjoyed our time while we were there.

Front desk staff are friendly and try to be helpful. Room smelled of tobacco though it is supposed to be non-smoking room. 2 glasses in the bathroom were chipped or cracked! Quite unexpected for a highly rated hotel. Didn't find the bed all that special too... Didn't find the deck very fantastic....maybe coz it's winter and the winds were too strong to stay in the deck for long.... Room-wise it is a very average 3 star. Hotel wise it has a great location next to the market but that's about it. Was expecting more for the high price....<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6612057">My husband and I stayed here last weekend for one night. I had spent some time trying to find a great place to stay in Seattle. Read the tripadvisor reviews, saw that it was listed in T&amp;L Top 500 hotels, etc. Seemed like a pretty good bet it would be a fantastic place. It was great, fine...but just not really the amazing little boutique hotel I'd expected from the reviews and ratings. We thought the room was nice, but again, not incredible. The service could have been better too. The woman at the front desk was very friendly, but got a few things wrong. On another note -- if you are visiting Seattle, try to eat at Canlis. We had an incredible meal there!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6568643">My husband and I thought this an attractive little hotel. Rooms were on the small side, but nicely furnished. The rooftop garden deck was a nice photo-op, but too breezy in Sept. for lounging. Also, getting service for a glass of wine was a major undertaking. We finally had to go to the bar next door, order it, then come back and wait for the bellboy to deliver it. Didn't need a hassle after a long flight! Would probably stay elsewhere next time. Perhaps the Fairmont.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6549233">The valet parking is helpful, but as you can expect downtown, it was pricey($24/night, i think). The lobby is modest but comfortable - you'll note that there are no pictures of the lobby on the website, because it's not much of a selling point. The courtyard, however, was quaint and quite pleasant. The fountain is relaxing, and the brick facade with the hanging ivy is a beautiful entry. I had a courtyard view room at the 4th floor, which has no view of Elliot Bay. I think you need to be at the 6th or higher for a bay view. The room was enormous and comfortable, and the bathroom is spacious. The ceilings were high, as expected of an older building. The bed was a king size Tempurpedic, as advertised. If you've never slept in a Tempurpedic, I must say that it is similar to an Asian hotel experience - the bed seems very hard at first, but gradually (slowly) forms to your shape, for a rested sleep - it just doesn't seem like it at first! The restaurant, Campagne, is an excellent (though smallish) French style restaurant, with a good wine selection, particularly the dessert wines (if there's any remaining, try the Cuvee Boytrytis-amazing!). Room service is offered from here, and I can only assume the experience will be as nice. There is a small coffee shop with morning bakery, and that was a delight first thing in the morning. The morning paper was at the door, and although the offerings included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I opted for the local paper. In-room wireless internet was complimentary, and signal strength in the room was fine. The location is simply wonderful, literally across the street from Post Alley and well-known pub Kell's, and (in my opinion) a better, local favorite White Horse Pub - DO stop in and give this gem a try! As you can see from the pictures, the Public Market is at your doorstep, and the rooftop terrace has a spectacular view (lacking in most of the rooms). I wish I had a full day to appreciate the rooftop deck, because it was delightful first thing in the morning (again, I refer to the pictures). The energy in the area is wonderful, and you are walking distance to much that Seattle offers. Again, the Market, the hill climb, the Aquarium, Ivar's (a must for Seattle), are all a few minutes of downhill stroll (long enough to enjoy a latte on the way!) All in all, The Inn at the Market is all about location, with a nice boutique feel. You can find something more comfortable, lower cost, better appointed, better restaurant, etc etc... but it is unlikely that you can find ALL these in one hotel for the price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6538904">My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The location is great - so close to all the shopping areas and literally next door to Pike's Market. Lots of great restaurants in the area and the staff is very helpful at recommending them. Our room overlooked the street below but wasn't noisy at all. There is plenty of space in the rooms for luggage and the bathroom is big and bright. Excellent mattress as well. We can't wait to go back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6477252">We spent a long time researching hotels in downtown Seattle for our 25th wedding anniversary. We are so glad/thankful we selected The Inn At The Market! It was perfect. We had a beautiful room overlooking Puget Sound. (Deluxe water view-8th floor) We watched the ferries and boats go by our window. The hotel was extremely quiet - it was like we were the only guests. We were treated kindly. On our arrival they set out a card and special chocolates for our anniversary. I can't say enough - I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very special place to stay. We plan to make this a yearly event - we had the best time!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5974284">A lovely hotel in a great location. The room was a good size and not too noisy even though it was on the town side. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace with a glass of wine. Just one point make sure that you check out in person. We did an express check out and then when we got our credit card bill found that they had charged us even though we had prepaid through Expedia. This was promptly sorted out but was inconvenient<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5962326">My wife and myself recently spent 5 nights at the Inn at the Market while I attended a convention. We had a very nice time at this small, comfortably furnished hotel that has a great location just up the hill from Pike Place Market. The walk to the convention center is about 8 blocks east, pretty easy except for the steep 1/2 block adjacent to the hotel. There are a number of trendy restaurants as you walk north on First Ave. and Pioneer Square with its old stone buildings and charming pergola is south along the same road. And of course, the market is a 1/2 block to the west and has many food stands, boutiques, fish and flower stalls, handicrafts, jewelry tables, entertainers, and ethnic dining options that spill onto the narrow alleys and covered arcades. It was a pleasure to wake up in the morning and grab something to eat nearby while watching the small trucks and vans unload their wares and the vendors set up their tables. Our room was on the corner overlooking the city and was very spacious, with lots of storage space in the wardrobe and a large bathroom. The sink was a pedestal-type, so spreading out toiletries was limited to the glass shelf or nearby small table/shelf unit. We could hear traffic noise from the street, which was annoying, but we did request their lowest-priced room and it is in the city, so I wasn't expecting total silence when we closed the doors. The rooms have window seats with pillows, a nice feature that makes the rooms appear bigger and provides additional seating or a good spot for reading while people-watching. The decor is contemporary, with beiges, browns, and blacks predominating. In good weather, the upstairs terrace would be a nice place to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and the market. The modern, brick building surrounds a pleasant courtyard with a splashing fountain/sculpture adjacent to some outdoor seating for the hotel restaurant. The lobby opens off the courtyard and has a fireplace, stuffed chairs, and the registration desk, where the helpful staff operates. We enjoyed our time here. The hotel is a nice option for those who don't want a large convention hotel in a central Seattle location. Do be aware that Seattle does have its share of street people and that there are a couple of strip clubs near the front of Pike Place Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5899461">Unfortunately we never got to stay at the Inn at the Market. After flying from Montreal all day we arrived tired, only to be told that they were overbooked and we had to go elsewhere for our overnight stop in Seattle. The front desk told us they had arranged a room at the Alexis Hotel and the cost would be charged back to them, and they even paid our cab fare to get there. We were also told we could have a free night at the Inn at the Market next time we were in town. That's REAL customer service!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5876916">After much researching of hotel properties for our four-night stay in Seattle after a cruise to Alaska, I chose the IATM. It couldn't have been more perfect for our stay. It was "right AT the market", close to all restaurants, shops, coffee shops etc. The room was quite small but staff accomodated our request for a high floor (8th). Clean and well maintained and the personnel were efficient and very polite. Repaired a "running toilet" within a very short time, after complaint. Deck on 5th floor overlooking Elliott Bay is a plus, to be outdoors and relaxing with a view in a large city is a nice touch. My concern was coming from sunny Florida, I planned for four rainy days in Seattle and wanted to be within proximity to everything, which we were. Were very lucky with sunshine most of the time. Hotel was great. Would be our choice next time!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5816494">The Inn at the Market was great hotel with the entrance tucked in an alley way. Beautiful rooms were large with a view of the harbor. We were right next door to Pike Market and a block from the waterfront where we took the Lock Cruise. Great cruise! Several restaurants and shops are near the hotel. We walked everywhere. I didn't realize there were so many hills in Seattle. The walk to Pioneer Square was only five blocks, but the homeless and decay in that area was a drawback. The Underground Tour was worth the walk! We caught a bus back to the hotel since they were free in the downtown area. We had to use valet parking for our car at $25 a night. Parking was too hard to find in that area. I thought that the rooms were overpriced too, but I guess hotels can overcharge in August.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5813468">We've stayed here many times over the past 5 years and have always had a great experience, but this trip showed the hotel is losing it's high rating. Their attention to detail (lack of maintenance) is showing. Carpets dirty, a disgusting strong perfume stench used by housekeeping to try and cover odors in the hallways. Smoking allowed in a non-smoking hotel. Many little details are being over looked. The location and view are still the best for hotels in this area but the room and maintenance are average at best. We will try other hotels over this one in the future - at 355.00 a night I was very disappointed!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5617130">We just returned from a week in Seattle and chose the Inn at the Market and are very happy we did. We had a water view room and we were on the top floor. The views of Elliott Bay were breathtaking. From our room we could watch the market wake up every morning, the ferry crossings and the cruise ships. The inn is beautifully furnished, well appointed and the staff was very friendly. We did not rent a car for the trip, but wanted a car for one day to go to Mount Rainier. Just asked at teh front desk and the car was delivered right to the inn for us and picked up when we were back from our day trip. You are in walking distance to Pioneer Square, downtown shopping, the market, the piers for any water trips and lots of great restaurants. The inn has three restaurants as well. There is a rooftop garden with chairs for relaxing with your morning coffee or an afternoon glass of wine. We felt the inn to be the perfect choice for us and would definitely stay there again the ext time we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5464558">Everything about this hotel is perfect. We stayed in a townhouse suite for two nights and wish we could have stayed a month. As soon as we walked in our room and opened the windows, we could see that we had a million dollar view! We could see both the skyline of the city as well as Pike's market (it's literally about 50 feet away), the water, and the mountains in the distance. The room was two levels with a kitchenette and living room downstairs and bedroom and bathroom upstairs. The bose radio was great - in fact we never even turned on the television! The beds were really comfortable, and the linens were top-notch. Okay, now on to the service: in one word, fantastic. It's extremely important to me to be greeted with a casual and genuine manner every time I enter or leave a hotel, with eye-contact.... sounds easy, but it's a rarity in today's hotel market. No matter when we came or went, we were always greeted with a smile and eye contact - I really love that. The staff was more than helpful and always went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that we were well taken care of, that we knew about the great places to see and wonderful restaurants to dine at. Some hotels just don't get it, but Inn at the Market definitely understands that excellent service is what hospitality is all about. I'd much rather stay at a small, intimate property like this where I'm taken care of than in some monstrous hotel. Kudos to the staff and management for making this a fabulous hotel experience!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124392872">Don't do what I did....stay here with my family because it was the best price I could find. At 2am, with other occupants of the hotel screaming, drunk and in a terrible fight, I would have paid the $50 more, or $100, to NOT have been there. We got little sleep and had to call front desk to come and handle the people fighting right outside our door. I didn't really care that much that the room was run down and dirty. It was exposing my kids to what felt like a truly unsafe situation that caused my regret. This hotel is definitely the home to drug deals, prostitution, and all night hollering and brawls. I've never written a review before but I feel strongly about trying to help you avoid what we went through. When we checked in, there was a very unhappy looking couple checking out. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never checked in. Just suck it up and stay at the Paramount. You'll be glad you did.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR123998148">Sorry not even reasonable for the price. Some homeless people in the region had more comfortable accomodations. July 4 weekend it was 109/night, we were desperate because most places sold out. Window was busted up and didn't close, fine for the temprature, realy bad for the nose, exhaust of cars out front and the constant fear of gun point robbery. The front desk staff and manager was AWFUL. Lied to us about rooms on phone, watched him lie to potential customers coming in.

<comment category="negative" id="UR120240874">ARG! How this overall ranked as 3 stars is completely beyond me. As I was checking in, rats were climbing all over the counter squeaking for a refund. Ok, no real rats. Nor bugs that I noticed, but for the love of Seattle, this place was a DUMP. Where to beginâ€¦ the street level parking is awful. The underground was horrible as well. The room was the size of 3 closets put together. The one elevator with buttons from 1912 was scary. The staff was incredibly unhelpful. There was no breakfast. The bathroomâ€¦oh GODâ€¦ the bathroom was small, old, disgusting, dirty and full of hair and rust - no joke! There was no Kleenex in the place. The bed was hard and scary. Thank goodness there were three locks on the doors because the place didnâ€™t seem secure. Now, itâ€™s in a great neighborhood, and the views were very good of both downtown and the space needle. Itâ€™s on the Monorail, but be prepared to walk Â½ mile one way or another to board it. It has a â€œreasonableâ€� price. Butâ€¦what I had to experience there, was not worth $10. The ONE-WAY ramp into the underground parking was so narrow, Iâ€™m surprised a scooter could make it. And even then, youâ€™ll have to back up, move forward, back up a few times to get into a spot. Again, I liked the neighborhood and area, and the price was okay, but dear Lord, I worried about all the contents of my car the entire stay I had there â€“ I was moving to Seattle and had all my belongings in my vehicle. And equally, I could NOT stand the disgusting bathroom or the â€œfree Wi-Fiâ€� that only worked one of my two nights there. The only reason I didnâ€™t move out after 1 night, was because the price only matched hotels 20 miles away from downtown and thatâ€™s where I needed to stay. Please, PLEASE, do not stay here. If you care about your belongings, your sanity, your security, your cleanliness or your well being, you will avoid this place like the plague it is.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118566910">If I was bringing a hooker back to some seedy hotel, this is where I would go. The rooms are about 12'x12' and the bed squeaks every time you move. No water glasses, tin tiny soap bars, and a broken smoke detector, add to the ambience of this fine establishment. The bathroom is about the size of a closet. We found a smoked cigarette butt floating in the toilet, in our non-smoking room. Shows exactly how much the owners care about cleanliness. I ended up paying for parking, since the underground parking lot was full. This feat of manueverig only took 20 minutes of my time, since the idiot at the front desk obviously did not keep track of anything. The tv in the room got all 4 basic cable channels, so I guess thats a plus. Only stayed here because all other hotels were booked. How the owners get away with changing $100 is beyond me! The best part of staying here was getting out of the room. Avoid this dump at all costs, unless you have some kinky hooker fantasy going on, or want to experience how people in communist Europe used to live.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117907611">This motel is a motel, it served our needs, and I've stayed at worse places. We stayed for three nights in room 210 in early September. We had requested a room with two beds, and were pleasantly surprised that the two bedrooms were separated by a door. The hotel is nothing fancy. The bathroom, carpet, and sheets were clean. No bed bugs or other creepers. I read the reviews after my friend booked the place and every other place was twice as pricey or filled up, and was a little nervous. I prepared by buying earplugs and remembering to make sure that the door was locked every time we left. I ended up not having to use the earplugs, even though there was construction outside the back window. My worst fears weren't realized, and we both slept fine. It's perhaps not as quiet as the Westin next door, but it wasn't a problem. No parties kept us up, and nothing bad happened. The front desk kindly loaned us an iron and ironing board, and let us keep it in the room for our stay. He was also helpful with restaurant recommendations and getting a layout of the city. The location is great. Maybe other rooms are worse, or other people had different experiences. But the negative reviews seem overblown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115520443">My boyfriend and I wandered in here late one night and managed to book a corner room on the 3rd floor for $60. The King's Inn is one of the only downtown hotels where I haven't been required to put a credit card on file. The pleasant fellow at the front desk did take a cash deposit for the old school metal room key he provided us. I asked about amenities and he mentioned a TV in each room. When I got to my windowless corner room I was appalled. The room was dingy, dirty and below the standard of all but the most flexible of travelers. The bed made us cringe, the door kept opening by itself and the portable space heater kept buzzing. The bathroom was very similar to the ones in an airplanes in size and the water pressure was awful. The linens were of the lowest imaginable thread count. It's really too bad, the place could be really cool if the owners spent a bit of money on it. Originally the Town Centre Motel, the hotel was considered the best located in the city in the 60s and features a cool mid century motor inn design. The location is pretty great... right under the monorail, close to the downtown/ retail core, Belltown and the Seattle Center. Unless you are stranded in downtown Seattle with no credit card I would not recommend staying here!<topic>none</topic>

We had a great time in the city until we returned to the hotel to find all of our stuff had been stolen. We immediately called the police and notified the front desk. The hotel did not even give us a free night at the hotel. Nor do they seem to care that if we were in the room we could have potentially been hurt or maybe killed. When we spoke with the "manager" he could not even provide us with the owners name. This place is extremely sketchy. I Would not recommend anyone to stay here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR99424591">Unbelievable! This is a great place to stay if your into drug trafficing, prostitution, and hanging out with people who are high on who knows what!!!??? My girlfriends and I came to stay for the weekend and were mislead by the online ad for this Motel (which was advertised as a Hotel). As soon as we pulled in people on the lower levels shut out their lights and started peaking through the cracks of their curtains... Too high to realize that we could see them! We unloaded our things onto an elevator and were surrounded by about 5 men covered in pock and track marks! We witness two GI's (who happened to check in when we did) go to their rooms with two (i'm not kidding!) noticible transvestite prostitutes. We finally made it up to our room and realized that the door didn't lock! The front desk gave us a hard time about switching up to a room that did lock. We were on the 3rd level and as we looked down into the parking lot people were wondering from room to room. One room in particular had people roaming in and out, while friends waited in the parking lot. We had people knock on our room door asking us if we had a cigarette, matches, a lighter? We decited to leave to go get a drink (we had to be atleast a little tipsy to fall asleep in this hell hole!!!) We went to pull out and realized we were totally locked in! Not a security gate where we could use our room key to enter or exit... But seriously... a full on gate that was padlocked shut. The manager had to come out and unlock, open and lock it back up. We asked why we were locked in like that and they said to protect us from the people out there! We couldn't help but ask... What about the people in here????!!!!! This is the 1000% truth about our experience at this hotel. We only stayed one night and I am surprised we survived!!! (ha ha ha... we did hear one gang member looking guy mention that we looked like cops... We went with that!) The only good thing about this hotel was the free parking!!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR87985569">yes, this place is basic, with aged furniture and bathroom... but my experience was by far not as bad as described in many other reviews. The room was cleant every day, TV worked, the bed was okay and I didn't have to share it with any bugs. Well, the doors indeed do not appear as secure but it's not good practice in any hotel to leave your valuables outside of a safe. If you're only at the motel for sleeping, it surely is sufficient - the location is excellent and there were no loud noises during my 1-week stay there. I guess it all also comes down to what people are accustomed to, but what do you expect from a 80$ per night motel right in the city centre? If people have stayed at the Marriot Seaside before (which one of the reviewers had), then of course it will be a disappointment to change to the Kings Inn. In summary, if you're looking for comfort and luxury, of course don't go here - in case you're looking for a cheap place right in the city, it's fine. And in case you need to escape, there is a great donut place right next door :-)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR77229438">I was in a rush to find a reasonably priced room in downtown Seattle, of course, at the last minute. I found this one and booked it four nights without researching it. Out of curiosity, I looked at the reviews. I got into a panic! I changed my reservation to two nights because I did not want to lose money, but I was scared. I checked in with great trepidation. The office is totally ugly, like the elevator and stairs. But the attendant was cordial. Yeap, the elevator is filthy, so the stairs which stink even when they are open to the outside. I did not run into any questionable, drunk or frightening characters. Guests I came across were the typical tourist (some with family) who stay in very low budget motels and perhaps know what to expect. Thus, all rooms open to a corridor, and if you do not close the curtains, everyone will look into your room. Nothing new about that on motels. My room had been remodeled very recently: new carpet, painted, new bed. The bathroom had new linoleum, new sink, painted, new mirror. Good soap, shampoo and conditioner provided, but no cups. The door lock and dealt bolt worked fine. The room was designed for a single bed, but a queen bed was provided instead. This made the room very tight on space. So tight, there was only about 2 feet open space around the bed. But there were no bed bugs, the covers were warm, and the bed most comfortable. The place was quiet at night. I should say that I did not go out after dark to explore the place in the dark, my typical approach when I visit a new city for the first time. I let others do that and report. The wi-fi worked well all the time, on my Mac and iPod. I would had stayed the extra two days, since I felt comfortable at this place, but I had made reservations elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR72475167">I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The hotel has a great location within walking distance to everything. The outside is pretty old and rundown looking but they have free parking. We were lucky enough to get room 109 which is the only one in this hotel that has a kitchen in it. The rooms are 1980's and could really use a redo. The bathroom had no plugs so I had to do my hair in the kitchen. The hotel is right on an alley so it is loud if you sleep with the windows opened. I felt safe and if you get over the place being a little older you will enjoy your stay. Wasn't bad and wasn't great. The rooms are really small and we actually got some giggles on how run down the place was. If you are looking for a cheap place and want what you pay for this is it. I read reviews before going and we didn't run into any drug dealers, prostitutes, or fleas so that was good.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR70355206">We stayed in the Kings Inn Seattle for two nights in May 2010. The price was reasonable and although small, the room was reasonably comfortable. It is a budget motel with the furnishings and bathroom reflecting this. We were out most of the time so it did not bother us too much. Our room was on the very top floor in the corner and did not appear to be very secure but we had no problems. The reception staff were not very friendly or helpful and the lift was disgusting with filthy carpet inside it. The room itself was clean enough but it is definitely not the kind of accommodation you want to spend the day in. Great location though - we could walk to Pike St Market and around most of the downtown area, and they have on site parking at no charge which is great.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR60840400">My two sisters, brother in law, and I stayed at this motel as a last resort. We arrived in Seattle on a Saturday afternoon and to our dismay, every single hotel in the downtown area was booked solid. We drove around for hours searching for somewhere to stay the night. At our last stop, Best Western, we were informed that there were no rooms available. The gentleman at the counter then suggested that we try the Kings Inn. It was already midnight by the time we arrived at the Kings Inn. I had my sister go and see if a room was available. She returned a couple of minutes later and told me that the Korean guy who ran the place had assured her that the rooms were very clean. She then made the colossal mistake of booking a room for the nightâ€¦â€¦ The nightmare began when I was cautiously approaching the room. Several â€œgangstersâ€� and prostitutes approached me and asked me if I wanted to go to a party in their room. They looked like they had been on a weeklong booze and drug binge! When I kindly told them no, they began calling me obscene names and flipping me off! Terrified, my family and I ran into the room and tried to close the door, only to discover that it would not shut properly and had no lock on it! We then began to examine the room and our hearts sank in unison. It was an absolute pigsty! It reeked to high heaven and strange formations of mold appeared to be growing on the ceiling. The beds were shoddy and dirty. The mattresses were sunken in the middle and there were bloodstains on the sheets. They smelled like an outhouse! We were horrified! We decided as a group to get a refund and to try to find a hotel outside of Seattle. When we asked the Korean man for a refund he rudely told us that too much time had passed and he was not going to give us our money back. He told us that the best he could do was to give us a new room. We had spent the last of our money on the room and the car was too small to sleep in, so we were forced to stay in that hell hole! When we arrived at the new room, the only thing that had changed was that the door actually had a lock on it. When I inspected the bathroom, I almost retched! The floor, tub, toilet, and sink had suspicious brown stains all over them and the mirror was broken. Later that night when I took off my shoes, I was disgusted when my feet began sticking to the carpet. The further I walked the stickier my feet became! When I sat down and looked at the bottom of my feet, they were completely covered in a revolting black substance! I decided to sleep with all my clothes on that night. It was around 2 am when someone began screaming outside of our room and began pounding on our door! They sounded like they were being murdered! We could hear loud rap music blasting throughout the night and people partying until 5 am! We all spent a sleepless night, too frozen in terror to sleep! The next morning I was itching furiously and had flea bites all over my arms! Needless to say, this hotel is not fit for even animals to inhabit! It should be shut down as soon as possible!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR52739062">We wanted to stay close to the city, that is why we had chosen this hotel. The location was really good, but the rest really was not. We are not so demanding guests, but what we have experienced here, was really a bad dream. The hotel seemed nice from outside, but then everything relieved. Dirty bathroom, no breakfast (only coffee and tea!), dirty room. What was the worst - we have realized next day in the morning- there was some flea in the bed, so we had more than 40 stings all over our bodies! If you have to stay in Seattle, please look for a better hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR46049252">My daughter and her father as well as her grandmother and some friends stayed at the King's Inn for one night before departing on a cruise to Alaska. She told me that when they drove up to it, she thought they were stopping to look at the map and then would be on their way to their actual hotel. She called me and told me that she was staying in "a hole," and at first I ddin't beleive her. But when she told me all of the things she was experiencing: sticky carpets, slow wi-fi, smelly beds, loud traffic outside the window, "creepy" men staring at her and her friends from the third story balcony, outdated bathrooms and many other inconveniences, I agreed that she was staying in a hole. I checked on trip advisor and read the horrid reviews that other people had written. They were staying another night in Seattle, but she and many members of the group felt that it was unacceptable (and that's being nice about it) to stay here. The clerk at the desk the afternoon they arrived was very nice and did not give them any trouble. But the man in the morning was rude. One of the girls on the trip accidentally left a charger to her camera plugged into the wall and when they went back to the King's Inn to ask if anyone had seen it and brought it to the front desk, the clerk (the one who was rude earlier that day) said that he didn't know anything about it and that the maids would have been the ones to have it. But he didn't have a key to the maid's closet and couldn't get ahold of them on the phone to ask. They went back at the appropriate time that the maids were supposed to be there, but they found out that the clerk had told them wrong and that the maids came in the mornings. This place may have been cheap, but she said that she did not feel safe (because sometimes the doors did not lock), and she would have paid some of her own money (that was meant for shopping on the cruise) to stay somewhere else. The rooms could have been dirtier, I suppose, but my daughter told me that the sheets were scratchy and stained and the comforter smelled like something very unpleasant. She was able to joke about how utterly disgusting it was, and it was certainly something that she will never forget.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR45706750">We arrived from a long, arduous overseas flight with our 12 month-old baby and checked into the Kings Inn at around 10pm. Juggling bags, baby and a pram we made our way up the stairs. The rooms were small (no problem) and clean, but perhaps a little TOO clean - the carpets were extremely sticky and smelt overpoweringly of chemicals. Asked for a spoon to feed bub - no, we don't have any spoons. OK then. Continued struggling up and down the stairs over the next three days with a pram, even had the help of the front-desk attendant one day. You can imagine my surprise when on the last day I noticed an elevator one of the corners of the hotel... Unhelpful staff, yes, but the location was great and the streets were nice and quiet. I'd only stay here again if I were absolutely desperate (and single). The price should have been some type of warning...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR42236664">Because of a change in plans, we were unable to stay our last night at Westen, a couple blocks away. Also unable to get a room on short notice at any other hotel downtown. If we had a car, we would have slept in it. Set a wake-up call with the clerk when we checked in and discovered when we got to the room, there was no phone. He gave me a spare from under his counter, but we didn't need it anyway because the wake-up never came and we never slept for more than an hour at a time anyway because of the noise and concern about an open window on the ground floor in the area the place was situated. Air conditioner didn't work--were told by clerk it worked like all the others and if we were not not satisified, open the window. One bulb in three-bulb bath fixture. Stay away.

These rooms were completely disgusting.....The staff was rude, crude and sociablly unexceptable......I would not recommend this hell to a gitmo bay prisoner.....

<comment category="negative" id="UR20455094">There were several problems with this motel. let me first tell you about the pluses: it was very conveniently located. It is inexpensive for the location. Now the minuses: poor upkeep, everything looked used, dented, broken, smudged, or dirty. The room was very small, so small that one of ran into the table every time he got up in the night. And worst of all, the carpeting was sticky. When I was getting ready to leave I looked at the soles of my feet, they were black!

Went to a friends room at the Weston tried to find another room in the city couldn't was going to sleep on the floor in our friends room. Called Kings Inn tried to get our money back after half hour and wouldn't give a refund. Called AAA which recommend then place on a whim since everything else was sold out in town.

<comment category="negative" id="UR16224641">Seattle PD, where were you on the night of my stay? My vehicle broke down in the downtown area early January on my way back to Vancouver. The Kings seemed like a life saver at the time, as it was 11:30 Pm on a wednesday night. The rate, (about $90) although pricey, was still cheaper then a tow truck. Upon checking in, I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman of dark complexion who kindly showed me to my room and assisted me in finding a quality pizza service. It seemed that all would be well as I retired to my room to grab some some sleep. I believe I was afforded an hour of sleep before the Nightmare started. Sometime around 2:00 AM the screaming, door slamming and other intense activities began. It wasnt untill I went outside for a cigarette that I realized how badly law enforcment was needed. I was first approached on the balcony by an african fellow who wondered if I had " that Creme" for him. This was only the first of many attempts to lure me into a room by many of the motels occupants. There was obvious drug use of the Crack Cocaine variety present as well as prostitution , violence and drug trafficing from room to room. I believe i had been mistaken as someone else because all night there were phone calls being routed to my room and people banging on my door asking if " I had It" for them. What happend to decency and safe clean nights sleep? I'll be sure to steer clear off the downtown area from now on. Seattle is so wonderful during the day, but don't ever let yourself be caught there at night. Dont let the Kings Inn fool you, it seems alright, but unless you feel like gambling with your morality and your decency stay as far away as you can from this Dark Dirty Drug Den.<topic>none</topic>

Only stayed there because Holiday Inn screwed up our reservation and this was the only place in the area that had a vacancy. Upon arrival the room nex door was being fumagated by guys in white coveralls and respirators, spraying chemicals (probably to kill the cockroaches or to clean up after someone got snuffed the night before).

<comment category="negative" id="UR10079042">I planned to stay here out of desparation, as my original plans changed. I had no luck getting lodging nearby for the night and had a reservation here the following night. I decided to try this place. At 9:30 am, I was told I could check in now if I liked. My baggage was at the hotel I had stayed the night before. I was charged up front for two nights before even going to the room! I headed back to where I stayed the night before and checked on one more place (a nice major chain) they had a room for only $30 more. I returned to this place and told my change of plans. I was told I would not get a refund for the night as I had already checked in and it had been more than 30 mins. My reasons were: very small room, very outdated and worn furnishings, overwhelming smell of cleaning solution and portable space heaters! They would not listen and insisted I had checked in (I guess according to there computers). The offered me another room. When I went to that one, there was plaster chipping and falling off the wall at baseboard level. I decided it was not in my best interest to stay and they refunded the next night, which was $20 chaeper than the current night. The time lapsed from my charge and credit was 37mins/40 secs. I most likely spent 7 mins or so trying to get a refund and checking out the other disgusting room. The condition of this place should warrant $50 rooms. There are numerous affordable (some even cheaper)rooms nearby but they were not available. I guess this would explain why there were so many "Ready" rooms at 9:30 on a Saturday morning. Never pay up front and price is not everything!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5790283">The Kings Inn is a decent stay for people on a budget. It's cheap compared to other accomodations in downtown Seattle, and so long as you aren't expecting anything other than the bare necessities, I don't think you will be too disappointing. The room itself was small and sparce, but it was clean. It wasn't very noisy at all. When it comes to the shower, don't even mess around with the cold water, as I turned the hot water handle a full 360 degrees, the water was still, at best, tepid. Other than that, no real complaints. The other reviews make this place sound like a hole, but it's really not all that bad, albeit, I never had any problems with the hotel manager. For anyone on a budget, this place isn't too bad.

<comment category="negative" id="UR5561951">Save yourself a hassel and do not stay at this place. We asked if we could view a room before making a decision. The Asian man behind the counter told us we could but we needed to give him a credit card to hold while we did. We came back disqusted and said we were surely not going to stay there. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The outdoor elevator didn't seem as though it had the power to make it to the third floor (probably because there were a few hundred cigarettes on the floor of the elveator). The paint on the walls of the room was coming off in more than a few places. Over the phone they told us that parking was free. When we arrived they told us it was 15 dollars a night to park at the hotel. They advertised the room as a suite. Really, it had a bed, tiny bathroom, and a small beat up microwave was on the floor. When we arrived back at the counter to ask for our card back, he told us he thought we intended on staying and he said he already ran the credit card for a full weeks stay. We were furious and demanded he reverse the charges. He told us it was too late and that our conversation was upsetting possilbe customers so he called the police. When the police arrived, they were confused at why he was charging us. The asked him when it could be reversed and he said in the morning. The best thing he did all night was call the police on us because the police ended up being on our side completely. We still ended up being charged 5 percent of a weeks stay. ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS LOOK INSIDE A ROOM BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF SLEEPING IN A DUMPSTER THAN PAYING TO DEAL WITH THE PLACE. I WISH I HAD READ THIS BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE. We ended up staying a couple blocks away at Summersfiled suites. I highly recommend Summerfields suites.

The manager was totally stressed out as a slum lord is and because of his stressed state he makes it hard to get to your room because he is having to weed out the crime.

<comment category="negative" id="UR4467061">I stayed here with three other friends in the summer. Let me first say that this is a budget hotel, so don't expect anything better than average. If it's comfort, convenience, etc. you want, you won't get it here. If, however, you're looking for a place to cover your head for the night, this isn't that bad of an option. We checked-in fairly quickly and took the stairs up to our room. We had two double beds and like any other budget hotel, you're first impression is "it's been used and abused." The good thing was that I didn't get that slimy feeling. The beds were okay, the pillows were skimpy, and the comforter was pilled. The washroom was okay. We had a courtyard view that provided an up-close view of the Needle. There is a decent size swimming pool indoors and a jacuzzi. I didn't use either but my buddies did try both. The jacuzzi kinda looked a little filthy to me but you can certainly smell the chlorine in the room, so maybe that'll ease your chill. The area is quiet and away from the city center (about a 30 minute walk). There are other budget hotels around the neighborhood. Next door is one of those local diners that serve excellent comfort food. We had breakfast there for a couple mornings and the wait staff were very friendly. Other than that, there isn't much around.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4124820">I was in Seattle for five days for a convention in Nov 05. Booked this hotel, very near the convention site and very convenient to downtown Seattle for about a third of what the "convention rate" rooms were going for. After I booked the hotel, I read some of the reviews here and began to question my choice. True: my room was small - bed, TV, table, chair, two lamps, dresser, and bathroom (no alarm clock, fridge, or microwave) - but I was warm at night (despite the not-so-great heater), had hot water, reliable wake-up calls, and the room was clean. False: excessive noise, peeling paint, unfriendly staff. Realistic expectations are important: if you want a place with a great location on a limited budget, stay at King's Inn. If you want all the ammenities, the company of more "sofisticated" hotel guests, continental breakfast... - pay a little more for your comfort and peace of mind.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4105694">It is a dump, of course, but not as horrible as some of the other reviews will make you believe. And the location IS great. This hotel is old, and some things (paint in the rooms, bathroom fittings, a coat of paint on the outside) could stand an upgrade. But the sheets are clean and changed daily. The noise that other people were talking about did not materilize beyond the normal street noise of a big city downtown. The one thing that I noticed, is that it is fairly cold in the room at night (my stay was in November) and the air conditioners that serve as heaters are pretty noisy but bearable.<topic>none</topic>

The matress was old and sagging EVERYWHERE, the carpet was dirty, the paint on the walls peeling. The bath tub was mildewy, and rust stained, the light fixture was wired in with the wire running up the wall across the cieling, and over to the fixture. The light fixture was held together with Masking tape. The mirror in the bathroom was broken on the edges in several places, leaving sharp edges easy to cut yourself on. The tv was plugged in using a long, thin extension cord over to the other wall. They lock the gates at 11pm so you can't get your car out of the garage, and you have to buzz to get onto the property to get to your room.

<comment category="negative" id="UR3299262">We were doing multi-city traveling so decided to make sleeping arrangements lowest priority. This definitely was low. Southwest Airlines recommended this motel and we made reservations for 3 nights. We drove in late from Vancouver (1:30 a.m.) and boy were we surprised. There is a sliding barrier gate that is locked after a certain hour to keep out non-guests. They needed it as two guys off the very noisy entrance street tried to get in "to visit a friend" when we checked in. When they were made to leave they were shouting discrimination because we were getting in. People were wandering around the hotel all night making lots of noise. The room was musty and needed renovation. Remote control missing from it's anchored spot on the nightstand. At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out. Sleeping arrangements have made a huge leap in our priorities. We lost half a day of seeing Seattle by sleeping the next day out of exhaustion. Comfort, quiet and security were only $40 more across the street.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3297289">We picked up a coupon book from a rest stop and discovered that all the motels we tried had reason not take them, including this one. So we paid a whopping $80.00 u.s. to stay in this god forsaken place. It smelled bad, the T.V. barely worked, the wallpaper was falling off the wall and patched elsewhere, the mattress was old and sagging (very sore backs in the morning), the toilet wouldn't flush unless we played with the handle for a while and the in wall heater under the window was broken so we had a floor heater sitting on the floor in this already very tiny room. A few doors down from us was a group of young men who were there explicitly for partying. They were yelling, running back and forth (by our room), thowing plastic ice buckets and hanging off the banisters, on and off, throughout the night. I did not sleep. Being from Victoria we started our trip at 4 a.m. so we were very tired and ended up here because we had tried so many places and just got tired of looking. We visit Seattle several times a year and have for tweny-five, but we decided on that night that Seattle just isn't worth it anymore. I cringe to think what $80.00 u.s. would get me in Victoria.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2476975">My fiance and I stayed there while sight-seeing in downtown Seattle for a few days vacation. Rate was about $60 a night which isn't too bad considering the location near downtown where average prices are twice as much. One good thing is that there is some parking available at the motel unlike some other motels in the area. The room was small but adequete and had a musty/cigarette smell but otherwise was clean. Bathroom was small but clean and complimentary soap and towels as well as a shower. As with some other reviews, it is a bit noisy with the traffic and el-train going by but was tolerable since we were close to many of the downtown things we were wanting to go to. If you are looking for a decent deal but not expecting the Hilton--for around sixty bucks it wasn't too bad.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125626671">Drove down to Seattle from Vancouver for my wife's birthday and she's been dying to stay at an Ace Hotel. We weren't disappointed! It's just like others have described it...a hostel for Adults. People were walking around in pyjamas at night/early morning and it just had a very cozy cool vibe. It's not your typical hotel so if you aren't flexible and open to new things you'll have a bad experience. Don't go! The continental breakfast was simple but fun. Fresh waffles, good Stumptown coffee, and clean. We were upgraded to room with its own washroom at no extra charge because I mentioned it was my wife's birthday. They also included a nice birthday greeting in our room. To everyone at Ace: keep on doing what you're doing! To those who are intrigued: give it a whirl!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125124932">Excellent things can grow from excellent ideas. Though it doesn't always succeed or grow on a smooth path, it is awesome to watch a concept transform and breed new iterations of the original. That's how I would frame the Ace Hotel phenomena that's swept from west to east. I'm very familiar with the New York offspring of this Seattle original. Very cool, celeb chef in their restaurant, lounge for a lobby and some serious partners names partnered up: Stumptown Coffee in the front, Opening Ceremony in the back and more I'm sure to come. All that swagger grew out of an original hotel in Seattle. One which still offers excellent pricing for both European-style rooms (ahem, bathroom outside of the room) and Deluxe suites ($199 and worth every penny). The staff is friendly and accommodating; though please remember that the front door locks at midnight so grab that key before hitting the town! The modern design and simple but ultra cool decor feels opulent in comparison to your run of the mill big box hotels. WiFi is free to use and besides your room, you can choose to work in the front shared area with the terrarium or event downstairs in the dining area. Oh yea, in addition to WiFi and super sweet rooms, they offer a continental breakfast that includes a waffle maker and Stumptown Coffee. And a copy of the New York Times. Location-wise, it's just outside of the touristy area so Pike Place Market is only a 15 minute stroll away and the streets are very walkable. In my opinion, there's no better place to stay in Seattle for that price! Don't mess with an original.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122896903">This is the PERFECT hotel: sweet quiet clean and charming, uber-hip but gentle and just down-to-the-bone nice (and located close to everything). I can't recall the last time I was this happy in a hotel. My room was really inexpensive because the bathrooms were down the hall, but the bathrooms were hospital clean and bright and large and the soaps and shampoos were really nice--and the little sink in my room (European style) was all I needed. I liked being there so much! Great desk staff, excellent spa downstairs, nice breakfast...I'll never stay anywhere else in Seattle: Ace is the place!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115930884">We were so looking forward to staying here. We'd heard so much about the Ace Hotels. The room rate was more than Hotel Moneco and I felt like I was a backpacker. The room was tiny, the person at the front desk couldn't recommend a good bar and there was no place to park our car. I appreciate the concept but it really wasn't valuable either through financial benefit or "funkiness". Wouldn't stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115232722">We stayed two nights at the Ace Hotel in a double room with a shared bathroom. The hotel itself is really good, trendy interior and felt well maintained and clean. After advice from a friend who said the rooms at the front were really noisy from the bar downstairs, at booking I specifically requested rooms at the back. So I was disappointed to arrive and find we were just a couple of rooms back, at the side, still above the bar. The music from the bar did disturb our sleep the first night, but after finding the the earplugs supplied in the room for the second night, it wasn't as much of an issue. The bar closed at 2am and after that it was fairly quiet. I would still recommend this hotel, as the rooms are comfortable with nice touches (bathrobe, brita water filter), and the shared bathrooms were numerous and kept clean. The included breakfast is also worth having (the self serve waffles are good fun).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114870661">We stayed at the Ace Hotel for the last leg of our Pacific Northwest trip, and seriously considered extending our flight just to we could stay another night. If only there were more hotels like this.... okay, maybe hotel isn't the right word for it. Adult Playground Hostel might be more like it. Ace Hotel is in a perfect location, on a quiet strip of 1st avenue but less than a 10 minute walk from the Pike Place Market and downtown. The rooms look like they are out of a CB2 catalog, and despite the tight fit, they are actually decorated quite nicely &amp; with a trendy flair. There is breakfast served every day until NOON (awesome), and the employees are very friendly. Don't be discouraged by the shared bathrooms and showers. Although a 1 second walk outside of your room is required, the bathrooms are still very private and, if anything, cleaner than many of the real hotels I've stayed at. Long story short, stay here. You won't regret it -- and neither will your wallet.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR113562518">We spent the weekend at ACE and it was a positive stay overall but go in with your eyes open because it wont be to everyone's taste. The older building is renovated and has a friendly staff with a great location close to all the major attractions. Rooms are small and clean, Our room had a large 6 foot high orange and red Obey Andre the giant art mural covering an entire wall that dominated everything. Our corner room bordered two busy streets and was above a bar so lots of noise pretty much all night. I would request a back or interior room with less noise next time. The rooms have only a small metal sink and shared bathrooms. I was OK with the bathrooms but my boyfriend felt they lacked privacy and made the whole thing feel like a youth hostel or dorm.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR113503965">The Ace is a good bet for your money, if you're traveling on a budget. We got the standard room with the shared bath; the room was small but clean and the bed was comfy. Our room was facing the outer wall which is right above a lively street with lots of activity well past 3 am, but luckily we had ear plugs. The shared bathroom situation is fine; there was never a wait for one to open up and they do lock, so you have it to yourself once inside. The best thing about this Ace was the included continental breakfast: make-your-own-waffle station, fresh juice, Stumptown coffee (in to go cups!), bread and a toaster, granola, yogurt and fruit. It had everything I would want.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98007728">I had been to the ACE hotel in NYC (not to stay, to eat &amp; drink) and liked the style and vibe there. After looking at the Seattle web-site, I decided to book an overnight from Victoria, B.C. on a sea plane.Turned out upon arrival I had booked the wrong night, but they still had a room availible. Lucky it wasn't summer! Its a two story walk-up so there are no high floors or views, but when I travel, I just want a safe &amp; clean place to sleep, shower and store my belongings. The ACE in Seattle fulfilled my requirements. I was also fortunate to check in/out with Ed. He was very polite, professional, and personable. He gladly answered all my questions and gave me some tips and suggestions for places to go and see. The hotel is located in the "Belltown" neighbourhood and there are loads of bars &amp; restaurants within walking distance. I walked from Lake Union (float plane terminal) to the hotel then from there to PIKES PLACE Mrkt, the waterfront wharf district, through downtown, Pioneer Square, the football stadium, and then all the way back across d-town to the Spcae Needle in one afternoon/evening. At night I walked to a cool bar that Ed recomended. Its a secret Seattle location that only a local would know. From there the bartender sent me to the SPUR Restaurant where I had to try and not order everything off the menu. After 5 courses, incl. dessert, I walked it off. The area is safe but you need to keep your wits about you. There seemed to be alot of vagrants around so I just keeped on moving. I would definitley recomend the ACE Seattle to friends in my age range (20's to late 30's), but it's not for eveyone. As one of the reviews stated, the ACE Seattle is a cool adult hostel. But a really cool,hip, claen, and safe adult hostel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR90631720">We stayed at the Ace hotels in Portland, New York and Seattle on our most recent trip to the states and while we loved them all, the Seattle Ace was definitely not in the same league as the others (although it was also a lot cheaper). It was more like a trendy hostel than a hotel. That said, the staff were incredible, our room was cute (but very small), and the small touches (like stumptown coffee in the breakfast room) made it a great experience. Everything was clean and super safe and while the belltown area felt a little sketchy at times, it was close to plenty of great music venues and restaurants, and a short trip from capitol hill, which was definitely our favourite area. Even though Ace Seattle lacked the buzz of the New York and Portland Ace hotels, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend to recommend this hotel to young singles or couples for short stays in Seattle<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR84556179">Friendly helpful staff and location was the best part of this budget hotel with sub-IKEA furnishings, paper thin walls and the loudest hotel entryway ever experienced. A pleasant accommodation where you will not sleep before 2am waiting for the constant wave of the inebriated loud and festive trudging up the wooden stairs right outside the front rooms to cease and the relentless dance music underneath to end. More hostel crash pad than hip hotel. Can't recommend or return until somethings done about the noise.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81395044">My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Ace hotel for 2 nights while vacationing in Seattle. I was initially afraid of the shared bathroom concept, but the perfect reviews from everyone proved to be true and I'm glad I listened. There was never anyone in the hallways or in the spotless bathrooms. If you understand and appreciate good, modern design, this hotel is for you. My boyfriend and I both even appreciated the music playing quietly in the bathrooms... our kind of music! The front desk was friendly and wouldn't let me carry my bags up the stairs. The waffles at breakfast are delicious and the whole hotel has a fun feel to it. We stayed in a plush, private hotel in Vancouver on the same trip and my boyfriend and I both prefered the fun vibe of the Ace to that hotel. The rooms have everything you need and deliver it to you in a quirky and unique way.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR75106050">Loved this place. Nothing I didn't need, but everything I did. Everything is spotlessly clean and comfortable; the folks at the front desk are young and very helpful; the included breakfast was delicious (granola, yogurt, hard-core coffee, etc). Only downside is that the area (1st and Wall) can be a little sketchy late at night; during the day and evening, it's fine. If you're looking for a cushy place with a lounge and and bar, this isn't it. Additional note - it's on a main bus line, taxis run by frequently, and it's walking distance to Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR74191360">It's not a boutique hotel at all, and it's not a Marriott or chain-like in any way. This will satisfy all of your hipster yearnings, from the modernist furnishings to the lack of elevators and boxed water. Good beds, sheets, pillows, towels, and a very happening neighborhood if you want to party with the twenty to thirty-somethings. Breakfast is in the basement and is self serve, including make your own waffle. The coffee is not strong enough, but it's all you can drink. We would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR69150657">From the outside this hotel doesn't look like much, but everything inside was almost perfect. My GF and I were travelling with our two Chihuahuas and were reluctant to leave them in the room alone for a few hours. As it turned out, they were pretty well behaved, and didn't cause any problems. All the staff were very polite, considerate and understanding. The room we were in faced Wall St, so it was a little noisy at times. This didn't bother us much, but it may bother others as there is no A/C so you pretty well have to leave the windows open on a warm day. They do have a small fan to help with that as well. Rooms and (shared) bathrooms were very clean. As far as the location goes, it was very central. About a 6 min walk to the Space needle, and about 10 min walk to Pike Marketplace. Also, a lot of great restaurants and shops in the area too. The breakfast Ace provides was awesome! You can make your own waffles, or if you prefer, there is yogurt and granola, milk and OJ, and coffee. Overall, I'd rate this hotel a 5/5.<topic>none</topic>

The Belltown location affords you the opportunity to visit Pike Place, the waterfront district, numerous top-notch restaurants, and lots of shops. The austere decor, limited room furnishings, and cozy room measurements might be a potential put-off, but the helpful staff, great location, can't go wrong room pricing, and full Continental breakfast might win you over; it did us!

<comment category="positive" id="UR51674939">I chose this hotel because it was located in the center of our weekend activities and was a reasonable rate. I thought perhaps that we might not be hip enough to be comfortable there but I figured it was only one night so we could just try it out. I was wrong - we loved it! - comfortable bed (hard to find in a hotel!), very nice staff and cool eclectic style. We did discover that while I apparently could sleep in the city my husband could not but since I had read all the reviews I could find we had armed ourselves with earplugs - but the hotel was honest enough about its locale that they furnished these anyway. He used them but I did not. There are plenty of places to eat within 2 or 3 blocks and you aren't far removed from downtown. This was just a one night getaway as we don't live more then an hour from Seattle but we will definitely be going back the next time we are going to the big city!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR45670799">I stayed at the ACE Hotel recently and I must say that I was a bit scared upon first sight, but ended up really enjoying my stay. I travel often for business and was sick of the Sheraton and Marriott so I decided to try something that was a bit younger and unique. While it is not the Ritz, it is clean, the staff are WONDERFUL, and it is within walking distance of many awesome bars / clubs. Don't expect a lot of amenities - this is a very minimalistic hotel - you get the bare necessities. I would opt for the deluxe room as it has a bathroom, otherwise, it gets the hostel / college dorm vibe in a standard room. The only real downside was that the walls are paper thin, so don't do or say anything you wouldn't want your neighbors hearing!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR39582565">A great little hotel. Perfectly located and easy walking distance from everything you'd want to do centrally. Also a very short walk to the ferry terminal to catch the boat across to Vancouver Island. Staff were super helpful and friendly too. Rooms were clean, beds uber comfy and breakfast yummy. We stayed a night either side of Victoria - one night in a pretty small room with separate bathrooms and another night with an ensuite - both nights were great and all bathrooms, whether attached to the rooms or not, were ideal. We'd recommend this hotel for any length of stay in Seattle but it is ideal for a quick pit stop!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR38180759">This is a great hotel for the price. We stayed in a deluxe room for $165/night which had a queen bed, shower and toilet. The room had one unusual feature - the shower was separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. If you don't want to know your traveling companion that intimately I suggest you ask in advance about the shower design in your room. I gather from the posted pictures that not all rooms share the same design. Things that I particularly loved: self serve breakfast available until noon, coffee and tea avaiable all day, washer/dryer next to the kitchen, and location in a trendy and centrally located neighborhood.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34880285">We spent one night at the Ace Hotel in July 2009. We booked on expedia for a good rate (for the area) of $99 per night for a room with a double bed. The location was good for our purposes. Just a 10 minute walk from the Victoria Clipper dock and cruise ship terminal and a 15 minute walk from Pike Place Market. The neighborhood (Belltown)was kind of cool with a lot of restaurants and night life. The check in/out procedures were really easy and the hotel staff was very pleasant. The rooms were clean, minimalist, with a bed, sink, Ipod/music player and flat screen TV. There was no air conditioning, but the windows opened, so the room cooled down pretty well. Our room was on the street side. If you do not like street noise, ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. The rooms did not have a toilet or bathing facilities. There were five bathrooms, four with shower facilities down the hallway (for about a total of 30 rooms). They seemed to be cleaned pretty well, although I am sure not perfectly. Although the hotel seemed pretty full, we never had an issue finding one of the bathrooms or showers to use. Not ideal for many people and if we were staying for more than a couple of nights, this would have been an issue. They offer a breakfast in a room at the back of the hotel, downstairs a couple of floors, but we found a small bakery across the street which was pretty good, so we cannot comment on the breakfast. Overall, I could recommend this hotel if you don't mind sharing the bathroom. Otherwise, this is a good place to stay for a couple of nights if you can handle to shared facilities... if not, don't stay here.<topic>none</topic>

Great minimalist-style while at the same time managing to be cozy. Beds were very comfortable and everything was scrupulously clean. If youâ€™re turned off by the comparison to a hostel - don't be. It was nothing like any hostel we've ever been too. Itâ€™s more like house sitting in your hip buddiesâ€™ loft. Great eating and drinking establishments within walking distance.

<comment category="positive" id="UR26834646">The title about says it. It's sort of no-frills, but if you're fine with that, this is a great place to stay. The design and decor is modern but not in a pretentious way, the room is rather large for a city and fairly well-appointed, and the staff was friendly and helpful. For the price ($99/night), in a city, you can't beat it. We were in one of the rooms that had a common bathroom. If you're worried about that, don't be: there was always at least one free bathroom, and every bathroom was always clean. The one downside: The pillows weren't so great. If you can, bring your own - or maybe find a store and go buy one, especially if you'll be there for more than one night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR24966732">We went to Seattle for four days on vacation and chose the Ace due to its close proximity to restaurants and downtown. It is 'hip' and 'stylish' and there are Eames chairs in the lobby and that's all good, but ultimately what you have is a hostel converted into a hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. The beds are fine, and the aesthetic is right, but you really do get the feeling that everything was chosen so it would look good in a picture, not in real life. The quality of the materials (aside from the common-area furniture, which was all great) is quite poor, and looks like it all came from the As-Is section at IKEA. Other reviews indicate the night desk attendant is pompous and talks on the phone a lot- if you think this, you have to be completely wrong, because she was one of the most helpful people I've ever encountered in a hotel. 'Belltown' is sort of trendy, and the restaurants within two or three blocks of the hotel were incredible (i.e. the location if you don't have a car and want to walk is great), but I've never been panhandled so many times in my life (and I work in homelessness outreach) as I was within a block of this hotel. In the middle of the night EVERY night, there were fights and shouting and sirens, which woke us up constantly. If you're looking for a hostel, stay in a hostel. If you're looking for a hotel, stay in a hotel. If you're looking for an experience, and a bit of an adventure in being sleepless in... ah, forget that... (with excellent breakfast in the morning, I will say), try this.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR22621710">My boyfriend and I made a trip up to Seattle from Portland to check out the Deck the Halls Concert. I wanted to stay somewhere that wasn't a typical hotel, which is what I got with the Ace. I first wanted to book at this hotel because of the one in Portland, which I heard was stylish, unique, and the place to stay for twentysomethings. Second, upon seeing the website and learning that you shared a bathroom with the other guests if you have a standard room, I was in (because hey, I wanted a different hotel experience). Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night. At the same time, what can I expect when the hotel is located in a prime location and right alongside the main street? All in all, if you like a different hotel experience that somewhat resembles a dorm, then give the Ace a shot.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR21287282">We arrived at 8pm, the deluxe room we were given was small with no windows but a nice inside patio which was small but was an extension of our room and was somewhere to sit. We were tired after a flight from London so we just crashed. The following morning the manager asked us if we liked our room, we said we missed a window so he switched our room to a corner room which was a great improvement. We liked it and wanted to stay an extra night but the room had been requested so we checked out and went to the Hyatt for one night. The staff were friendly and the corner room we had was just fine, a little on the small side but the bathroom was big. I loved the style of the place, the staff and the location but the size of the rooms were the only gripe. I would stay there again but only for one night, and only if the room we had was a corner room with windows.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR21076424">My husband and I stayed at the Ace Hotel in Seattle for three nights and I was excited to book the room since the style of the hotel was far more up our alley than a floral B&amp;B or a Motel 6. We were happy with the first impressions. Our room was decent sized and bright on a corner with two windows (itâ€™s one pictured on their website) and with a Shepard Fairey wall. We asked the desk clerk about parking, since it does state on the website there is off street parking available. He wouldn't tell us anything more than â€œif you got street parking stay there until 8am when they start charging.â€� We couldn't get any lot info from him, so we drug our luggage to the room. Once we headed to bed things got worse. The bed size is not listed on the website and I assumed it would be queen. The beds are full sized which made sleeping comfortably a little difficult, but there wasn't much sleep happening in that room. The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car. The third night we were moved to a smaller interior room which was considerably quieter (we downed out the music we could still hear with the fan) and it was across the hall from the bathrooms. This room, without anything on the walls, definitely felt like a â€œniceâ€� dorm room. However we did sleep better. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling alone or with friends and do not plan on doing much sleeping, or perhaps you have loud roommates who come home drunk and play loud music all the time. The location is good for walking to attractions like the space needle and the market, and we did find a few good restaurants nearby. I just donâ€™t know if I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21019355">This was 'hip'. The rooms were fun, minimalist (i.e. lacking wardrobes), and spacious enough with large windows (we could just see the water). Things that I did not realise 'hip' would include: 1. I did not realise that breakfast was included - fresh fruit and the waffle machine I love. 2. I was not expecting was that the staff would be so friendly and let us check in early with our ten tons of luggage and then leave it all day on the day we checked out so that we could continue to explore the city. Everyone was so nice. 3. The location too was fabulous - just at the edge of the free bus zone, and not far from the sculpture park, surrounded by fabulous restaurants. 4. Shared bathrooms, 5 on the one floor we stayed on so never an issue getting into one for a shower in the morning and the showers were massive - could not reach from one side to the other. Do be aware that there is no lift (that I could find) and that the reception is up a rather large wide flight of steps off the main street - but the desk staff do help, which is lovely.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20807360">My husband and I spent four pleasant nights at the Ace. My husband and I were checking out Seattle for our future move to the area. I was a little wary because of some of the previous reviews, but I was totally pleased with my stay. The rooms are sparse, but just fine. It is aesthetic over function. My husband said the bed was uncomfortable, but I thought it was comfy. The mattress had a thick pad on top. I liked the wool blankets. The shared bathrooms were very clean. No need to bring soap, shampoo, or conditioner: it's provided. Plus they pipe nice music in! For breakfast they have a great waffle maker, plus granola, yogurt, toast, juice, and good coffee. Overall it was quiet, clean, pleasant, and fun. Okay, yes, the hallway lights are on until midnight and do shine into the window above your door. Seems a little silly. They should dim them at 10ish. And the younger people at the desk are uber-hip and unfamiliar with the nuances of hospitality- but they are all friendly enough. The exception was Ed (the manager, perhaps?) who was awesome. I asked him a million questions and he gave me great advice. They ask you to put a door hanger out requesting housekeeping service (instead of just doing it unasked), even though there is nowhere to hang your wet towels in your room. None of these were reasons to not stay here. Overall, it was a great deal for a room smack in the middle of Belltown. It was better than I expected.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20138575">Super location, wonderful staff, loved the style of the place, even our 8 year old daughter loved it - and that was even before they brought in the new waffle maker. It's small and cozy feeling even though it's all white. Interesting place... we'd definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19780687">Have stayed at three different rooms here during 2 stays over the last year. Happy enough the first time to return for a second. The value is great if you can score a room with the view out to Elliot Bay. Just beautiful. You dont need any more than the minimal ACe white decor with a view like this. Also enjoyed room with large glass shower also (no view). On the last occasion, $160 is a bit much for a small room with no view or special shower features. On both visits, found staff very friendly and helpful. The location is central. Late nite pizza/beer joint across the street is key after a long night. Breakfast included adds to the pleasure.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19583100">Overview: This hotel is marketed as modern design at a good price. It's definitely one of the more affordable places to stay in the area and the location is great. As a young couple, we felt right at home. Pros: We enjoyed our stay, it met our needs with style and was a fun change from more conventional hotels. Our room was clean, compact and comfy. It wasn't a huge room, it's definitely a compact design with everything in its place but we didn't feel cramped. We got one of the rooms with a bath attached. You can see in the photo that it was an open shower design, sort of Japanese style. You might think water would get everywhere, but that wasn't a problem. The breakfast provided the next morning was perfect--granola, DIY waffles, coffee, juice and tea. It's also located centrally, we walked to the art museum and other attractions with ease from the hotel. Great bars and restaurants are also nearby. Cons: The only con was that parking wasn't directly adjacent to the hotel and that the parking didn't seem to be in the best location. Parking was available but the lot was a couple blocks away. I made sure to park my car under a bright light in the lot because there were a lot of random men lurking about at one end of the lot.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18413044">The Seattle Ace Hotel overtly, if not aggressively, markets itself as a "hip" hotel. So if the rather advanced average age of the guests or the number of families with small children running around the place might make you doubt whether the Ace could really be all that hip, the management prominently displays--in a glass case in a small elevatorless lobby at the top of a very looooooong staircase--several copies of the book, "Hip Hotels USA," wherein one presumes the Ace is favorably and fashionably reviewed. But would true hipness so obviously advertise its hipness? And was Seattle Grunge ever really hip? That last question about grunge refers not to the hip-in-its-day musical sound that grew and flourished in Seattle twenty years ago, but refers to the molds, mildews, fungi, and other sporelike or spineless organisms growing and flourishing just last week in the shower stall and on the bathroom floor of my supposedly "deluxe" room at the Ace. Yes, small rooms, sparse dilapidated furnishings, and almost-all-white interiors do perhaps appeal to a monkish sensibility. But if you need a closet to hang a few of your clothes-- Sorry, there's not one, and no chest of drawers either. You'll have to make do with one of the three hooks on the wall, because that's all you get. I guess the ascetic style, if style is the right word, might be sorta hip in this overly materialistic age (although the room rates at the Ace suggest that the facility's management is not itself overly concerned with excessive materialism). But the thing with the almost-all-white interiors is that they show every fingerprint on doorjambs, cabinets, and window blinds in startlingly black and grimy detail. As to the sparse furnishings, one wonders, Can cheapness be hip? If so, let me put the question more precisely. Is cheapness hip, when it finds expression as particle-board furniture with skin-thin plastic veneer peeling from every corner? Is cheapness hip when it takes the form of an ugly white vinyl window blind adorned with greasey black fingerprint stains all along its lower margin. The stark white vinyl roller blinds, failing badly as an element of interior decoration, at least have the virtue of being easy to clean. But perhaps too much hipness would be lost with the disappearance of a few black fingerprints. Surely hipness must be more easily distinguishable from flop-house-ness. Okay, the flophouse comparison is too harsh (but after another year or so of downhill slide, might not be too far off the mark). A fairer comparison is a typical college dorm room, which would probably be slightly filthier, but with furniture in better condition. So if you think a college dorm room would be a hip place for grownups to hang out, then you'll probably like the Ace. Really, that's it.--a dumpy college dorm room painted white--complete with crumbling particle board furniture--except I forgot to mention the bathroom in our "deluxe room" had a sink that looked a lot like the ones in train sleeper cars in Europe. Wow, how cool is that!?!? Not particularly convenient, as anyone who's ever used a sink in a train car can attest--but how totally cool! And not only did they put one of those sinks in the bathroom, they also put a second one in the bedroom area, too, right where you'd expect to find a nightstand. Since there was no nightstand, we used the sink as a nightstand. No closets, no drawers, no nightstand, but two cool sinks. How cool is that?!?! So when you are brushing your teeth in the morning at the Ace, standing there in front of one of those cool metal sinks almost just like the ones in a Wagon Lits Sleeper, it might make you feel almost like you might have some vague spiritual connection with some really hip place that some really hip train in Europe could take you to. I guess I'm too old to know for sure whether the Ace Hotel is hip or not hip, but I will say that the physical condition and look of the place--the dirty dumpy dorm room style--manifests nothing beyond an immature aesthetic sensibility and a poorly supervised housekeeping staff. My guess is that the Ace's claim to hipness, though perhaps true years ago, has devolved down to a hollow marketing theme--a marketing theme that also serves quite well to disguise and excuse an uninspiring cheapness, a disconcerting uncleanliness, and a run-of-the-mill laziness. Or maybe I'm just not hip. Aside from its deteriorating physical condition, the Ace has other deficiencies, of which the overly "casual" attitude of its staff of never-quite-grew-up-thirty-year-old teenagers is among the least serious. Much more disturbing: Almost two months before my stay at the Ace, I had reserved and paid in full, in advance, for a "deluxe room with king bed." Upon my arrival, my wife and I were sent to the small, dingy room described above. The bed would be king-sized only for a pygmy monarch--barely six feet long and four feet wide, which does not qualify even as queen-sized and is actually a bit smaller than an ordinary double bed. The staff placed us in this depressing room with its tiny bed without giving an explanation or apology, and apparently would have kept silent about the switch if I had not spoken up. When I told the clerk at the desk that there must be some mistake and that we wished to be moved to a "deluxe room with king bed" as described on my reservation receipt, he replied that I could not be moved to another room because the hotel was full. He suggested that the problem was the fault of hotels.com, through whom we booked and paid for the room, but when I called hotels.com customer service, they did not accept responsibility. (The fact is, I don't care whose fault it was; I know it wasn't my fault!) The Ace clerk offered that, since the rack rate for the room I had been given was $20 less than the discount rate that I had negotiated in advance for a "deluxe room with king bed," perhaps a small refund could be arranged. I explained that, even with a refund, I would not have freely chosen to stay in the room I had been given. I would not have freely chosen to have slept in that room at a rate of a half or a third of what they proposed to charge. Indeed, I would not have freely chosen to sleep in that room, much less to bathe in that bathroom, even for free. Eventually, I was promised a slightly larger refund, which I have since received from hotels.com. Yet even if they had let me have the room for free, I would have much preferred to pay more for a better room in different hotel. Unfortunately, with the "Bite of Seattle" in full swing only few blocks away, there was nothing readily available except at an airport hotel. My wife and I were on vacation celebrating a "big" wedding anniversary (I won't say which "big" anniversary because you might conclude that I'm too old to understand true hipness), so I did not want to upset things by wasting precious vacation time disputing with the hotel management or searching for other accommodations. So, under extreme protest, we took the refund, bought a bottle of mold and mildew remover to spray down the shower, and stayed our three nights at the Ace. But Never Again! I don't care how hip they want people to think they are. One last irony that might provide some contrast: It so happens that the weekend before our weekend at the Ace, my wife and I stayed at the Seattle Pan Pacific, which is just a few blocks east. The rates for the two hotels are essentially the same (the Pan Pacific was actually cheaper if you don't count the refund we eventually got at the Ace), but other than that, there is no comparison between the dumpy and worn-out Ace and the lovely and comfortable Pan Pacific, with its interestingly and artfully decorated rooms, done in a contemporary pan-asian style; with its true king or queen beds; with its sumptuous bathrooms with huge jacuzzi tubs and separate walk in showers; with its well-maintained furnishings; and with its professional, polite, solicitous, yet discreet staff. Instead of splitting our Seattle time between the two hotels, I do so wish that we had just stayed on at the Pan Pacific.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18082462">A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle. We spent two nights here and found the room and staff to be great. The communal showers were immaculate and we never had to queue. The breakfast was also great. There was a bit of street noise coming from below (we were on the first floor) but there were ear plugs in our room. I would also highly recommend the bar (Cyclops) below the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17637131">My best friend and I stayed at the Ace from June 23rd thru June 28th. First of all, I have stayed at MANY hotels. The Ace was by far the coolest. As soon as we arrived we were hauling our luggage up the stairs and Ed the manager wouldnt let us carry our bags any farther. He jumped right up and carried them the rest of the way for us! Our room wasnt ready when we got there (4 hours before check in) but our wait was only about 15 minutes. When we got into our room we were so excited..we had room 106. It was very chic/hip. Bright white walls and a stainless steel sink. A flat screen tv attached to the wall and a view to die for...perfect for people watching! The hotel is right across the street from the Belltown Market, a little convienience store, and Belltown Pizza. The Cyclops downstairs was great. My friend and I both suffer from insomnia, and while yes it was very noisy outside, it didnt phase us one bit. We joked that our bed must have had sleeping crack in it! We slept like babies! The people at the front desk were great...Ed actually told us the best ferry to ride and where to go(we went to Bainbridge Island on his recomendation and it was beautiful!) The bathrooms were clean..and having to leave the room to shower was not a problem, they offered shampoo,conditioner, and bodywash in the shower. Breakfast was great. Coffee was strong. You could generally never tell that anyone else was staying at the hotel unless you saw them in the hallway. The employees leave the hotel at midnight and your room key works as the front door key...not a problem what so ever. The mirror in our room had the phrase "you are beautiful" etched into it. The area was FANTASTIC! 2nd ave is a blast as far as the bar scene goes! I 100% loved the Ace and would most def go back. In fact, I would love to plan a trip to one of the other Ace destinations just to get to experience it all over again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17171427">Very hip, very contemporary......very noisy! Great room (the revolving wall into the bathroom was fantastic!) but there's so much noise from the road outside....you really will be tempted to check if there's any glass in the windows. If you plan on being out until the wee hours every night (and need to get up early) this is the place for you.....if not I'd hesitate to recommend it. A pity because the location is spot on.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15124261">After arranging a much anticipated girl's weekend with a friend - and an escape from children...I was MORE than excited about sleeping through the night by myself. I may have children, but I still want to enjoy hip places and cool design etc...so, rather than stay at a boring run-of-the mill hotel - we opted for the Ace Hotel's digs. In order to ensure maximum uninterrupted sleep - we booked our own separate rooms. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were informed that the hotel was full and that there was a mix-up with our online reservation and that we only had one room with a small queen-sized bed (supposedly it was a deluxe room) in it. Normally I would "suck it up", and accept that this was just a simple mistake - but this time I was really annoyed. My irritation was partially attributed to the overall nonchalant attitude of the uber-cool reception person - who didn't really attempt to compensate us beyond a slightly lower rate for the room. In fact, as she checked for our reservation on her computer she printed a sheet off and refused to let us look at it when my friend asked if she could see it - wanting to cross-reference the information on the sheet against what we had written on our reservation. It was strange, so much so that it appeared as though the mistake had been made on their part - but they didn't want to admit to it, and were quick to blame the online booking system. There was almost an inference that somehow it was our fault for booking online. To add insult to injury, we were also told after shelling out a small fortune for parking at a lot across the street, that we could have had our parking at a reduced rate at another lot - not easily marked. Once in the room, we found it dingy and not as charming as the photos on their web-site would suggest. However, we did see a couple of other rooms when we were walking down the corridors, that looked a lot better than our room did. Anyway, aside from being a great location and decently priced - it was the overall experience that just wasn't impressive. A few days later I received an email from the hotel thanking me for staying with them etc..."we hope you enjoyed your stay with us...etc..." and I responded with an email outlining my frustrations with our accomodation. This is not like me - but this time around, I really needed to air my dissatisfaction. The hotel's manager replied with an apologetic email and offered a discount on a later night's stay - to be redeemed by May 1st, 2008. This seemed like a positive response to our negative experience and I planned to return to the hotel with my husband for a romantic get away. Well, the so-called compensatory offer was never acknowledged. In my multiple attempts to contact the manager with a specific date and weekend in my messages - NOTHING. He did not return my messages. So much for that! I don't know what happened, as there was no reply at all. I guess the hotel doesn't need my business! Anyway, perhaps my experience was an isolated case. In any event, I will not be planning another stay at the Ace any time soon.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14909721">We stayed at the Ace Hotel three nights (a Thursday through Sunday). For the price, the location is impossible to beat. We stayed in room 107, a corner room on the front with two windows. I only have two complaints about the room: it was noisy at night (the room was directly over a bar) and my husband's and my feet hung off the end of the bed. However, the room was otherwise quite comfortable, the atmosphere was modern and fun, breakfast was good (granola, yogurt, toast, coffee and juice), and as I said before, the location was fantastic. The shared bathrooms were clean and convenient. At this price, I would definitely stay at the Ace Hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR14476925">Great idea, but not such a great execution. I had a private room with a really cool hidden door to bathroom, but short cuts were clearly taken. Shower not the cleanest, bed not comfortable at all. My room had no access to natural light, but found out at end of stay I could have asked for another room. Would highly suggest rooms with shared baths instead.<topic>none</topic>

We found it to be a modern, chic little hotel with clean accomodations and a friendly staff. The manager, Ed, was great!

<comment category="positive" id="UR12693994">A very nice clean place. Stayed in a room with shared bath for 2 nights. Parking lot is two blocks away from the hotel by daily rate (you need to obtain a parking pass from the hotel). Convenience location and close to bus stop (about 5-10 mins). Take only 10-15 mins bus to Capitol Hill. The only bad things were that there was loud noise at night as our room is facing the street (we stayed there on a Friday and Saturday night). All and all it was a nice stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12557582">We stayed in Seattle at the Ace Hotel for 5 days and we loved it. It is in a great location in Belltown, directly opposite the Macrina Bakery, which is quite possibly the best breakfast/brunch/lunch place in Seattle, wtih fabulous baked goods. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Upon check-in, the friendly receptionist (whose name I forgot to ask...sorry!) gave us 4 fabulous food recommendations in the city, all of which we tried and loved. Being the foodies that we are, it's extemely important to us that we get good recommendations from the locals. The room was small, but totally adequate and the shared bathrooms and shower rooms were spotlessly clean. We enjoyed the simplicity of the hotel and the little extra touches, like the adjustable lighting, music in the bathrooms, and all the free, current magazines available in the lobby. The breakfast granola was really yummy, too. For the location, the amenities, and the price, I'd say the Ace is hard to beat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12021542">OMG! At the last minute my husband and I decided to take a last minute, spontaneous trip for a conference in the state of Washington. The service of the staff, especially the manager made the trip for us both! I flew from Hawaiii and my husband flew in from Michigan. I arrived early and tired to the hotel, but I was accomodated immediately with a lovely room. In the first room we stayed at there was a glass shower behind the bed. How wild is that? Then we were upgraded into another chic room that had a revolving bathroom door with a mirror on it. My husband thought it was the coolest thing and would like to build one in our house. The complimentary breakfast and the mint scented amenities were nice to have. The ambiance of the place was so warm and cozy. The manager gave us a list of great places to dine at and visit and we enjoyed them all! Truly, it was the warm and kind service that made me feel at home and welcomed to the beautiful state of Washington. I strongly recommend giving the manager a raise! Thank you for having us. We look forward to making a trip back!<topic>none</topic>

Breakfast was refreshing ( doesn't weigh you down all day ) and it is close to everything, bars and nightlife are all within walking distance and the staff had good suggestions.

<comment category="positive" id="UR10615938">I've stayed at the Ace probably 6 times over the past six years. It's in one of my favorite (and incredibly convenient) neighborhoods. There's tons of stuff to do, places to eat, and great shopping all in close walking distance. The staff this time was definitely better than before. The first couple times I stayed there (in 2001 and early 2002), the staff was really aloof and way too into the fact that they were working in a nicely designed, young, trendy hotel. But now every single staff person I encountered was super friendly, helpful, and cheery. That makes it an even better place to stay! Yes, the rooms are spare, a little chilly, and they don't have huge flatscreens in them. But if you just want an inexpensive, clean, centrally located place to crash, this is a great place. If you're looking for a plush bed, romantic surroundings, and room service, this isn't your place.<topic>none</topic>

They are going for a very minimalist modern thing so it is simple and austeer. We also got a room with a bathroom across the hall, there were many of them they were spaious and clean.

I had an inside room (quiet) with shared bathroom and found it perfect for my short stay in Seattle, but be warned that the Ace has a lot of stairs and no elevator. Also the showers in the shared bathrooms, fully tiled, generous in proportion and clean as a whistle, have no grab bars or safety mats.

<comment category="positive" id="UR8096256">The Ace is a very cool, centrally located hotel with an awesome staff. My wife and I stayed here in late June and early July and were definitely impressed. First, the location is awesome. It is located in the heart of Belltown, near great music clubs, Pike Place, downtown, and Capitol Hill. You couldn't ask for a better location, especially for those of us who like to walk and use public transportation. Note: the bus is free in the downtown area, only a couple blocks away. Also, the staff is great and provide a real local aspect to it all. We regularly asked questions on bus routes, good music venues, recommendations for local eateries, etc. We always got a very friendly response with good tips. The rooms are very clean, as are the bathrooms. All of this for less than a $100 bucks a night is a bargain. I definitely recommend the Ace for travelers who like a unique, cheap urban hotel with cool staff and design.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8057502">Overall I think the hotel is nice. It was ok for me as a single traveler. I did not care for the minimalist decor, lack of air conditioning, and lack of window screen. The website does not specifiy that there is only a/c in the rooms with bathrooms, so that is misleading. But I had a travel fan and kept the window open and it was fine. They turned off the hall light at 10pm, but this may be a bit late for east coast travelers like me. It is bright in the room until the hall light is turned off, but I'm sure they would turn it of earlier if asked. Good things-- The staff is super friendly and helpful. They carried my luggage up the stairs and back down again when I left. The beakfast is great and the setup is nice. The breakfast room has milk, orange juice, toast and jam, yogurt, granola and fruit. There are also trays so you can take it back to your room and a flat screen tv to watch. The bed and pillows were very comftorable and I really liked the bathrooms and the mint shampoo/conditioner. If I was traveling alone I would consider the Ace again. If they added some color to the decor it would be nicer I think.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7849907">When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage. We got to the top, checked in and were placed in the room at the very end of the hall. The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet. We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold. The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room. We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1" tiles. I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room. He said I had to check with Hotels.com since I prepaid and booked through them. Fair enough. He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see. Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems. He didnt offer to have us check another room or to investigate our concerns with the original room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5816860">I really stayed here about 8 months ago, but when I noticed all the horrible comments I just had to make my own. The concensus seems that if you're over 40 you most likely won't like this place. It's a different type of hotel, complete with condoms and kama sutra books. So anyone that's very religious might not find this too humorous, while others will think it's hilarious (as did I). Even the art on the walls weren't your typical boring hotel feel. I actually took pictures of this room because I loved it so much. Plus, the most fantastic part about my stay here (besides the great shampoo/conditioner and how the bathroom was designed in general) was the free breakfast! It wasn't your standard old banana with some concentrated OJ. It was make your own parfait, with fresh OJ and even Soy Milk. This is definitely for a certain type of crowd. And people that want something more luxurious shouldn't stay here. People that appreciate a cleaner more modern style should. Plus, it's located in Belltown, which is in walkable distance to Pike Place Market (where they throw the fish) and the Space Needle. Side note: They bought their cool Swiss blankets at the Army Navy Surplus store, which is right down the block from the hotel. Another side note: Macrina Bakery is considered one of the best breakfast/pastry places to eat in Seattle, which is right across the street from the hotel. Hope this steers people in the right direction.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5350973">Currently staying at the Ace Hotel on business, since other hotels downtown are booked. The hotel is decent, but more like a 2 star based on my experiences. Overall my experience has been just ok. The room is a "deluxe" room according to the hotel, which isn't very deluxe-it just means I get to avoid sharing a bathroom. So here's my summary: Pros: Location-Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Convinience store across the street. And an easy walk to downtown about 10 minutes. For those who don't want to walk, there's a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent service. If you walk a block or two further closer to downtown, you'll be within the "free ride" zone to save yourself a 1.25/1.50 at rush hour. Wireless Intenet included The hotel is clean. Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price. Cons: No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage. Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting. Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the "deluxe." Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that "motel" feeling. Also, you have to leave a "service room" tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as "leaving you alone," but I think it's more about saving money. Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a "boutique" hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle? That's definitely not aces.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5182600">Great hotel. The rooms are really fun - not huge but certainly different and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom but we never had to queue for one of them, even in the mornings - in fact, we could take our pick and they are palatious and clean. Don't worry about the noise either - our room was literally right over the Cyclops bar and if you have the window open it's noisy but as soon as you shut the window it's pretty quiet. Great location too - right in Belltown so loads of bars and restaurants nearby, 10 mins walk from the Space Needle and in the other direction, 10 minutes walk from downtown. Great value place to stay in Seattle, maybe not a place for the over 40s though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4474456">We stayed at the Ace Hotel on Presidents Day weekend. I requested Room 107 because I heard that it's the best room there (the one on their website). This room is situated at the corner of Wall &amp; First (you have great views of both streets..yes, windows on two walls) and right above the Cyclops Bar. The room gets kinda loud at night but if you can stand it, it's well worth it!! The Ace Hotel is right in the heart of Belltown so you don't have to go far to find the Seattle nightlife. I thought that the "shared bathrooms" deal was going to be a problem but everything worked out great. I never had a problem finding an open bathroom (total of 5 shared bathrooms). For parking, you can pay $17 (in &amp; out priv) to park in a lot that's about 2 blocks away (not bad) or try to find parking on the street (good luck). And of you choose to go out at night time, the front doors are locked at midnight but your room key can open it. I don't recommend the Ace Hotel for anyone looking to get pampered with a lot of amenities and service. Bottom line, the Ace Hotel enhanced the Seattle Experience for my girlfriend and I &amp; I'd stay there again.. wouldn't have it any other way!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4314952">This hotel couldn't be more convenient. It is a perfect hotel for a tourist who wants to be in the hip part of town. The hotel is located right at one edge of the "free zone" bus area near the Space Needle. There are plenty of restaurants and bars/clubs within a 3 block radius. The Pike Market is a 5 minute walk and Pioneer Square is only a 10 minute walk. But you can take the 1st Avenue bus and get to either even quicker. My boyfriend and I stayed in Room 111, which is a standard room right by the front desk with shared bath for only $95 per night. The room was definitely "cozy" (meaning small) but if you are a good tourist, you don't spend too much time in the hotel room, anyway. The hotel also offers rooms with a private bath, if necessary. Don't be "put off" by the shared bathroom situation though. The bathrooms are not dorm-like bathrooms where you are showering with strangers. Each shower and toilet is designed for individual use. They were super clean and offered all amenities (shampoo, conditioner, towels, hair dryer, etc...). It got a bit loud at night because of the club right downstairs but... I woke up once and went right back to sleep. The front desk staff is extremely helpful. They are all young locals so they can offer suggestions for any type of tourist activity. They lock the front door at midnight but the key to your room can open the front door. A continental breakfast is included in your room night fee and you should DEFINITELY take advantage. It begins at 8am. It includes cofee (of course), OJ, yogurt, granola, fruit and toast. It's a perfect start to the day. In the same area, you can take advantage of more amenities offered: washer &amp; dryer, vending machines, microwave, etc...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4005341">I was originally attracted to the Ace by the price (of course). I'll also admit the hype surrounding the Ace Hotel made me curious. I found both positive and negative hype across the internet, and booked the Ace with an open mind. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms and staff and overall value. If you've stayed at pensions in Europe and liked them, you'll be at home at the Ace. When I arrived I asked to upgrade from my single to a room with a washroom attached, imagining the worst about the Ace's communal washrooms. I needn't have worried. The ratio between rooms and washrooms is small. The washrooms are clean with a focus on white-tiled functionality. The room itself was small but I didn't feel I needed more. In relatively tiny area the Ace manages to fit in a comfortable bed, retro TV, desk and a stainless steel sink, all in an undeniably cool style. More than enough without feeling cramped. The staff was polite and interested, and offered well considered suggestions for food and entertainment. With perks like free Wi-Fi (a bit slow), free breakfast and parking, the Ace is a deal. That being said, if you are at all finicky about the hotels you stay at, the Ace may not be for you. Upon first entering the Ace you are overwhelmed by stairs reaching out of sight; note there is no elevator for your heavy luggage. The Ace sits above the Cyclops bar, a hangout for Gen Y hipsters. The music, chatter and cigarette smoke will filter up to your room. But that's all part of the vibrant area of Belltown that the Ace is in. Stay away if you're very particular about your room for the night. Stay at the Ace if you want value, location and style.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3531183">Was a bit sketchy about reserving a room here when I viewed the reviews of the Ace here on the website - but I did it anyway. I am glad I did. When Iarrived, the very handsome, very approachable and did I say handsome (?) Doug checked me into the hotel. He recommended places to eat, how to get around and where to find parking. He then offered to send beer to my room with ice. Not necessary at all. And wow, he was very handsome... My room was 117 - one of the rooms on it's website. Yes, the mattress was firm (I believe it was actually a futon mattress) laid upon a block set above the floor. The room was clean, complete with Kama Sutra and condoms... Only downfall was the television was broken but when the staff was notified, a brand new one was installed in the room. The shared bathrooms were always clean, secure, and I felt comfortable using them at any hour of the night. The housekeeping staff, although not always easy to understand *primary language was Spanish, I believe* always had a smile on their faces and were cheery in the morning downstairs in the breakfast area. (A continental breakfast is included... just loved watching my fellow hotel mates wobble down the stairs hungover.) I will definitely stay here again when I come to Seattle... hope Doug is there. ;)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3285240">We made an internet reservation for a Friday, then rang an hour later to add Thursday to the booking. On Thursday, we rang to let them know we'd be arriving late, they said "no problem". We arrive at 10.30pm to hear: "Oh, we don't have your booking for tonight. We don't have a room for you." Total apathy, not concerned at all. Says a few sorrys, looks at the reservation book, more sorrys, more apathy. Finally says, "There's a B&amp;B next door" then calls someone in authority, hangs up and says sorry several more times. Incompetence all around from management to employees.

A month later, $240.57 (Canadian) had been charged on our credit card but we have since trashed the cancellation record. Given, we should have kept the number but the manager had been unhelpful, unsympathetic and snobby! Shame on them for being in the service industry. For $240.57, they have lost not only my business, but also of my colleagues and friends.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3237566">Generally i'm not a picky traveller, and i've stayed at the ace several times in the past 2 yrs but the this last visit will be the last. The Ace is a great concept, hipper than thou warholian installation a la auberge. Knowing that some rooms are better than others I reserved well in advance and requested one of the deluxe rooms in the back. When i arrived they'd given the room to someone else offering the excuse, "well, the previous guest decided to stay an extra day", and the front desk person was very rude and put out by the whole exchange. The room i ended up with was small dark and very noisy. It was impossible to sleep or enjoy staying in the room as you could hear everthing from the adjacent rooms. Nothing like listening to "Cops" blasting from the room next door at 1AM, or hearing your neighbors snoring, coughing, flushing their toilet, and wondering how much they could hear as well. Unless you're twenty something and planning on partying all night and coming home and passing out aka leading the psuedo rock star life style i suggest stearing clear. There are plenty of other places in the area to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2593910">The single rooms in this hotel are so sparse (which is intentional, I know) and ugly that it seemed like we were trapped in a hospital - all white walls, sink basin in room, small rectangle shape.

<comment category="positive" id="UR2514935">Two old ladies, returning from an Alaskan cruise, drove up to the Ace Hotel in a cab. After having wrestled with eight pieces of luggage for several days, they were dumbfounded to see that the hotel is a walkup. No problemo. A couple fellas got the luggage both in and out of the hotel in fine form. The only thing the ladies had to do with their pieces of luggage was sit on them in order to zip them back up. Soooooo......staff was helpful in every regard, rooms were clean and interesting. Thoughtful of the maid to leave the ladies a package of M&amp;Ms instead of the Kama Sutra book and a condom.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR1871939">My first stay at the ace was good: hip sublime minimal ... unfortunately it's been downhill from there. My second and third visits proved to be frustrating, irritating and uncomfortable. The rooms have been small, dark, with hollow sheet rock walls seperating the rooms. You can hear everything .... EVERYTHING. The neighbors on one side left their tv on all night (it's probably still on), the ones on the other side came home around 2AM had loud sex and then spent the rest of the morning puking in the bathroom (another reason not to opt for a shared bath). There is no service except for there front desk where you'll find a terse urban hipster with multiple peircings reading a magazine and chatting on her cell phone who makes it known that you are a bother. The place has great possibities, unfortunately they are not realized. After 3 visits I give up.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR1757703">I stayed at The Ace for 5 days this March and really liked it. It was clean, very accessible to nearby restaurants (some pricey ones though so be aware), and had a nice staff. They were helpful in suggestions on where to eat and one nice woman helped my boyfriend and I down the stairs with our luggage which wasn't necessary but very nice of her. I really liked the decor of the room too. It was simple but perfect if you're used to non-fussy places. The shared bathrooms were clean and the maids cleaned the room up nicely every day. I didn't encounter any noise problems but that is because when I booked the room, I specifically asked for a quieter side that did not face the noisey street. It was quiet and pleasant and I'm a light sleeper. The Cyclops downstairs had good food and a fun atmostsphere. One drawback I would say is that it's hard to find an inexpensive place to get something to eat in the neighborhood. Also, going alone to the bathroom at night seemed a bit sketchy because the halls were very dimly lit to look cooler, I guess but I was a little paranoid of going to the shared bathrooms without my boyfriend in the middle of the night. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the place to anyone who wants a fun, no-frills place to stay that's convenient to everything.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR1559494">My friend booked this hotel so that we wouldn't have to drive or take a taxi for a weekend in Seattle. I loved the look of the hotel. We got a deluxe room with a private bath. The only downfall of the hotel is its staff. My poor friend spent about 20 minutes drive around looking for parking while another friend tried to get the front desk clerk to tell her where we could park but he was too busy on a personal call to talk to her. We finally did find parking on our own. He seemed sort of blasÃ© about the entire thing. Well, besides the staff, I loved the hotel and we had a great weekend.

<comment category="negative" id="UR751328458">Value + Lake Union views This somewhat aged hotel is in walking distance to nothing, BUT it is a short drive to everything: the zoo, the downtown, the Space Needle parks. The staff are friendly (the lady in the kitchen is a kick), the breakfast is serviceable, and the parking is fabulous. You should request a room in one of the buildings with great views, and you will love waking up to boats and kayakers on Lake Union below. The rooms and linens are clean, utilitarian, with plenty of space.<topic>none</topic>

You can drive downtown in just minutes and the rooms are clean, pools is fine, and the views are wonderful. The setting is on the side of a hill overlooking Lake Union just 5 min. north of downtown. Not much within walking distance, and trying to find places to eat without going downtown was not too easy, but after a day it got easier to find things.<topic>none</topic>

This adults only resort is one of the best going right now in our opinion. Its it own resort with restaurants,pools, private beach and etc.... ans you get to use all other Palladium Resorts and they cant use yours. We stayed in a honeymoon suite and we were treated fantastic. You have your own personal butler that's makes sure your stay is fantastic right down from your own request on what you want in your fridge to them making of your restaurant reservations. The beach i would rate one of the best i have seen. We have been to a lot of adults only resorts and this place is by far the best we have been too. We will definitely be back!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR304233236">Beautiful two weeks in Paradise I just returned home from a relaxing two weeks in Paradise! The airport in Punta Cana is a wonderful, traditional open air airport. From the start you are put into the tropical mood by getting off the plane by walking down the steps onto the tarmac. The open air airport really gives you a feel of going back in time. Domincan clad ladies greet you and take a picture as you arrive which you can purchase on your departure for 8.00 US. We were then off to our van to be on our way to the resort, this drive was about 20 minutes or so. We were early but were given our room about an hour after we arrived so we went to have lunch at the El Behique beach buffett. Upon arrival the resort is breathtakingingly beautiful. After lunch we were assigned our rooms. Our freinds and us both got ground floor rooms which was dissapointing at first but we came to love not having to trek up the marble steps every day after a long day at the beach. They put us down the hall from each other which was very convienient. We had several issues with our room, it was musty and I always read this on your site and think the people are just being picky since it is a beach resort that you should expect it but this place really was musty. We found that our air conditioning did not cool to a proper tempurature and my Husband addressed this with the front desk 6 times and it was never resolved but we made do. We left our key card in the slot so that it would run all the time and it made it bearable. Our freinds room was fine and there air kept there room very cool. Our lighting was weird, you had to have the lights on at the sink to work the light in the bathroom area which was alright except for in the middle of the night when you would get up to go to the bathroom. Other than these issues everything was great and we could have changed rooms the next day but I did not want to bother with packing up everything again just to move. Our only negative issue was the food. We have been to many resorts all over the Carribean and this by far was the worst food I have ever had at any. I can not pin point if it was the style of the food or just the food itself. There were not many American's there. Most of the people were from Europe so maybe they were catering to the tastes of them but we really did not enjoy it at all. We basically only liked the Italian restaraunt, we went there 4 times and hit the pasta bar at the buffetts also. The guys would only eat pizza and french fries closer to the end of our two weeks because they had major bathroom issues. Nobody got actually sick in our party but it did go straight through so take your pepto and immodium. Breakfast was pretty good since you could get pancakes and waffles and french toast. We hated the coffee, it was way tooooo strong for us and like I said before this was just our preferance, the Europeans loved it. My freind and I took advantage of the spa on one day and were dissapointed, it was more like a gym inside a spa. You had to share the two large jacuzzies with other people although they will include them in your spa package like your getting a private jacuzzi soak and the massage was good but other than that it was not really worth taking time out of your vacation for it. I would opt for a massage on the beach instead of using the spa itself. Nobody speaks English at this resort so most of our issues may have spanned from not being able to get across what we needed or wanted but you really cannot complain about that since we were the minority and there are so many languges these people would have to learn to please everyone there. I would say the majority would be Spanish and French. There were some German but not many. All in all it was a nice stay, the jacuzzie's in the rooms were nice. The beach was just heavenly and this saved the whole vacation for us. We have never seen a more beautiful sky or beach or large palm trees. The grounds are gorgeous and everything is very pretty. The good thing is none of us gained any weight on our vacation so this actually worked in our favor. The sports bar is really nice and we also took the Saona Island tour which was awsome and we highly recommend it. Go and have a great time!!! Book the Suites though if you want more romance and quiet since it is an all adult beach/pool. Our pool bar was the best! It was well worth the upgrade.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR656911927">Had a wonderful time My husband and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Royal Suites portion of the Grand Palladium and were very pleased. Here are our thoughts....feel free to email if you have questions about any of the palladium sections. we did a lot of walking around and comparing. FYI-DON'T PUT ANYTHING EXPENSIVE IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE - yes, it seems obvious but we did and unfortunately, by the time we made it back to texas, we realized our camcorder was stolen. the airline has been really nice working with us, but it still stinks.Biggest perks about royal suites compared to other parts of the grand palladium: no kids, guaranteed direct access to the beach/pool and view of the pool, free internet and premium liquor, access to royal gourmet restaurant...overall, generally less crowded with a more mature group of people staying thereBiggest negatives (compared to other parts of the Palladium): the location. most of the a la cartes and the theatres are in the bavaro section...all the way on the other side of the complex. though you could walk it, it might take a good 30 min or more to get over there. there is a tram that stops by the rooms, but it's often full and even then, it takes a long time to get to where you want to go. ______________________________________For those who want more specifics.....Beaches: Fabulous! Probably some of the best we've ever visited. Weather was great and the water was really clear. Yes, you have to play the 'towel game' and reserve a spot at the pool or the beach, but we never had a problem with this. There was always some place on the beach open (and there aren't really any bad spots) or at the pool. Food: we thought it was really good, but we also had realistic expectations. it's similar to what you would find on a cruise. We thought there were plenty of options, and for the most part, we could always find something we liked to eat. We ate at the Royal gourmet, japenese, spanish, and seafood places. They only one we would not give a positive review was the seafood. the service was lacking and slow, not enough menus, the food was way over salted, etc. Plus, even though the lobster was considered 'all-inclusive' at the royal gourmet, it was $33 here. Rooms: We were in the royal jr suite and felt it suited us perfectly. i don't have any complaints. The minifridge was restocked every day, the rooms cleaned every day, we were on the first floor with a balcony facing the pool, we had a jacuzzi tub, a sitting area, nice tv, safe, etc. Activities: we chose to mostly sit on the beach...beautiful and quiet. we went to the shows every night, and though often very cheesy (uh - can we say michael jackson show)...we were really entertained. we went to the spa one day. that was great and the staff was very professional. we went parasailing...way overpriced. wouldn't do it again. we paid $30 to take a boat taxi around the ship wreck, we thought that was pretty cool. we went deep sea fishing with mike's marina. though it was fun, turned out to just be an expensive boat ride because we didn't catch anything. One thing to note....the place shuts down pretty much around 11 unless you want to go to the disco (which was lacking).Tipping: couldn't quite figure this out. we tried to throw down a couple of bucks when we could (like at the restaurants, bars, and spa). It seemed like the only people that expected it were the people we were doing the 'activities' with (e.g. the parasailing and deep sea fishing).Hope this was helpful!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR105203552">Nothing "Royal" about it After reading many positive reviews for the Royal Suites, we were very excited to book our 7 night vacation. We were not impressed! The beaches in Punta Cana are about the best you will find! That is about the only positive I can say about this trip.This Grand Palladium complex is enormous, and is geared for a european crowd. At the gift shop/supermarket you cannot find a single publication in English. Not a newspaper, not a magazine! I would say there was approximately 95% German travelers. No more than 2% were english speaking. The food is, at best, mediocre. The one meal that was excellent was the grilled lobster Sunday evening in the Royal Gourmet. We also tried the Asian and Mexican. We did not enjoy either. Buffets were not very good either. Both variety and selection were lacking. The Royal Junior Suite we had was really nothing special. Room was kept acceptably clean. We tipped the maid several times throughout the week. Nothing special was noticed, not even a simple towel animal The bed was terrible, and the pillows worse! We had to ask three times over the course of a day for extra pillows before any were brought to the room. Furniture was old and in need of replacement. Mini-bar was serviced only after requesting at the front desk. It was then stocked with warm beverages. We had to then travel back to the lobby to find cold beverages, which we did for most of the week as the mini bar rarely had anything in it! We thought the way the toilet and shower were laid out was very odd. They were simply like two closets with glass swinging doors on them, with open space on top and bottom. The toilet provided little privacy. The pool area was very nice, but the pool was always in need of a cleaning, and was also in some disrepair. Wood foot bridges over the pool were in need of paint.Loungers were nearly impossible to be had in either the pool or beach areas unless you played the 'towel game'. Even then, we had loungers taken on two occasions when we had towels on them. We heard about a fight on the beach over this. Ridiculous!! We also found some of the loungers to be broken.We found the service to be hit or miss. Mostly miss! Along with the pillow and mini-bar issues mentioned earlier, restaurant service was no better. Table set-ups were many times missing silverware. Asking for coffee several times, being repeatedly told it was on the way, and then never getting it. Having to go to the bar to get your own drinks during dinner because your waiter never comes back to check on you. I could go on.Punta Cana has become an extremely popular vacation destination. The amount of people traveling there has increased greatly in the last few years. The Punta Cana Airport is already undersized, and very inefficient. Lines were incredibly long and disorganized, with no one to offer direction. Out of six or eight security stations available, two were open. They just haven't figured out how to deal with large crowds. I just can't understand how so many reviewers can say this is a great resort. Were we just there on a bad week? I don't think so.We have traveled extensively in the Riviera Maya of Mexico, as well as several other Caribbean destinations. There are much better resorts to be found.But, as they say-To each his own.This was our third trip to the DR. Once to Puerta Plata, twice to Punta Cana. It will be our last.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR885761571">Our 3rd time at Royal Suites We, this time a group of 6 people from Finland, just returned from our 5th trip to Punta Cana and 3rd stay at Grand Palladium Royal Suites, which is now called Royal Suites Turquesa under the new brand name Royal Suites by Palladium.Why somebody in general travels to the same resort another time or many times to Grand Palladium Resort Royal Suites???. In general I would say simply: when you take the same target another or more times, you know how to have your enjoyment there.In our case the answer to many times question is very easy, because we`ve been and seen to some other resorts also in Punta Cana Playa Bavaro area.1) Grand Palladium Resort is large enough for 1-2 weeks vacations (4 hotels, about 12 restaurants, lots of bars), works well and is a well-maintained nature beach paradise. 2) Royal Suites Turquesa is just for us: - peaceful relaxation, - good food and drinks, - spacious beautiful seaview rooms with jazucci in/outdoor, - own pool with swim-up bar (thanks to Danny, Santo) - personal contact with the kind personnel- good service with nice humor3) We especially liked the Royal Gourmet Restaurant, which was new to us. Thanks to Juan, Ana, and many others for taking care of our needs.4) Royal Suites Turquesa recepcion and lobby is a nice place for spending your leisure time with newpapers, internet access and good drinks. Thanks to Edward, Daniela, waiters and all others for good services. 5) Newly opened Renova Spa is just in front of Royal Suites. 6) One of the best things in my mind is that the hotel management is all the time doing a good job to keep the wheels rolling.7) Finally, as I have heard the resort is continuously developing for our next trip, and so we have started to plan our next trip to Royal Suites.Have a good vacation wherever you travel, but be aware where you are going to!Frequent travelers from FInland Europe<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126117239">I cannot say enough good things about this place. I did business in Seattle for a week and needed a quiet, clean place to stay. Every one of the staff I came across was courteous, helpful, and friendly. The hotel is attached to the hospital, and I ate most of my meals at the hospital cafeteria which was priced right and had many healthy options. This is a good no-frills hotel for people traveling on a budget who want to be comfortable. You will definitely not regret staying here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124091099">I recently stayed at the Inn at Viginia Mason on a business trip for the first time. The front desk was very helpful and friendly. It was charming, quiet, roomy, and offered much more than I ever expected. The Rhododedron Restaurant adjacent to the lobby had excellent food and service. I can't wait to stay at the Inn @ VM on my next trip this summer and sip a cocktail on the rooftop deck with a great view of the city and the water. A great way to relax at the end of a work day.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123038840">Recently I stayed at the inn at Virginia Mason in Seattle. I usually stay at the Inn at the Market near the Public Market, but this time I had business at Virginia Mason Medical center, so I chose to stay close by. While the Inn at Virginia Mason is an old hotel, it is kept very clean and tidy, and the personal service offered by the front desk staff was great. It is well-located with several good restaurants near and a restaurant in the hotel as well. This hotel is ideal for patients at Virginia Mason Medical Center, as there is an elevator that connects (via sky-bridge walkway) the hotel with the medical center. There is storage for guest's baggage and I heard from more than one guest that hotel staff delivered their bags to their hospital rooms for them. Yes, this hotel is a bit dated, but it's clean and the price is right for a Seattle hotel in a good location. Tip: is you call the toll free number to make a reservation they give you an additional $10 per night off the the internet reservations price. I ate at Konpai, a Japanese restaurant near the hotel, and it was fabulous and very affordable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117362853">We searched on line for somewhere to stay in Seattle for a LONG time. It seemed all the choices were either very expensive and fancy or a little less expensive with shared bathrooms/no parking/other issues. We settled on Inn at Virginia Mason and it was a great choice. It's one of the lower cost hotels in downtown Seattle, the parking fee is not horrendous ($18 overnight), it's a clean/safe place, and - best of all - room service until 11 pm with low cost, really good food. And gratuities are not allowed! A very good choice if you need to stay in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117091827">This is not some tricked out fancy hotel with a thousand pillows on the bed and a spa tub. It is however a comfortable, simple, even plain hotel with a charming small restaurant on the first floor. The rooms are average size. There is a TV. There is no air conditioning, but I got a fan and managed to keep the room very comfortable. This is probably the only real drawback in the summer. There was plenty of room in bathroom, but it lacked counter space. But, the dressing area next to it had a shelf. My room had an OK view out toward the sound. I loved waking up to the sound of seagulls. The location is terrific. It is just a couple of blocks to the heart of downtown Seattle. I could easily walk to everything. There are 3-4 restaurants/bakeries in the adjacent block. I found FREE parking every night during my stay. The hotel has FREE Internet.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117001427">We stayed here for 2 nights. When we arrived, there were hairs on the bathroom floor, which we complained about; they were cleaned up. There were also toenail clippings by the night table on one side of the bed; they might have been hard to reach with a vacuum since they were close to the night table, but should have been taken care of. The first morning, the maid walked in without knocking at 7:45 am. She then closed the door and left without even apologizing. We complained to the front desk, and they were responsive, but said that the maids have been specifically told not to do that, so they were frustrated with the maid. When I complained, I noticed a list of other complaints already made that day--and it was only 8:30 am. We also received a wake up call, which we had not requested. (I noticed on the list that someone else, who HAD requested one, had NOT received it.) While the location of this hotel is very convenient, I would not recommend it based on the above. Also, if you have difficulty walking up hills, this is not the place for you, since it stands at the top of a very steep hill (and you do not need to go up this hill to see Seattle attractions).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112406737">Wonderful gem of a place. Great value and location for going to the Conference Center (I suggest walking via beautiful Freeway Park). Room was spacious, staff was friendly, internet was dependable, and the food was fantastic. The Rhododendron restaurant in the lobby is open weekdays and has good quality at reasonable prices (as well as fun and friendly staff). The inn is attached to Virginia Mason Hospital, so the room service calls down to the hospital kitchen, but the food was actually great and incredibly cheap (milkshakes and personal pan pizza to your room at 10pm for 8 bucks? Sure!) I started ordering room service because it was cheaper than everywhere except McD's and a better value. Only downside was that it was an old building, and the bathrooms reflected that in the fixtures. Still, for the price, and access to that room service? Excellent value and highly recommended.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR109432248">Nothing fancy here, if you are looking for a place to spend the night, then it may work for you. I got a good deal over the phone, and since I was not looking for anything fancy, it suited me well. However I do think they can make the rooms a bit more clean - with clean sheets, towels and a well scrubbed floor. It looks like an old place, it is an old place. Would work well if you are visiting someone in the hospital.Has a good lobby, the restaurant is OK, the menu is limited, but the food tastes good.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR80377871">This hotel is very convenient for people visiting patients in the hospital. The lobby is beautiful, the room is very spacious. Great roof top view with tables and chairs. The room needed some repairs: TV problems, windows wouldn't open (we had 4 windows in room), needed light bulbs, needed a plumber...All was fixed when I made the request. Breakfast was good, but they only had one person and she was working her tail off. We ended up eating breakfast at the Corner Cafe about a block away. It was great. This hotel is at the top of a hill, but my husband and I both enjoy the exercise. I would only recommend it by also adding the issues we had and to make sure all is in working order.<topic>none</topic>

When she arrived at the Inn on Virginia Mason they did not have a room! They put her in a hotel 5 miles away.

<comment category="positive" id="UR66552265">First let me say that we like old hotels. If you are the Holiday Inn Express type, this is not for you. The Inn at Virginia Mason was built in the late 20's, and has been well restored and maintained. Carpet, furnishings and decor were good quality, in good condition and stylistically appropriate for the era. The bathroom was small but all the plumbing was modern and functional. The hot water room heating system was unusual: like a giant valence hung from the ceiling across the tops of the windows. It kept the room at a comfortable 72-76 deg F (no matter where the wall thermostat was set). The restaurant menu was small but the food and service excellent. The location is exceptionally convenient if you have business at Virgina Mason Clinic or Hospital. The Inn is connected to the clinic, so you can get to any department without going outside (or climbing any hills). It's about a 15-20 minute walk to downtown and Pike Place Market (double that back up the hill). Bus service on routes 10/12 will get you there quickly and cheaply. While you are at the Inn, cross the street to the Baroness Hotel and check out its beautiful Art Deco lobby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR65632960">While staying at this hotel, I had approximately 35 percocet stolen from my medicine bag. Since many people stay here to be with loved ones during recovery from surgery, I imagine the housekeeping staff are quite aware that narcotics can be in the rooms. In addition, the employee had to look through my bags to find the pills. If I had more time, I would have reported this to the hotel and filed a police report. However, I expected this would be a giant waste of time which I was short of. When I got home, I emailed the hotel and have yet to receive a response. If you must stay here or at the Baroness, I urge all to leave nothing of value in your rooms. Also, the associated parking (down a very steep hill and a block away) was extremely expensive.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR43978512">I needed to go to a conference and I was only staying in Seattle for less than 24 hours. I could not see me paying $200 a night at the hotel where the seminar was held. After reading the reviews, I pretty much knew what I was in for. When I stayed there was no loud construction, but it was a weekend. I did see patient across from me thru the window, but I'm in the medical field and that didn't bother me. I was over the hospital air conditioning unit which was bothersome. The air condition was not all that great but I did open the window for awhile. No hair dryer or coffee pot which is not all that of a big deal, however when you need to wake up at 5:30 I would of liked a little kick start. The location was great. I walked everywhere I needed to....definitely bring your tennis shoes . The hotel across the street, which you need to check in was pleasant and hassle free. This hotel was not the greatest but the reviews were helpful before I checked in and it worked for me.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20159196">Stayed there on a weekend when it was impossible to find a room in Seattle. It was a bit high priced, $160 after taxes, but it wasn't that bad at all. Doing my research I found that this building used to be an apartment building turned hotel/inn. The rooms are very apartment like and was very surprised at the size of the room! (Room 811). There was construction around the inn, but none going on during our stay on a Saturday night. The air conditioning faired well, and the very old TV served us well in the morning. The elevator is not as rickety as described. The hill is a bit steep, but if you're younger it's do-able. Very close to Pike Market and close to Seattle Center, the Space Needle is a short Monorail ride away. I quite enjoyed my stay at the Virgina Mason Inn!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18939147">Although the location was very convenient (a 10-15 minute downhill walk to Pike Place Market), this hotel was dissapointing. We had just come off the I-5 after a HOT day of driving and there was no air conditioning, which was not mentioned on the website. There was a note on the window asking that we leave windows closed as there were renovations going on at the hospital 20 feet away from the hotel, also not mentioned on the website. We had to wait for the ancient elevator to go up one floor because the stairwells were closed due to renovations going on in the hotel...again, not mentioned on the website. The room we had was very old, dingy and smelled stale, and there were dried drips and spots on the bathroom walls. Construction went on until at least 7pm and started again at 6:30am. Both available parking garages were located down a very steep hill. These things should be taken into consideration for people staying there for medical reasons. The desk staff were very good at apologizing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11906968">My wife and I stayed here for a few days last summer while we were on vacation. It's located about seven blocks (up some very steep hills) from the water front. It's perhaps about 3/4 of a mile from downtown and located in a quiet neighborhood. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to downtown and its price. When you walk in the lobby is nice, staff are friendly. It turned out a number of rooms were available and the woman at the front desk talked us through which room we'd like based on the view. The room was really large. There was even a "changing area" adjacent to the bathroom. The room had a fantastic view of downtown Seattle and the waterfront. The Hotel is attached to a hospital that bears the same name. Many of the people staying there were clearly there for medical reasons. It's for that reason why I would slightly hesitate to recommend the hotel to leisure travelers. Having said that, it's really nice inside, and you'd never know it was attached to a hospital if you didn't see the signs directing you to where the hospital is.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5576196">This was a decent, quiet little hotel. Given that it was one of the cheapest we could find in the city, I should be giving it a much higher rating. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning decent (this was important given the heat wave we encountered). It is conveniently located a short walk from downtown. Athough as has been mentioned there's an incredibly steep hill you'll have to climb if you want to walk back. Okay neighbourhood, we never felt insecure about walking around at night. The staff were very friendly upon arrival and were able to give us information on local events and attractions. We only spent one night here and didn't try the restaurant. The rest of our stay in Seattle we rented a small studio/cottage on Bainbridge Island for only $150/night (highly recommended as the prices are cheaper than in Seattle and it's only a 30 min, $6 return ferry ride right downtown)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3742128">If you arrive in downtown Seattle via public transportation, the first thing you'll notice about Virginia Mason is the hike up First Hill. (I'd told the kids to pack light.) Though the Inn seemed a bit too out of the way initially, I was grateful for the location when evening arrived and the huge SeaFair parade began weaving through downtown. We were able to walk to most of the attractions in Seattle from the hotel: downhill to the waterfront, over to the Space Needle, back to Pioneer Square. Though the kids complained about the lack of a pool, the room itself was spacious and clean, with a bathroom big enough for a small party and enough beds to accommodate our family of six. The staff was pleasant and accommodating, plus the place felt cozy--a pleasant contrast to the chains where we spent most of our vacation.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3722050">We reserved room 611 for the nights of July 25-26, 2005. We arrived on 7-25 as expected and found our room waiting. It was nice, clean and comfortable. My wife was having brain aneurism surgery on the morning of 7-26, so we left early. My son had driven in that morning and we were going to use the same room that night. He was replacing my wife as she was in ICU. At 11:45 am we called to make sure the room was available and we were told it was all ready for us. That evening we left the ICU and got back to the room about 10:30 PM. We immediately found someone else in our room (611). The desk was very helpful and tried to find us a room in another hotel to no avail. A lady assisted the clerk and located a room in the hotel that no one was using (604). We waited for it to be cleaned. She came back and said she would 'comp' the room to us for the night of 7-26 since they had given our original room away. She then said they would hold that room for us since my wife was to be released on 7-27 and the hospital wanted us to stay in Seattle one more night before returning to our home in Spokane, Wa. We would pay for the 2nd night in room 604. My wife was released from ICU at 7:30 PM. We started for our room, but just to be safe, I called ahead only to learn that it too had been given to someone else during the day. The same lady that had saved it for us was the one I talked to. Again, she was very nice and apologized, but we had no room. We were asked to come over and they would see if there was anything they could do about locating something else since they were full. At this point with my wife hurting and in need of a place to stay, we decided to head east toward home and see if we could locate something else which we finally did...in Ellensburg. Fool me once, shame on you...Fool me twice, shame on me!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR2289920">My wife and I stayed at the Inn mid-Spring and were delighted with the hotel and services. We wanted to be near downtown but not in the city center and the Inn fit the bill to a T. The 80 room hotel sits atop First Hill, in a quiet neighborhood of historic mansions, cathedrals, medical centers and tree-lined streets. Just a few blocks walk to the city core. It looks like a boutique European hotel, brick building with a colorful awning, flower-boxes and polished brass everywhere, a cozy lobby, a great cafe for all three meals (we ate dinner there) and courtyard. The staff is more than terrific - from the desk staff to the cafe servers, its evident they enjoy working there and are great concierges for the city. The rooms are nice and are very fairly priced. The housekeeping is immaculate. The suites (we didn't stay in one but toured several) are very nice and two are on the top floor where there is an open terrace for a terrific view of the city. We'll stay in the "fireplace" suite on our next visit to Seattle. A real neat spot. Highly recommended.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126642224">We didn't realize how close this was to everything until we arrived. It was a short walk to downtown and Pikes Place. Our kids liked it so much they didn't want to leave. Most hotels are sterile, but this hotel was very homey. We felt comfortable from the start. The staff was very pleasant, the breakfast worked out great for us and we really enjoyed having Cafe Ladro right at the end of our hallway. We took a number of walks up the hill to see great views, enjoy a wonderful bakery and relax with a beer. Having a partial kitchen and dining area helped as Metropolitan Market is just down the street. Other hotels gave us the runaround because there were 5 of us staying in a room, not the Marqeen! Even with 5 people we had plenty of room and didn't feel as though we were stepping on one another. The downsides....our view was a mural on a brick wall, no airport shuttle (or shuttle of any kind) and occasionally sound from the front desk area would carry to our room at night. Overall though, this is an excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it. I just can't say enough good things about it.<topic>none</topic>

After dropping our things off we got free parking by driving a few hundred yards up the hill behind the hotel and parking on a side street. You don't need the car anyway because the hotel in close to the centre of town and walking or bus are the best options to see the sites. We'd highly recommend the Marqueen.<topic>none</topic>

This year they welcomed us back and offered a free paper that was waiting for us at 6am when we left our room. The valet driver was fast and had our car ready for us by the time we were checked out.

<comment category="positive" id="UR122892109">The beginning of a six-night trip to the Northwest began at the MarQueen Hotel in Seattle (600 Queen Ann Avenue North, Seattle 98109 â€“ 1.800.614.1750). I picked this hotel because it was close to a restaurant across the street that I wanted to try -Toulouse Petit Kitchen &amp; Lounge - and it had great ratings on the Trip Advisor. The price was excellent. The night before departure I googled the â€œstreet viewâ€� of the hotel and was filled with apprehension. It looked like a run-down neighborhood, no tall buildings and generally pretty iffy. But, it was too late to cancel and it was just for one nightâ€¦ On arrival I discovered that I was totally wrong in my first internet impressions! The hotel was an apartment house converted into hotel suites. With three floors (no elevator) and a grand double stairway, it felt like an intimate European hotel. The staff was very gracious and gave us a room on the third floor overlooking the street. Our room was actually a suite with a bedroom, a sitting room with sofa and chair, an entry hall, full kitchen and several closets. The bathroom was large and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable. The floors were hardwood with rugs and tile in the kitchen and bath. It was comfortable, clean, cozy and inviting. We unpacked and asked the front desk clerk about the restaurant across the street and got information about the history of the building and the neighborhood. I recommend this hotel highly. Itâ€™s not Mariott or Hyatt or Doubletree, itâ€™s different and fun and interesting â€“which is the whole idea in travel and having new experiences. And our dinner at Toulouse Petite was amazing!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121829486">Well, I like this sort of place. It has lots of character, visible wood, scrolly frilly decor, dramatic entrance lobby that makes you feel you've arrived at least somewhere. I didn't have too much chance to explore the neighborhood, but my local host drove me around a bit and pointed out all the great eateries and coffee shops (Seattle is pretty old school; I half-expected to hear poetry and bongos). Plus it's near the Seattle Center, with all the stuff happening there. I found the room very comfortable, and the kitchenette was terrific, with utensils, dish ware, everything exceptionally clean. I mean you could easily live here a week. Room was big, but there was no desk in the main room, just chairs and a cabinet that held an old-style CRT TV (but with a good selection of cable). Floor creaked along the entryway. Bath was fine, stocked with shampoo; water was kinda hot, or say just hot enough. Closet was a big walk-in affair. No elevator, if that matters. I'd definitely stay here again. Price was great. Accommodations quite adequate. Atmo pleasing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121474178">We loved the Marqueen. The early 1900 design was absoluetly stunning. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was good. The staff was extremely helpful in trying to find my husbands wallet after he accidently left it in a cab. They went to great lengths to help us but unfortunately were unsuccessful. It was comforting to know that strangers were still very willing to help a visitor in distress. The rooms are very large and comfortable. The hardwood floor squeaks as you walk across it, but adds to the character of the hotel. Do not stay here is you are looking for all of the modern amenities but do stay at this hotel if you are looking for a historic experience. The lobby reminded me of the Titanic with all of its grandeur. The chandliers and wood work are incredible. The continental breakffst was sufficient as we usually ate too much the evening before. The Mexican resturant across the street and the Dueling Piano bar around the corner are both a must to experience. The king size bed was very comfortable and we found the maid service was good, with only a bit of a language barrier. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel if you want an experience in a turn of the century hotel. You will not be disappointed by the friendliness of the staff and the walking distance from the Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121423051">We love the Marqueen and will stay again and again, I'm sure. This time we have a couple complaints; the tub was not clean and the fitted sheet didn't fit the bed. Also, be aware: if you don't ask for a street side room, you might feel like it's 10 p.m. in your room 24/7. We love the location (in the same building as Cafe Lladro), the valet parking, the nice staff, the cool rooms, the welcoming lobby, etc.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121134130">We stayed at the MarQueen in early November. It is just up the hill a few blocks from the Space Needle and if you walk through the park you pass through the old grounds of the Worlds Fair of 1962 called Seattle Center with the International Fountain &amp; the entrance to the Monorail which goes 1 1/2 miles to downtown to Nordstroms and other transportation such as the last stop of the metro which comes from the airport and buses. You can use the bus system to get to the Boeing Museum of Flight that is out by the SeaTac airport. It is also walkable to go down the hill to the Waterfront, Pikes Place Market, and the original Starbucks which is across the street from the market. There is a store that makes its own cheese, a number of bakeries, and fruit stands on the way down the hill. We left from one of the piers on the Clipper to Victoria to stay a few days. The Hotel is an experience in that you go back in time to an earlier day. It has quite a history. Don't expect it to be modern, but do expect comfort, cleanliness, quietness, and privacy. We did stay long enough to use the kitchen facilities but it would have been convenient. The sitting room was small but comfortable &amp; we spent time there planning our trip, using our computer to make reservations and finding information. The lobby and staircase are gorgeous and the desk help and bellhop were cheerful, friendly, helpful and informative. They can give you directions! Yes, there is no elevator but the stairs aren't that bad and they helped us carry the suitcases up. The breakfast is basic but just fine. The lady helping to set it up was very friendly. We took a couple of granola bars for the road after having morning coffee and tea. You could have bagels, oatmeal, toast, fruit, etc. There is a coffee shop/bakery next door that has more if you want it. The Mexican restaurant across the street is excellent and not overpriced. It's a "hoppin' place" on the weekends because of the bar attached and there was a line to get in. Probably quieter during the week. We stayed in the back of the hotel which was very quiet but there isn't a view since there is a painted mural brick wall in the back. The price of the hotel is a real plus since at the time we booked it was the off season but only about $135 a night. We enjoyed our experience and had wanted to stay in a historic hotel that was accessible to the sites.<topic>none</topic>

We were celebrating a birthday and they made us feel so very special. The place is nice and clean and such a surprise when you find that you have a kitchen, and sitting room included with your room of two beds. The only draw back is there is no elevator. If you are on the upper floors be prepared to take the stairs. Oh but what beautiful stairs! Walking down the stairs make you feel like you are the bride!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120250807">My husband and I were visiting our daughter for our first trip to Seattle. The room was very large. It was on the street side of the first floor and I really didn't encounter a noise problem. It had a nicely appointed kitchen and a very large bathroom It also had a sitting area with couch and easy chair that made it perfect for entertaining my daughter and her boyfriend. . the staff was excellent. Any thing we asked for was taken care of quickly and professionally. The only negative I have is the continental breakfast was nothing special. There are numerous excellent restaurants close to the hotel so that really wasn't an issue. We definitely plan on staying here again on our next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

Hardwood floors and old porcelain tubs, spacious rooms and suites, friendly and helpful staff. Not for you if want all modern cookie cutter chain rooms.

<comment category="positive" id="UR119264310">We stayed overnight and had a very good experience. This historic property was at one time a college, lodgings for factory employees and apartments. The hotel was immaculate, with a grand lobby staircase. Each "room" is really a small apartment, and I felt like Ricky and Lucy lived next door. Again, the room was spotless and the sofabed was already made up for our teenage son. All the staff was very helpful and friendly, and even printed up a map to the ferry for my husband. The area is hip with lots of great restaurants and nightlife. Would stay again in a heartbeat!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119041204">This is a very friendly small hotel in a gorgeous old building, the staff are very tuned in and helpful, and their smiles are genuine. We got a huge 2 queen room at a bargain price, kitchen and sitting area included. You could go out to eat somewhere great within a couple blocks every night for two weeks and never repeat. We too happened in on the appetizers Thursday evening from 10 Mercer- incredible fig halves on peppered crostini. Despite the busy street, the sealed windows mean its very quiet. Valet parking is easy but it was not hard to find street parking, free from 8p to 8a and then metered in 2 hour allotments. If you want to dine in, the staff will pick up your order from your choice of a couple restaurants or Cafe Ladro for a small service charge. If one had criticisms, the showers, as others have said, are ready for regrouting and recaulking, and the carpet seams in the halls are a bit threadbare in places. The breakfast is weak- but why worry with Cafe Ladro next door for espresso and pastries? We live a couple hours from Seattle and will be back for our next city getaway very soon!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118779390">What a cute hotel! We arrived at Seattle from a cruise and had not made arragements for a hotel for the day. We were tired some looked at the web to find a hotel and saw they had an offer, a last minute saving. We took a cab and arrived at this cute place, very old structure but very nice. Andrew the employee at the entrance opened the door for us and took our bags. We explained that we only needed a room for the day, because we were leaving that night very late and wanted to leave the bags and go sightseeing. Rachel, the front desk employee told us that the check in was at 3:00 pm, but found a room that was ready this early in the morning and allowed us to check in (it was around 9:30 am). The room was very clean and well maintained. This was a very old building, but everything looked clean and neat. The room had a kitchenette with amenities. We felt so comfortable that we did not wanted to go out. There were many restaurants and stores in the area. We really recommed this hotel to anyone and would like to go back and stay longer. All the employees were very nice and professional.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118041929">Our group of 4 came into town to climb Mount Rainier with Alpine Ascents Inc. and were looking for a hotel in the Queen Anne district to make logistics easier. AAI recommended The Marqueen - and they were right. A great marble slab stoop leads into this quaint 1900 era establishment. Looking around, you'd almost expect gas lighting to illuminate its curtained hallways. No Marriott cookie cutter, sterile environment here. Immerse yourself in Old town Seattle. large rooms with wooden floors, sound-proof double pane windows and kitchenettes - (fridge, sink, coffee aker and small seating area). The one immersion I could do without is the lack of elevator. However, if you are traveling light &amp; spry of step, the grand staircase is fun to bounce up and down. A nice happy hour with wine and cheese will get you in the mood to relax and socialize in this great little Queen Anne hotel. And the chilled water urn in the lobby on the sideboard is a welcome relief after arriving and checking in. Within the hotel itself is a great coffee shop (Cafe Ladro), no over roasted beans here, they open at 5am, so it made life easier since we like to rise early &amp; get rolling. On the other side of the building is a spa that we didn't have time to make it into, but it got good reviews and smelled divine. Across the street from the Marqueen are several interesting dining choices. Pesco's (Mexican - w/ sloooooooow indifferent service) &amp; Toulouse Petit (Creole). They are owned by the same people yet are as different as salt &amp; peppa. Our favorite was Toulouse Petit &amp; I recommend its HUGE french toast &amp; evening tasting menus. The Space Needle &amp; City Center are an easy walk from this lovely hotel.The staff is very helpful &amp; can recommend fun places to visit and ways to get around as you tour around the area. From hole-in-the-wall to luxury dining and local parks and hopping bars. So ask!! You'll get some great information with your preferences in mind. But walk around, check out the city - so much is to be seen in the immediate area! Enjoy!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117931990">Our family of five stayed two nights at the MarQueen and were very comfortable. We got a suite with 2 king beds and a pull out couch. The room size was enormous - it had three separate areas including a large kitchen area. The beds were luxurious, plush bathrobes in the closet were a nice touch, the front desk staff was warm and helpful, and continental breakfast was included and ample. When we travel as a family, we usually stay at a cheaper chain hotel, but the MarQueen pricing was similar and we felt like we were in a bed and breakfast. Our teenagers loved this experience and we'd definitely stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117682552">We stayed here for 6 nights on our vacation to Seattle. My husband said he felt like he stepped into another time when we entered the lobby. It is an old building that has been well taked care of. The rooms have lots of space which is great for longer stays. The staff was really helpful. I slept much better than I usually do in hotels; we didn't hear much noise from outside at all. If you are accustomed to staying in modern hotels, be aware that there are a few quirks that come with staying in an older building, such as variable water temperature in the shower and lack of counter space in the bathroom. The breakfast offerings were limited, but there is a refrigerator in the room and a few stores within walking distance, not to mention great restaurants nearby. This is a great location - many attractions are within walking distance, and there is a bus stop nearby. Overall we had a great stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117287542">We stayed three nights at the Marqueen in August. As we drove up our daughter said, "that is the ugliest hotel ever" as its boxy brick appearance is not very impressive from the outside. The inside is well cared for and the building has a subtle charm. The urban location is great, next to restaurants and an upscale food market (similar to Whole Foods) , the room kitchen very useful. We were able to easily walk to elegant residential neighborhoods, parks as well as to downtown. Hotel was clean and staff helpful and friendly. A good value and we'd absolutely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

Much of the property is converted apartments, so many of the rooms have large kitchens and sitting rooms. Wood floors, period furniture, and a somewhat quirky layout make this one of the most charming places I have stayed at. It's a short walk to Seattle Center and the Space Needle, as well as Queen Anne with its fantastic restaurants, shops, and yoga studios. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful as I bumbled through the lobby after 3 days on the mountain, with 100 lbs of wet gear. Very much felt like home.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117231891">We stayed here one night before leaving on a cruise to Alaska. The hotel has a lot of character and has a beautifully furnished lobby. Our room was quiet and spacious and even had a kitchenette. There is no elevator, but the porter was eager to carry our heavy bags upstairs and did so promptly. Everyone on the staff, actually, was eager to please. In the afternoon, wine tasting was offered in the lobby and we met another couple, newly married, who were going on the same cruise we were joining. The location of the MarQueen is ideal; the Queen Anne area of Seattle is quiet, there are many restaurants, a bus stop is across the street from the hotel, the Space Needle and convention center are within easy walking distance, and even downtown Seattle is a doable walk. If you go, do NOT miss the Metropolitan Market, a few blocks away. It is one of the best urban markets we have ever been to.<topic>none</topic>

The location is great, with easy bus access to anywhere in the city and a nice walk to downtown and Seattle Center. Easy Street Records, a great 24-hour market, and great restaurants make staying at this hotel a no-brainer!

It turned out that this location is still quiet convenient. It's away from the downtown noise but with access to all downtown points of interest by bus. We walked to the Space Needle and the Ride the Duck city tour is right next to it. We had a roomy and clean suite of 2 queen beds the comes with a seperate kitchen and a den. Great for a longer stay.

<comment category="positive" id="UR116755354">Yes, this hotel is a bit older and lacks an elevator and the quirks of being an older building, but we were very happy that we chose the Marqueen during our 4 night/5 day sightseeing of Seattle. Our room was more like a small apartment, consisting of a small kitchenette with a booth for eating, a room with our beds and a tv and a separate sitting area with a chair and a love seat. It was perfect because it allowed us to spread out a bit and really relax during the time we were in the room. The first night it was a bit loud outside and I had trouble sleeping, but that was because the temperature was such that the AC didn't run, and I'm used to sleeping with a fan... the problem was easily resolved by just turning the AC fan on for the rest of our stay. The staff was always very helpful and friendly. The one doorman in particular (which I caught his name) was great with directions and helping with bags, etc. The hotel was also in a great location-- out of downtown, but an easy walk to Seattle Center and the monorail, with lots of bus routes nearby. I'm not going to lie though, we did tons of walking-- bring your walking shoes :) Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel and would stay again, as well as recommend it. If you're expecting the Four Seasons or the Hilton, you may be disappointed. But if you're okay with some charm and have realistic expectations of a building build in 1918, Marqueen is the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116166970">We were unfortunate enough to have room 115, a ground floor room with a window looking out on a wall no more than a few feet away covered in someones idea of art or it could have been grafitti. The wall extended way, way, WAY above our room but there was probably a sky up there somewhere. Avoid the rooms that look that way at all costs. We met others who stayed there at the same time and they had a few good things to say about the hotel so we will try not to be too hard on the Marqueen. Breakfast is interesting with only 5-tables available for the entire hotel. So grab your dried muesli and take it back to your room. The hotel describes itself as 'boutique'. Where that came from is anyones guess but there is something oddly quaint about the place. Just make sure you are put in the rooms on the upper floors. One oddity. There is a tiny kitchenette but no kettle, so we aske for one. It arrived promptly but was one that had to to be placed on a cook-top (not an electric kettle). There is no cook-top! We wonder if the management have any idea why their kettles are lasting so long?<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115990924">Ten of us traveled to Seattle (where my niece lives) for a family get-together. She chose the hotel due to its proximity to her apt. We had four rooms and each was nice. Upon check-in, one of the rooms needed to be changed to include a pull-out bed (this was done expeditiously!) The staff quickly learned who we were and greeted us each time we passed the front desk. The rooms were perfect for a family gathering as each had a small kitchen and sitting area. We were able to meet for "happy hour" before dinner each evening. The decor is Queen Anne style (I think) with wingback chairs and wonderful chandeliers, wood floors and nice area rugs. The hotel is small - only three floors and does not have an elevator. The stairs are in the style of a grand staircase and my 3-year old granddaughter loved making an entrance to the lobby. The free breakfast was minimal - yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, oatmeal packets, oatmeal bars, coffee, and tea - but worked well for us as we were eating big lunches and dinners. There are many good restaurants VERY near the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115879653">Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a boutique hotel... although it bills itself as such. Rough towels, hard pillows, roly-poly mattress (bed moves sideways every time someone moves), worst breakfast we ever had in a hotel or even an inexpensive motel (plain bagels, no pastries or other bread items, cheap yogurt, instant oatmeal, no juice, whole apples, no banana or berries). Great big rooms but those in front of building don't have windows that open and some (like the one we had the first night) don't have a ceiling fan. The only way to get air movement was to run the air conditioner (very noisy and made it too cold). It was too stuffy so we asked for a portable fan. None available on site and desk clerk offered no options. We asked for the manager who was more helpful and we consented to a room switch to the back, looking at a painted brick wall but at least the window opened and it was quiet. Having a kitchen is great if you want to cook a quick meal but the Marqueen's kitchens provide no pots and pans or utensils. Only silverware, glasses and plates. Good luck! Location is good -- near Seattle Center, buses, some restaurants, foot of Queen Anne hill (good walking and views). Rooms are big and have sofas and/or chairs and decent TV. Be aware, there's no elevator but bellmen are great in hauling bags up and downstairs. Paid through Hotels.com so got a reduced rate. If paid full rate, we would have been really disappointed.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115651461">Pros: It's in a great location (the sushi restaurant around the corner is outstanding, by the way); the suite is a great size for young children, with French doors that allow for privacy after they've gone to sleep; the kitchenette is a nice feature; the daytime staff was always super friendly and helpful; the noise-reducing windows work as advertised â€” no problems at all with street sounds. Cons: In general everything is just a little old and worn (which is fine if you're looking for that); the nighttime staff was hit or miss, sometimes not even acknowledging our having entered the hotel lobby; it seems a little pricey for what you get; there are stains on the carpet in the hallways; the breakfast fare is little better than what one would get in a budget chain motel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115172705">We were only in Seattle for one night, before a cruise, so chose this for convenience. Although it is very close to the Space Needle precinct, it was too far away from downtown to walk comfortably, and staff were only variably helpful re taxis. The rooms were ok, for the price I guess. This was (I think) staff accom for a company, so the rooms are a bit larger than normal, and had a small kitchenette, which could be useful if you were staying a few days. Our first room was at the front, smelled odd, and we couldn't open the windows. The one they (very helpfully) changed us to at the back, was better re smell, with opening windows, facing straight onto a brick wall. But hey, for the price, I guess not bad.

Ours had a small sitting room, bedroom, bath, efficiency kitchen and breakfast room. The staff was terrific and the location in the Queen Anne neighborhood was excellent. An included small continental breakfast (granola bar and coffee) was a good quick bite. (Don't miss the weekday breakfast and happy hour across the street at Petit Toulouse and Pesos...awesome!) There is an entrance to Cafe Ladro (killer coffee) within the hotel, and room service is available from the cafe and two adjoining restaurants...perfect! Also, the hotel wine reception actually featured decent wines! Use the bus system for easy transport around the city. The rooms were ever so slightly down on the heel...think of it as character.

There are some interesting shops and a great supermarket (can't remember the name but is is just across the road from Easy Street Records) as well as good restaurants nearby including Ten Mercer which is attached to the hotel A short but fairly strenuous walk up hill (we took the easier option of a two minute cab ride and walk back downhill) takes you to a number of other good value eating places The staff are very helpful and friendly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR74971874">The MarQueen Hotel is The hotel in the Lower Queen Anne district. I love the area because of its bohemian up-market flair and walking distance to the Seattle Center and performing arts district. I often select hotels like the MarQueen for their unique style, history and charm. I have stayed before and had a pleasant visit. This time, when I walked into my room, I immediately went to open a window, taking advantage of the clear Seattle fresh air. Of the several windows in my room, none were functional. The windows have been covered up with a clear storm window, providing excellent insulation and noise abatement, but making it impossible to open any window. When I enquired at the front desk, I was told that all windows in the hotel had received this treatment. No where does the hotel say that they have "hermatically sealed" every window. Old, charming hotels like the MarQueen need fresh air. Otherwise, we are back to the tall highrise hotels that I avoid for this very reason. If having the window open when you sleep is an important facet of your hotel selection and stay, then, regretfully, the MarQueen is not the place. I hope management reconsiders this decision and makes a few rooms accessible to the fresh air, which Seattle has in unlimitted supply.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR74844145">A friend of ours from Seattle found this hotel for us. It is located on Queen Anne neighborhood and within walking distance of Space Needle and some of the museums nearby as well as the "Ride the Ducks". You can also take the monorail from there to downtown for $2. There is a bus that stops near the hotel. There were several good restaurants within a block or two, including a great bakery and a block away was a24 hour grocery market and a drugstore. The hotel is in an older rennovated building. The room had 2 queen beds, a kitchen with bench, a sitting area with internet connection, and a bathroom. The beds were fairly comfortable but they squeaked whenever you moved. The wooden floor also squeaked when you walked on them. It was hard for the doors not to slam shut, so you could hear other doors slam, just the way they were built. It was not a problem for us, but there is no elevator. If you have any problems with older stairs, you want to be sure to get a room on the first floor. Do not count on the continental breakfast. It was only tea and coffee with croissants and oatmeal/breakfast bars. I wouldn't even have minded having croissants, except these were not very good ones. There wasn't anything to my son's liking for breakfast, so we ended up buying cereal and milk at the market. This is a boutique motel, so there is no swimming pool, hot tub, etc. There is a nice coffee shop attached to the building. There is only valet parking, which will add to your hotel bill. I believe there is room service from nearby restaurants, but we didn't use it. If you want to stay in this location, this is a good choice. I believe there is only one other hotel in this area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR73829580">This hotel used to be an apartment building and is very old. Pro's: My room was more like a suite, with kitchen, bedroom, bath, and sitting room. Bed was comfortable. Rooms were cleaned every day. Staff was very friendly. Interesting area with many restaurants and a lot going on. Bus stop only a block away. I was not bothered by late-night noise, as some people have written they were. There is a coffee maker in the kitchen of the apartment/ room, and a full-size refrigerator. Microwave, no stove; Iron and ironing board. Free Wi-Fi. Con's: The lobby looks a little tired, and had the smell of an OLD building. There is NO ELEVATOR, and so either you need to carry your bag to the 2nd or 3rd floor, or you need the bellhop to do this. Going up and down the stairs several times each day was wearing. For many people, the hotel is perceived as charming and quaint - I saw many positive, even raving, comments in the guest book at checkout. I found it too old and drab for my taste. The breakfast was not good - croissants that looked as though they came from a discount supermarket, apples, and coffee/tea. No business center with computers, though the gracious staff are willing to print out boarding passes for guests, if that is all you need a computer for.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR71699947">We were very happy that we stayed at the Marqueen. Very large rooms, full kitchen, sitting area, great bathroom; it was a nice place to rest between out-trips. Well located near downtown, and the Queen Anne area up the hill. We stayed on the street side on a weekend night and the room was far quieter than you would expect from a city hotel on a busy street. Lots of amenities near by, which is great if you plan to use the kitchen. Old building with lots of character, but lacks an elevator. As clean as you would hope an apartment you were moving into would be, but not sterile like the downtown business hotels. Staff were consistantly helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR71691294">It is just a short cab ride to dowtown or if you can walk maybe 8 to Seattle Center and you can catch the monorail downtown. So many great restaurants within blocks, spendy or cheap. We used the grocery store just a block away to take advantage of the in room kitchen. It is a beautifully remodeled old building that is a real change from standard hotel rooms. Beds were very comfortable, just don't probably want to sleep on the pull out bed, but very comfortable, cozy sitting area. Staff was always pleasant and helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR70955377">Pros: cute neighborhood north of downtown; easy walk to Seattle Center and while not that short, pretty easy walk to downtown; historic hotel; large room , comfortable bed, more like an apartment w/a eat-in kitchen (fridg, microwave, table, no stove). Great shower. Very nice staff. Cons: We rented a suite so that my daughter could sleep on the pullout couch. My daughter is definitely NOT fussy -- she has slept in all kinds of primitive conditions--however, she could not sleep on the couch-- when we opened it up the mattress was extremely thin, flimsy--not something you could sleep on-- also, the sheets we were provided did not fit on the bed. In conclusion, if you stay at the Marqueen and don't need to use a pullout couch (or don't get a suite -- just get a room with a bed) you'll like it a lot--- but if you need a separate sleeping space for another person (child, whatever) rent two rooms or go elsewhere. Another con-- the breakfast needs improvement. Could be easily improved by supplying milk for coffee and warm (not just out of the freezer) croissants. Also, since fresh fruit is readily available in Seattle, adding fruit would be a plus.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR65294814">I live in Tacoma and stayed at the MarQueen Hotel last Saturday. I was in town to see some Rock-N-Roll in Ballard. We arrived to the hotel and had our vehicle parked by the Valet. It was so easy and fuss-less. There are so many options for dining out in the immediate area, we had dinner a couple of blocks away at Bamboo Gardens (vegetarian Chinese, delicious). The MarQueen is by far my new favorite place to stay in Seattle! The room we had was completely sound proof from the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood below. The best part of our stay, besides the very friendly service, was the bed. I wish I could have that good of a night's sleep every night. I got home and wanted to burn my bed and permanently move into the room I had at the MarQueen.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR60047310">we stayed for 1 week and enjoyed the historic hotel and bohemian surroundings. the front staff were helpful and friendly yet professional. there are good restaurants in the area and queen anne street provided a nice, albeit short, stroll. i skipped breakfast because there was little to offer (cold croissants with jam and butter, coffee, tea, some fruit and breakfast bars) and the fitness center was rudimentary. the parking was costly at $20 per night with no other options (plus tip each time you take out your car and return it). also there are no elevators. but we had no problems with street noise and i liked the kitchenette which was convenient so overall, a good choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR55476036">My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in early February in a lovely third floor room. The room was quiet and quite large, with a comfortable bed, sitting area and kitchenette (full size refrigerator, microwave, dining table). Everything was well maintained. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcome, and were willing to assist with every request - extra glassware, directions, baggage assitance, theater tickets, etc. The location was great; many nearby restaurants plus drug &amp; grocery stores. Easy walk, bus ride or quick cab to downtown area. Very close to the Seattle Center. There is a very nice wine and appetizer reception mid-week. A few caveats: Another couple traveling with us had a room on the street side of the hotel and had quite a bit of street noise from a local bar/club on the weekend. The breakfast buffet had a very limited selection. There is no elevator.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR50778278">The marqueen is listed as a three star hotel and I was really disappointed when we arrived. It is really old and outdated, I suppose some would find that quaint but it was loud and musty smelling. The carpets in the hallway were badly stained. The floors in the room were wood but pretty old. The bathroom was tiny and the flooring was this old, ratty linoleum. I was afraid to walk in the room with bare feet. I had seen where previous reviews mentioned how loud it was outside the hotel. It was awful. There are a couple of bars across the street and due to the pumping music and loud voices, it felt like the bar was in my room. Combined with the traffic on the street, the noise was unbearable. After the first night, I asked if we could switch rooms to the inside section of the hotel. The staff did not seem at all surprised by my request but said there were no other rooms to switch to. I get the feeling that it is a common request. I got stuck with this hotel by using Priceline. If you are using Priceline to find a hotel near dowtown Seattle, stay away from Queen Ann or you will get stuck with the Marqueen. Lake union is a much better bet. Nothing in this hotel is nice, new, comfortable, or clean<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR49057293">We stayed at the MarQueen hotel for approx. 6 days. It was very clean and also in a great location. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and arranged a few restaurant reservations and a day trip for us to BC. The room had a huge kitchen with sitting area and a separate mini-living room area. The hotel is within a short walk to the space needle and in an area that has a lot of good restaurants, shopping, etc. There is also a restaurant, spa and coffee shop in the same building. I would love to stay there again if we get back to Seattle in the future.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR45870153">I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my partner in september. This hotel is beautiful its an old house which has been converted but has kept so much of its original charm and beauty. When we arrived the receptionist was great she gave us a map and due to the short period of time we where going to be in the city she helped us chose things that we should definately try to see and the quickest and best way to fit them all in. The hotel has a free shuttle service to and from certain tourist attractions and areas which is really handy. The hotel is within walking distance of the harbour, the space needle and pike market. The room we had was huge and had a kitchen area and a small sitting area and a reasonable sized bathroom. The hotel was really clean and although it was full on the days we were there it was really quiet. I loved this hotel and hope to get back to seattle for a longer length of time in the near future and will definately look to stay in this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32778471">Our family stayed 3 nights in June, 2009 and we got a great deal with internet specials that were much lower than the rates offered by calling the hotel. Our 2 rooms on the 2nd floor were spacious, well appointed, and the special experimental windows in one of our rooms significantly reduced the noise from the busy street below. Several of Seattleâ€™s finest theaters are within easy walking distance, as are Seattle Center with the Space Needle and the Music Experience. So if you are planning to stay more than one night to enjoy the areaâ€™s attractions, it would be well worth the effort to check out public transportation and the hotel shuttle schedule to perhaps avoid the cost of bringing a car. Parking expenses can mount quickly. We paid over $40 on a single day that included shopping, touring, dining and the hotelâ€™s valet service. There is no elevator in the hotel. However the valet-bell man was quick to move our luggage up and down the stairs as needed. The wireless internet worked well most of the time and there are numerous outlets throughout the rooms. The temperature was easy to set and quick to adjust. Our rooms had kitchens with in-room coffee, refrigerators, sinks, microwaves and tables. Water pressure was reasonable and the shower-bathtub faucets, easy to work. Every few days, the hotel hosts a late afternoon wine and hors dâ€™oeurves reception that includes some very tasty local foods. The continental breakfast is limited, but satisfactory - consisting of yogurt, orange juice, various breads, apples and coffee. There are a number of restaurants, coffee shops and a large grocery store within a short walking distance of the hotel. The front desk staff is very helpful, but the housekeeping service is not thorough or consistent. Our sonâ€™s room was not made up until very late in the afternoons, conflicting with the time they wanted to dress for evening activities. Management apologized and made an adjustment to our bill at the time we checked out, which is always appreciated. To be fair, we should have brought this to someoneâ€™s attention after the first incident, but we did not expect it to happen twice. If you plan to stay at the Marqueen, be sure to check internet hotel search sites for special rates, leave the â€œplease make up roomâ€� tag on the door, and let the maid know when you expect to return to the room. Also, check out the public transportation options.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32382230">We had a comfortable mini-suite, including a full kitchen, for much less than we would expect to pay for a location within walking distance of the Seattle Center. Two nice grocery stores were within a block. The staff was extremely helpful, assisting us in arranging a day trip to Mt. Rainier and a city tour. The breakfast (included) was not the best--stale pastries in a crowded room--and the on-premises parking was pricey ($20 a day). But these are small complaints for a really charming place.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26762061">We've previously stayed at "historic boutique" hotels before and have been disappointed. However, the MarQueen definitely exceeded our highest expectations! The history behind the hotel is very interesting, and photos with detailed captions describing the history are located throughout the hotel. The staff was helpful, friendly, and attentive. The newly added continental breakfast was delicious, especially the coffee! And the rooms were the best!!! Loved the decor, large comfy bed, full kitchen (with dishes and utensils), and lots of room! Also enjoyed the hotel-provided shampoo, conditioner, lotion, oatmeal soap, and aromotherapy patches to assist in a restful night's sleep. The location was great, too! Within blocks of the Space Needle and a short drive to downtown Seattle. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26559192">This venerable brick building served originally (in the early 1900s) as household quarters for automobile mechanics. There were other uses before its renovation as a hotel. Excellent value on Priceline: about $60 (vs current $149, less 10% AAA). Old building, wood floors creaky on occasion if you care. Occasional "bumps" perhaps in plumbing. Downsides: expensive ($20 valet-only / but secure, off-street) parking. Other reviewers complain of street noise but my room faced on Queen Anne Avenue at ground level and I experienced no disturbing noise. Earplugs and heavy drapes provided. No elevators; bell staff will help you to upper-floor (or to any) rooms, or ask for a first-floor room. Upsides: easy access to public transportation; a free scheduled shuttle to Pike Market, downtown/Westlake, Convention Center, Ferry Teminal; walk to Seattle Center/OperaHouse/Space Needle/Theatres. Safeway, Starbucks, Bank of America and many restaurants within two blocks. Very spacious well-lighted rooms (I estimate 750 sq ft, with large living/bedroom, ample kitchen/dining/work area, sizable bathroom, walk-in closet with terry robes); king beds, sofa, big TV, nice bathroom linens and unusual amenities, a kitchen area with dishes andflatware, apartment refrigerator, coffee maker and coffee, microwave, sink, charming decor. Easy working temperature adjustment. Friendly staff. Guest laundry in sister hotel (Inn at Queen Anne), 2 blocks. Flawless free wireless (about 1/5 of home high-speed, depends on user traffic and probably slower in summer) but ample for me). Generous included continental breakfast, generous hours. Newspaper at door each morning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR23843432">This hotel is quite deceiving. Visit their website, read their literature, even walk into their lobby, and you'll believe that you are in for a treat... though quickly you'll be terribly disappointed. It wasn't long after check in that I needed some ice. After roaming the halls and not finding an ice machine I call the front desk, only to find that there is no self serve ice machine... ok, I could live with that, but waiting for it to be delivered (30 minutes later) was not okay. Next up, I decide to take advantage of their shuttle service... of course that is not as advertised- it must be arranged 24 hours in advance and only stops at a few locations at fixed times throughout the day! Inconvenient and impractical. Ask the front desk for directions, tourist advice, ANYTHING, and you're confronted with a whole lot of Uhhhh's and hmmmm's. Not helpful! All of this I could deal with, but the clincher came when the "free wi-fi in every room" wasn't working in our room. I went to the front desk and told an (overwhelming) blond agent my problem, and she said that the wi-fi was complimentary and thus not guaranteed. When I pressed the issue, she said she'd talk to the manager, but as I walked away she said some incredibly rude and degrading things about me!!! Of course, I was eventually contacted by a manager who said there was nothing she could do about the internet, but when I told her what the front desk agent had said,she said I must have misheard!!! Urgh... I've never been confronted with such an overall lack of professionalism and ineptitude in all of my travels. There must be better places to stay in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21159459">In a city full of over-priced hotels, pretentious venues and expensive parking, my wife and I have struggled to find a reasonable place to stay for our occasional trips from Eastern Washington. This hotel was a nice surprise. It is an old and partially renovated apartment building (I say partially, because the vault of the rooms are basically untouched beyond paint, the floors need a good polish and kitchens are not updated) with pleasant and tasteful decor. Our room had a fairly new Queen Anne (?) style bedroom set and a nice small sitting area, but really could not escape the feeling of just being old. The advantages are clear: it is a good value if you can get a room in the lower $100's (the rack rates are not a great value), it is walking distance to a number of theaters, activities and neighborhood restaurants, the kitchen is a nice plus (so you can stay in a hotel and box your unfinished dinner), street parking is available in an area that is not so seedy that you don't get over the initial nerves and the rooms are pretty comfortable if you can get past the lack of updated trimmings. By the way, our doorman was unusually attentive. Maybe someone reads these reviews... ;-)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20481895">As many other travelers have noted, this is a beautiful old building (actually a former apartment building) on the fringe of downtown Seattle. The hotel is located at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, a lively commercial and nightspot area. The building itself has a lot of potential. It was built around the turn of the 20th century, and is loaded with "Old World Charm", as they say. The owners have tried - rightly - to capitalize on this heritage, with historic photos on the wall, and Victorian-style potted palms and plants in oversized urns. There are lovely oriental carpets and the rooms are large- - they are really "single" apartments (size-wise they are between a one bedroom and a studio). So what's the problem? There are a few, actually. We noted that the management has TRIED to capitalize on the historic nature of the building, but they have come up a bit short. To wit: The aforementioned potted plants? Fake. The oriental carpets (and the rest of the carpeting, for that matter) were tired and dingy. Not filthy, but dowdy. The red carpet (a nice touch) on the marble steps at the main entrance was marred by two crushed cork-tipped cigarette butts on the night we arrived. These details belie a standard of cleanliness and care that is noticeably below par. The place aims to be your glamorous old aunt but actually comes off a bit dowdy. The old girl needs a good scrubbing and some TLC. Then there is the matter of service. We have stayed at the Marqueen three times, and the service has been uneven. Sometimes very good, but more often simply lackadaisical, and occasionally surly. (Open note to management: An establishment that employs a "doorman" should instruct that person to OPEN THE DOOR for people as they approach, and not merely watch as patrons struggle to do so on their own). One gets the impression that these problems -- irritating though they may be -- are not insurmountable. Nothing that a visit to the beauty parlor for the building, and a refresher course in boardinghouse manners for the staff couldn't cure.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20380186">My family and I stayed at the Marqueen in early September, and we were thrilled with the lovely charm and ambience of the hotel. It felt more like our own little apartment room rather than a plain hotel room. My wife especially loved the little 'sitting room' area. There was a nice little kitchenette in our room, but please be warned that there are little or no utensils in order to cook anything more than a very simple packet meal. We are used to self contained rooms in most hotels including mixing bowls, can openers, cork removers, olive oil and other basics, but you don't get any of that here. Nevertheless, there are a couple of great supermarkets only a block away which can supply these and lots of great ingredients to cook. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Seattle Center and Space Needle. We stayed here for nearly 2 weeks, and had absolutely no noise problems from the surrounding bars or other rooms. We were on the second floor facing at the back of the hotel. Definitely a highly recommended property, and we would stay there again if ever in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20199346">The pictures online tell a different story.. The Lobby area was nice, as were the staff. There is no ice in the rooms or in a self serve location. I had to call room service for ice, and after 20 miniutes I went down to the desk and got it myself. Very dissapointed in the room, old and dumpy! The plummbing is not much better. Their restaurant is across the street, if you want room service from there it's 20% service charge + 18% gratuity???? Oh! and to park your car, it's $20.00 per night. My room was right across the street from a bar/restaurant that was noisy all night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17384338">When people ask if we will stay at this hotel again, I would say yes. Just be more careful which room to be in. I stayed at MarQueen for 4 nights for business trip. Although some of the review was mentioning about noise, we thought having a spacious comfortable room was important. When we arrived, there were one couple before us, and they were asked if they prefer quiet room. They took the quiet room on 3rd floor. When we were checking in, the front desk person did not ask our preference... I just let it go, and took the room she gave us. Which turned out to be the direct across the noisy bar on 2nd floor room 204. It wasn't very noisy when we checked in around 4 pm. It was Wed. The noise from the bar started around 9 pm and ended around 2:30 am. Even though the window was shut, it could still hear the screaming guys and gals smoking outside the bar. I believe the hotel knew the noise problem from the bar, because there were set of ear plugs in the snack basket for the guest. We had to use ear plugs for the night. It was still weekday, I could not imagine how noisy the weekend will be!!! Next morning we changed to quiet room on 3rd floor facing backside of the building. Rest of the stay was wonderful. It is a funny thing... although we had loud noise problem, I still think staying at this hotel gave us sense of living in seattle. And we loved it. Maybe because the hotel is kind like an apartment, you feel like living there. Having a kitchen and dining area was very nice. It was very nice to have separate living area with sofa and coffee table. One more thing... if you have a car, parking around the hotel will be tough! There are a lot of restriction for street parking. You should expect to pay $20 per day for valet parking at hotel. You will be able to take car in and out through out the day. but you also pay tip to valet parker. When I went to downtown to meet my husband, I walked to monorail just about 10 min nice walk from the hotel. Once you take monorail, it only takes 2 min to get to Westlake Shopping Center which is the center of downtown. If you decided to stay at MarQueen, avoid room on 2nd floor facing the street. If you want to have quiet room, ask for 3rd floor facing the back side of the building. You will have a little bit of the space needle in view from the window. I noticed that 2nd floor facing back has no view at all. They are looking at wall of next building which is very sad...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16706815">This hotel is lovely and in a great location. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The desk and service personnel are knowledgeable and helpful without fail EXCEPT in one very important area: The only problem, and it was a major one for me, was that they refused to take our party of eight (we booked four rooms) to the Pier to meet our cruise. One of the main reasons we booked with this hotel was because of the transportation to the Pier. We were told that we could not monopolize the transportation (?) but no explanation was given as to why four couples could not be provided transportation. Evidently if we'd been four separate couples taking the same cruise but not acquainted they would have had no problem. We managed to find transportation at a very significant cost. The day we left, after moving our bags to the lobby and after our transportation arrived I inquired again as to their policy....and was told I had been given incorrect information and they would have taken us. Strange...as they refused to schedule us but then said they would have taken us if we were scheduled. Overall this is a good place to stay, but beware of transportation promises, it may not be there when you need it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR11014547">The room was very spacious, and had a charming, vintage feel. There was no elevator, which we didn't realize when we booked, so it was kind of a drag climbing the stairs with bags, but the exercise was good for us! There's a very good (and sometimes busy) coffee shop next door, accessible through the lobby, which was a nice convenience. I liked the area very much, kind of off the main tourist track, with some cute restaurants and shops nearby. Drawbacks were lack of onsite parking--we had to wait for the valet to retrieve the car each time we needed it--and no wi-fi--it took one of the staff many trips to figure out how to connect our laptop to the internet with the ethernet cable they supplied. Overall, I liked the Marqueen, and would recommend it for someone who likes something different and a bit funky.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10930608">I was in Seattle for work and wanted to find a good value compared to the expensive conference hotels downtown. The Marqueen provides good value and is more of a European style hotel, except the rooms are actually more like large studio apartments including a kitchenette, large bath and walk-in closet. The bed and linens were comfortable and the hotel is located in lower Queen Anne in close proximity to some great bars and restaurants, but it is not walking distance to downtown and public transportation options are limited. There is a great coffee shop attached to the hotel and but no restaurant -- no need in this area of the city. This hotel is for a particular type of client. If you are looking for a Sheraton or Holiday Inn, this is not your type of place. If you want a friendly and home-like atmosphere with lots of room to rest your weary body -- then this is your place. PS Noticed no particular musty smells in the lobby or the room and I am usually VERY sensitive to these things.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10351868">Spent a week in Seattle staying at the Marqueen, handy for the Seattle Centre and Space Needle and only a monorail ride or quick bus trip to the heart of downtown with plenty of bars and restuarants in the area if you want to eat locally. Rooms are big and come with a fully equipped kitchen and mine was comfortable and clean. Plumbing was rather antiquated but eveything worked which was the important thing. Front desk staff were attentive and helpful and happy to provide advice and guidance on local amenities. If you're a light sleeper I suggest you ask for a room at the rear, my room was at the front as the proximity of the main road and bars and restaurants means some late night noise, particularly at the weekend. It didn't stop me getting a good nights sleep, more of an issue was the noise from the fridge in the kitchen which I found it best to turn off overnight. Overall, I'd be happy to stay again at this well-appointed and individual hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8721140">I read all the reviews, but questioned if they were "planted" or for real. Well, they were for real. Everything we asked for was taken care of immediatly. It was as if the desk staff knew what we wanted before asking. Loved the room, especially the kitchen and small reading/parlor. Robes were provided as well as coffee and tea. We did some shopping at the market down the street which saved us a few dollars on food but don't miss Peco's restaurant across the street. They have a Happy Hour breakfast between 9:00am and 11:am with just about anything on the menu for $6.00. Lots of other dining options within a few short blocks.

The MarQueen is a beautiful period hotel with lots of original features. The staff are really helpful and there was a free wine reception the first night we were there. Our room was large and very comfortable. The kitchen area is great , there's air con, TV, WIFI, a seperate sitting area etc. We also found it to be a great location for exploring Seattle - great restraunts right opposite and walking distance to the Space Needle. Compared to other hotels in Seattle - very good value too!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8456043">My husband and I chose the Marqueen as our wedding hotel in July. After talking with almost every other hotel in seattle, the Marqueen had the best rates for the rooms/amenities (they also run a stay 3 nights, get the 4th free- check out their website for these deals!), excellent location and were amazingly easy to work with. They offered us a small block of rooms without needing a guaranteed %, and being a detail fanatic, I went back and forth with the guest service manager MANY times and he was always super nice. They also left us a bottle of champagne in our room the night of our wedding! Very thoughtful. The rooms are like small apartments- the pictures posted by previous guests are very accurate and we also stayed in room 202 (has a nice view out the front of the hotel onto 1st?). They have a small kitchenette, built in dining space, huge bedroom and a small sitting room. We used 202 as the brides getting ready room, and it housed all the people and comer/goers without ever feeling crammed. The marqueen itself is an older building with great architecture and light, so we also took our 'first sight' pictures here before we headed off to the wedding as bride/groom. What I like most about hotels, once they have the basics down (large room, clean, internet, etc) is the service. And with a bellman to help you the second your car pulls up, and who opens/closes the front doors for you every time you arrive, and the front desk who were very nice... the marqueen adds the extra touch you're looking for! Esp during your wedding weekend. Other details: - Only drawback (for some, but I didnt think so) is that they dont serve breakfast. But you have a kitchenette or Pesos across the street has very yummy breakfasts! - Very close to multiple restaurants on lower queen anne, 2 large grocery stores, a Kits Camera (which came in handy), dry cleaners, Kinkos and 2 starbucks- all within a 4 block radius of the marqueen. - Super clean rooms and the maids were really good about not disturbing all our wedding stuff, yet still organizing the room during service. - They have a downtown shuttle which was awesome (fyi- the marriott on lake union doesnt have a shuttle- we had some guests staying there and overall, were disappointed). - Parking was easy, although we valeted with the hotel most of the time for minimally more. - FREE internet, which also worked well/fast! Hooray. * I didnt notice an elevator for older guests or handicapped, although there might have been one. But they do have rooms on the first floor. Overall, 5 stars and we highly recommend the Marqueen! Enjoy. (I havnt added our own pics, as room 202 was already posted by another reviewer, and we were quite messy in our room! But their pictures are very good and truly show the room as we had it as well)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8442349">We stayed at the MarQueen hotel for just one night &amp; it was wonderful. Previous reviews mentioned the noise from the front of the hotel so I requested a room on the 3rd floor at the back and it was very quiet. It was a 5 minute walk to the Seattle Rep Theater, with lots of restaurants to choose from along the way. Our room was quite large with hardwood floors, crown molding &amp; no musty smell whatsoever. The room and the hotel overall was very clean and beautiful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8418347">I enjoyed my stay at the MarQueen immensely, the reception staff were very polite, professional and helpful. The ambience and scented smell of the reception gave it a very welcoming, warm and homely feel. I stayed in 201 and was right by staircase on first flr so luggage wasnt a problem despite no elevators. Noise from Pesos bar/restaurant outside and Queen Anne avenue was quite excessive, but this was no problem with windows shut. Appreciated opening windows to air con, although AC was quite loud. Bathroom was good, kitchen &amp; breakfast area was large. Microwave, large fridge and coffee machine. No washing liquid and tea towels made using kitchen difficult but appreciated kitchen towels. 10/15 minutes walk from Space Needle. Local Safeway was convenient too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8248091">This hotel has great service, and most rooms have a full kitchen which was great since there is no breakfast at the hotel. Across the street, Pesos, serves great breakfasts for $6 M-F. Pesos is also a great night spot every night of the week, so if you go to sleep early, don't get a room on Queen Anne. Up the hill on Queen Anne is a great area for breakfast and shopping boutiques. The hotel is also on the 18 bus route, which takes you to Belltown, Ballard and downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8024950">At first I was a little hesitant about staying at the hotel. The hotel itself is fine, but the people at the bar outside can be a little loud. In retrospect, I am so glad I chose to stay. This hotel has some of the nicest front desk people I have ever met. One person, Kris, in particular was fantastic. He always greeted us when we passed by. Even if it was 3 or 4 times in 15 minutes. He was personable and professional and always had a smile on his face. Each night when we walked through the lobby he offered to set up a wake up call for us, instead of waiting for us to ask for one. The rest of the staff was just as good. Plus the location is perfect. Try to get a quiet room because of the noise from accross the street, but if one isn't available, remember that the bar closes at 2am, so it should be quiet after that. I highly recommend you stay at the Mar Queen Hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7939990">The Marqueen is in an old building with a long and illustrious history. At various times it's been a Ford worker complex (turn of the century), an apartment building and an opium den. : ) Now it has been restored as a old world feel hotel which definitely lacks the lustre and shine of the new and the modern but still has it's charm. The suites are spacious with tall ceilings, original hardwood floors, new bathrooms and original kitchens with massive cupboards. Not all the suites are flawless - some still have carpeting over the hardwood for instance, and there is some must in the air, but it's not unexpected or bad, and the work is not finished. The furnishings have an antique feel to them, there is free wi-fi, robes and the best, most helpful staff I have ever seen. They were truly outstanding ensuring the stay was a great experience. You can't beat the value for the price for a downtown Seattle hotel. All the great things downtown are within walking distance and the one cab ride we felt was required was only ten dollars. If you're not the kind of person to be put off by an older feeling room it's great value, but if you need shiny surfaces and modern furnishings this is not the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7570139">We used the Marqueen and its sister hotel the Inn at Queen Anne as recommendations for our out-of-town guests at our October 2006 wedding. Our bridal party also stayed here, and my husband and I stayed in one of the large suites they use as the bridal suite. The Marqueen is very charming, with an old world feel, and extremely affordable (with or without a wedding discount). We loved the furnishings and the design of the rooms. And the price was just unbeatable! The whole staff was super nice as well. Also Queen Anne is an ideal neighborhood if you are visiting Seattle, cute and charming with easy access to Seattle Center and Downtown. Everyone we spoke to in our wedding party had a good experience there. The suite we stayed in was huge and beautiful, with a kitchenette, eating area, living room, and huge bed. If you are looking to block rooms for a wedding at an affordable place in Seattle, the good people at the Marqueen are a joy to work with. And if you are just looking for an affordable hotel in a great neighborhood, something more interested than the holiday inn, this is a fantastic choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7238305">I stayed at the MarQueen for business the week of March 19th. Positives: As noted by other reviewers, the room was large, including a kitchenette, large sleeping area, walk-in closet and average sized bathroom. The service was excellent: attentive and efficient. And, the hotel itself is in a good location, with lots of restaurants nearby, and it is just a couple of blocks to attractions like the Space Needle, Key Arena, and others. Negatives: Again as noted by other reviewers, the place smells. A musty, stale, smell hangs over the lobby, and exists throughout the hotel. The lobby itself has a run-down look, as did my room. Threadbare rugs on floors, worn hardwood, all the polish off the bathtub, bathroom floor tile in desperate need of re-grouting, worn doorhandles, creaky floors....the list goes on. I get that the motif is going for a jazz age atmosphere, but I've been in hotels that manage character without looking, feeling, and smelling worn. Warnings: A couple of things didn't bother me, but might put off other travellers. First, there's no elevator (the hotel has only 3 floors). Second, my room at the front of the hotel was subject to a good deal of street noise: the street outside seems a busy thoroughfare for cars, and the restaurants/night spots seemed to spit out handfuls of loud (but not rowdy) crowds each night. Not overbearing noise, but noticeable. Booking through Expedia cost me about $160/night. Not expensive for the location, but given that there were other hotels nearby also in that price range, I have a feeling there's a better option in the neighbourhood than the MarQueen.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6941605">My husband, teenage son and I stayed here over the weekend as the boys were going to a Sonics game. They were able to walk a few blocks to the Key Arena. The valets were excellent! Best service we have ever seen. They opened doors, carried baggage, parked our car, and generally hopped to our every need. Parking is $18 per night, but that is reasonable for a Seattle city hotel. Once you step into the lobby of the MarQueen, you know it's old. It's got beautiful wood floors, large chandeliers, velvet drapes and antique furniture. Our room was much of the same... polished, creaky wooden floors; a long kitchen with a booth to eat breakfast and a full refrigerator/microwave; a small living room with a loveseat and recliner; and comfy beds. There was also loads of Seattle Magazines on the coffee table. We found great places to see and eat at in those magazines. I used the monorail to get to the downtown shopping area. You can also ride the bus or take a taxi. Parking is terrible downtown. The hotel has a car that will take you places as well. (they don't promise they can pick you up however). Cafe Ladro (next door) has the Best soy latte I have ever had. They also have pies, quiche, muffins and soup. If you like brand new hotels ...then this one won't be for you. If you are like me and appreciate the character and history of these older hotels, then try the MarQueen. We'll be going back!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6837766">I have stayed in different hotels (ranging from the great to terrible) in Seattle over the last 25 years. This one is memorable for the following reasons: -TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME: It was built in the early 20th century (1917?) and retains some of the charm from those early days. Photos of early Seattle and its leaders line the hallways. Some of the floors are creaky, but to me that just adds to the ambiance of an old hotel. The room we stayed in had a small kitchen and living room area, and could have been someone's apartment in years past. -LOCATION PART 1: You are within walking distance to Key Arena. You don't have to fight traffic going home from a Sonics game or a concert. You can go to the Space Needle and eat at some pretty decent restaurants in the area. -LOCATION PART 2: Kerry Park. This is close to the hotel, and the best site in town for photographing the Emerald City. When you see the postcards of Seattle, this is where many of those shots are taken. It's on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill, located at the corner of 2nd Avenue W. and W. Highland Drive. -PRICE: For Seattle, the price is a bargain. The only negative thing that stands out is the parking. You can drive around the block again and again and possibly find a space, but I suspect it may be easier to take advantage of the valet.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123747680">My daughter and I bought a promotional package for 2 nights at this hotel that included breakfast and valet service. Our goal was to do a bit of shopping, rest, and go out for drinks and dinner. The location enabled us to do just that. Breakfast was great, as was the valet service. The hotel was quiet and elegant. Our room was fine but needed a bit of updating. The only disappointment was at Oliver's. We decided to go for a drink at Oliver's since it is so famous for martinis. Both the martini and the gin and tonic we ordered were very small and neither of us tasted any gin at all. My daughter had visited the lounge before and she said they loved the drinks here then. It was a relaxing and fun trip and we would return if a promotional package came along.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123219428">Remember Eloise, the little girl in the children's books who lived in the Plaza Hotel in New York? Well, I wish that was me, and I wish the hotel were the Mayflower Park. I was in Seattle for a ginormous conference in the Conference Center; I was avoiding sprawling conference sites like the plague. I wanted peace. Elegance. Beauty. Quiet. All that I got at the Mayflower. Andrew S.in reservations handled my complicated reservation without blinking. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. The hotel is quaint, elegant, not too big (12 floors), next to Nordstrom flagship store, short walk to Pike Place, about 10 minutes from the convention center... what's not to love? Plus that, I am pretty neurotic when it comes to sound, but the hotel was really very quiet, with minimal street noise. Oh, and Andalucca--a first rate Mediterranean restaurant is on the first floor. After the conference, my oldest friend (from grade three) drove down from Vancouver to spend a day visiting with me, and she found the hotel every bit as perfect. Thank you, Mayflower, for a truly wonderful stay. It was heaven.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123114176">Right in the middle of downtown, the buses, trolley, monorail and light rail are all accessible, and they have valet parking for those who need their own transportation. It is an older hotel that has been lovingly kept up, retaining its beauty, charm and identity, yet has incorporated the modern conveniences where you would wish them. Staff are knowledgeable and pleasant, The beds are comfortable. Although near everything, it is quiet. If you prefer to avoid the sterile 'bed in a box' of many hotels and crave a sense of history and identity, this is the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123072658">I have stayed at the Mayflower Park 4 times for business purposes. The location is very good for business or pleasure, being right between Macy's and the flagship Nordstrom store. It is 4 blocks from Purple Cafe (wine bar), a block from Lola (the donuts!), and very close to many other great downtown spots. Valet parking ONLY. Oliver's (the in-hotel bar) might look stuffy, but the staff are friendly and the drinks are top class. Food is generally tasty. Be sure to try several of the specialty martinis, including the Paradigm Shift (vodka, raspberry, champagne, campari). The "well" gin is Bombay Sapphire. If you need a cup of joe and are tired of the Starbucks routine (a huge location is a block away - a big glass walled building on a bustling corner), you can head 2 blocks down to Caffe Senso Unico, a coffee shop run by an Italian family. BEST value in downtown Seattle with FREE wifi. The ONE negative I can cite is that the building is on a busy corner, so if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for an inside room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122829974">We were so lucky to attend a wedding on New Year's Eve at the Mayflower. Everything was wonderful from the moment we stepped out of the car in valet. They recognized the bride and everyone from valets to the front desk to waiters made sure to congratulate her. The front desk was very helpful with our early check-in requests too. I wish that I could remember names of the fabulous people who helped us! Kim at Oliver's was amazing and Andrew from events was great. The only issue that we had in our 4 day stay was a snippy comment from a 20-something staff member (he could have been a waiter?) that we stopped in the lobby. He told us that "it wasn't his department" when we asked for help with the temperature of the banquet room. The front desk jumped to the rescue and fixed the problem quickly. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122796112">At the last minute, my boyfriend and I realized that staying downtown on New Years Eve after dining and hearing music was a way good idea. We recalled staying at the Mayflower about 6 months earlier, when we were drawn to its old world charm and vintage surroundings. We got lucky and scored a Queen sized room on the 11th floor, standard, but well-appointed, with space used wisely, affording us a great view of both a lively neighborhood and the skyline. Last time we were there, my bf got an amazing upgrade to suite, and it was the cats meow; huge, tons of windows. Bed is comfy, bathroom is great. Location is several blocks away from Pike Place Market if you are touring, but as a local, I love this place for its romantic atmosphere as well. Highly recommend!<topic>none</topic>

The rooms are old world spacious, clean, and up to date classic all rolled into one. Oliver's is the place to ring in the new year with classic cocktails remeniscent of a black and white movie with service to match.

<comment category="positive" id="UR122553935">My girlfriend and I are from the area, but we wanted to do something special for NYE, and after a little searching around, I came across the Mayflower Park's New Year's special. It was a good deal for a one night stay, and late check out on New Years Day was WONDERFUL. The room was definitely on the small side, if we had been staying more than one night it might've been a problem, but for one night it was fine. The valet staff were super friendly. The only real complaint I had was the price of the room service. I've stayed in PLENTY of hotels with pricey room service, but $5 for one glass of orange juice at breakfast? Seriously? I love Andaluca's food, but that's just absurd. I didn't want to spoil a romantic breakfast in bed starting off the new year, so I paid it anyway, but come on. I was also a little disheartened to learn that although the website advertises views of the space needle, a condo building has gone up in recent years that blocks the view from all but two rooms, which put a dent in some of our romantic weekend plans - we wanted to watch the fireworks from seattle center at midnight! I specifically requested a room with a view when I made our reservation but didn't learn about this until check-in.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121271474">We have made a point of visiting Seattle yearly, for the past three years during the "Black Friday" weekend. Besides the obvious reason - great shopping bargains! - we return to Seattle because it is an attractive city easily reached by car from our home in BC, Canada. For the past few years, after trying other hotels, we have stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel. We especially enjoy the Mayflower's room rates, central location, friendly &amp; helpful staff, tasteful ambiance, lounge (Oliver's) and restaurant (the Andaluca). When we arrive on Black Fridays, the lobby and Olivers are abuzz with a happy crowd enjoying hot chocolate, home made cookies and drinks awaiting the lighting of the Christmas tree at Westlake Centre, next to the Mayflower, followed by Macy's roof top fire works across the street. Although we have had a room with a view onto the fire works, we always choose to join the outdoor crowds and enjoy the happy atmosphere - a good start to the Christmas season. Upon arrival at the hotel, we park our car and leave it parked for the weekend as everything we want to see/visit is within easy walking distance. Seattle has a wonderful selection of restaurants, interesting neighbourhoods, good shopping and, of course, the always entertaining Pike Place Market. Our stay in the lovely Mayflower, which always includes breakfasts in the Andaluca, adds to our enjoyment of Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121223800">I can't say enough about the service at the Mayflower Park. I seriously doubt if I will ever stay anywhere else in Seattle. Kelly at the front desk went above and beyond to help us when we stranded ourselves in Fremont. We went to see a play at a little theater not realizing that it was a bit out in the sticks. We tried to call the cab company that took us there but got NO ANSWER. So we called the Mayflower and Kelly sent another cab company for us, tout suite! Then, the morning of our departure, we asked for directions to catch the light rail to the airport. We were a little confused so one of the clerks said he needed a walk anyway and he walked us to the corner! Incredible service in this day and age! The hotel is also beautifully appointed and in an ideal location, close to Macy's, Nordstrom and Pike's Place Market.

<comment category="positive" id="UR119871906">Charming hotel. The standard rooms are very small, but pleasantly decorated and squeaky clean. Large lobby with comfortable seating. Go to Olivers for great drinks and the Andaluca Restaurant for a great meal. Best of all, located in a good neighborhood, easy walk to Pike Market, the waterfront, and across the street from the monorail that takes you to the Needle. The light-rail from the airport to Westlake Center is $2.75 pr person, the Mayflower is right next door.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119841020">The location is right downtown. One could walk there from the new Seattle light rail system provided you walked out the right door of the terminal! The rooms are right on the street and they do tend to be a tad noisy but not as bad as they could be. I had a corner room which are good sized but the bathrooms are downright tiny. The bellmen were ever so much fun.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119832102">The Mayflower is a great hotel, and I'd definitely stay there again. Very clean, nice staff, very low key. The location could not have been better, close to great restaurants, shopping, two movie theatres and the station for the train to the airport. The bed was comfy. My only minor complaint was the walls in my room were a little thin, so I could hear conversations next door pretty well. Luckily I had quiet and considerate neighbors for every night, except one.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119681462">I love the Mayflower. Even though I don't get any kind of frequent traveler points, I love staying here. The staff is so nice - with manners and a level of service and pride that is hard to find, even in some nicer hotels where I have stayed. The location is great if you want to take the Light Link rail into downtown from the airport (which is a great inexpensive option over taking a cab as long as you don't mind a lot of walking). The hotel is about a block from the Westlake Station. Some of the rooms are a little on the small side, and yes the hotel is old. But I see a welcome attention to cleanliness and I've never smelled a musty smell as some have described. I also love that they have kept the original bathtubs in the bathrooms. They bathrooms are also small and are probably a tight fit for larger people, but I love the deep tubs where you can actually take a nice soak. Also, they have nice bath amenities that are dispensed from larger bottles mounted in the shower and next to the sink. So if you really want to add to your collection of tiny bath supplies, you will be out of luck - but I like the economy of this choice. The comfy robes in each room are a bonus. I would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than the Mayflower!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119640513">What a great Hotel. Staff was great. Doorman really fun and helpful. Reminiscent of the old classic hotels. The room had two double beds and two baths. Our room looked out at the Space Needle and had a window you could really open to hear the urban sounds of the city. Nice bar/restaurant in hotel but was not serving food after nine pm on weekdays but found out a PF Changs is only two storefronts away and open late. Will return again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119487464">My wife and i stayed here October 14th and 15th. The room was very well apointed and large, more like a suite. Bed room and sitting room could be divided. Price was very fair. Service was excellent and the location can't be beat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119338989">The price was fair based on the central location; walking distance from Pike's Market Place and the water, and practically everything else. : ) The room was quite small for the price, however, and it had a musty smell. The service was outstanding, however. After I'd been in my room for about 30 minutes, the front desk called to ask if the room was satisfactory; there are always doormen waiting to get the door for you, and everyone is very friendly. I would stay here again. While the rooms could use a little updating, they are clean and everything I needed was at my fingertips.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119309337">Stayed for 2 nights recently w/the BF &amp; couldn't believe how awesome everything was! As I'm an Entertainment Card member, was able to book the room for 50% off the rack rate, which was still over 20% off the seasonal rate, and there was no fee or penalty for cancellation. The hotel is actually attached to Westlake Center, which is located directly over the Westlake Transit Tunnel, through which not only the LINK rail from Sea-Tac is connected but also several city &amp; suburban express busses pass through. As we'd arrived on the Amtrak, it was a quick (FREE!) ride from the station to the hotel. We arrived a couple of hours prior to check-in but the front desk was very accommodating &amp; gave us a room immediately, with the offer that if we had any issues w/noise or location that they'd willingly move us to a different room. As the hotel's website said, it's decorated in a traditional style so if you're looking for ultra modern, this won't be for you. However, the decor didn't matter to us as much as location, comfort &amp; service and this hotel has all of those in spades! The room is exactly per their website's "Classic Guestroom" photo: generously proportioned w/a separate walk-in closet w/safe, full entertainment armoire, work desk &amp; seating area, the bed linens were wonderful (altho the mattress was a little too soft for my liking), and the bathroom was a decent size too. Their toiletries are very high quality Gieves &amp; Hawkes, which I really appreciated! I also like that their shower curtain rail is curved out so there's no icky wet curtain to stick to your skin. There's plenty of counter space for personal wash bags as well. There's in-room wifi which requires a password (changed monthly) but that's already on a card w/in the room. The signal wasn't always @ full bars but never dropped. I would comment however that there's no fan in the bathroom so the mirrors get foggy, and that the towel rack/bar is located @ the back of the tub/shower enclosure itself &amp; there's only 2 hooks which are installed @ the top of the bathroom door, thus the towels get a bit damp after a shower. Also, when I was trying to hang my towel after showering I either had to hang it over the tub (awkward reach) or jump up to try &amp; catch the door hooks (I'm 5' tall). I would really suggest to the hotel to look @ installing some extra bars/hooks to separate the new/dry towels, which already take up all the space on the existing rack, from used/wet towels elsewhere in the bathroom. The concierge &amp; doormen were really helpful w/dining &amp; shopping suggestions, and due to some pretty wacky weather, we were glad to take advantage of the complimentary umbrellas which were available to guests. We didn't eat in Andaluca but did order an American Breakfast room service to share (yay for US portions!) which was very delicious &amp; delivered promptly on a sturdy wooden tray w/linens &amp; cutlery. We were able to request a late checkout and when I mentioned some noise from the "Occupy Seattle" demonstrations, the lady said we should've told them as they would have happily moved us to a room on the other side of the hotel. The noise wasn't a big deal when the windows were closed tho so I didn't feel like a complaint needed to be made. All in all, the Mayflower Park Hotel is definitely on our list when we visit Seattle again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119196382">Hotel might need to update some rooms. The bathroom in ours was a bit dumpy. Wallpaper peeling off the wall. And there was no place to hang a towel around the sink area. Only towel holders were in the shower â€”Â which I hate â€”Â and on the back of the door. We stayed here at the end of a trip to Seattle. At the beginning of the trip we stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8 and it was really nice. New hotels are the way to go. Or updated ones...<topic>none</topic>

The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. The rooms are spotless and the bellman Sen was so friendly and helpful. The room itself had 2 beds and 2 restrooms so we were able to get ready alot faster than with just one. This was a pleasant surprise. It is an easy walk to lots of shops and Pike Place market which is alot of fun. I cannot say enough about the service we received while we were there. They even had a free wine tasting on Wednesday evening and that was alot of fun. I would highly recommend the Mayflower Park to everyone<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119084563">This is an edited review - I deleted my earlier review due to what happened after we checked out. Service - top notch, room - very comfortable, clean. Size of room - on the small side, but well appointed - coffee, TV, ice only on certain floors. Size of bathroom - ok, shower only, but only 18" between edge of sink &amp; wall of shower - large people are in trouble. Back to service - have to mention how helpful the doormen were. They held bags for us before we checked in (after some discussion), and again on our return. Concierge &amp; doormen were great with directions &amp; looked up bus routes as well. Why the edit? We were here on a group rate and entered a special code into the website. The quote I was given had tax = 0.00. Since the regular website quote showed tax, I assumed tax was included in the special rate. When I questioned it on check out, it was taken off (I had the e-mail confirmation), but then charged to my card two days later. Though they were correct that the tax was due (I was going to challenge it on my credit card but checked the group's site &amp; it did say "+ tax"), I feel a call or e-mail was appropriate explaining the re-charge. Thus, 1 star taken off a 5* review.<topic>none</topic>

Great idea! We had a breakfast/parking package that was perfect for us. The car valet was quick, friendly and helpful with directions. Breakfast choices were excellent with large but tasty portions.

The room was gorgeous. The food was lovely in the restaurant. the only faults I found was the fact my daughter couldn't go into the bar at all.....she's under 21. I can understand minors not sitting at the bar but they are usually allowed in some part of the bar. Made is awkward to order food during the day. Also the breakfast was a little overpriced.

<comment category="positive" id="UR118705090">The hotel has a great location in downtown Seattle - within walking distance to major attractions and retail. We had one of the four suites available - a corner room - which is well worth the cost. There was good natural light and cross ventilation. The hotel has been nicely renovated with comfortable seating areas and good lighting, sometimes a rarity in hotels. The bathroom could use a little better lighting and more surface to put toiletries. Robes are provided. The hotel is clean and staff is very accommodating. There is complimentary wi-fi and, if you need them, computers available to guests. Breakfast is not included, but there are plenty of places nearby to get a light meal. (There seems to be a Starbucks on every corner. Not surprising since they started here.) For dinner, one night, we wanted a casual dinner and the concierge directed us to the Icon Grill, a restaurant with a wide variety of choices. Despite its casualness, the place is decorated with a lot of art, including an abundance of Chihuly glass. It was a good recommendation. You will need a car to get to places like Bellvue or Capitol Hill, home of the renowned Elliott Bay Book Store. However, the hotel provides valet parking and they are very efficient at retrieving your car quickly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118635827">Stayed here 4 nights for a business conference. The hotel is an older property but very nicely furnished. The room, while small (common for older properties), was very comfortable &amp; adequate for one person. The only complaint was that the lamps were a little dim for reading. The bathroom was on the small side (again, common for older properties) but fine for me. Instead of small bottles of shampoo, etc, there were larger pump bottles of shampoo, conditioner, &amp; lotion in the bathroom (a good brand) which makes more sense to me. There were plenty of towels as well as robes in the room. The bed was very comfortable. I had requested a refrigerator when I made my reservation, and one was already in my room when I checked in. The staff was very courteous and helpful throughout my stay, even getting me a taxi within 10 minutes at 5am. Internet access is free. There are 2 small computers available for free use in the lobby (15 minute limit per session) &amp; you can print your boarding passes. The concierge was always helpful. There is a restaurant &amp; lounge on the premises. I did not try the restaurant but Seattle locals I talked to in my meetings said that it is very good. The lounge is good; the appetizers are big enough for a meal. The hotel is very centrally located. It is within 1 block of the Light Rail to the airport and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is only 3 blocks from the Pike Street market &amp; within easy walking distance of lots of shopping &amp; restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here &amp; would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118368155">This hotel has charm galore and the location is great. Its across the street from a large Macy's Dept Store and a 5-10 minute walk to the Pike Place Public Market and a quirky restaurant called The Pink Door. Conveniently there is a large drug chain store across the street in the opposite direction. There's a lot of shopping in the area. The hotel staff is very helpful and pleasant. The hotel upgraded me to a junior suite which had a full bath &amp; a 3/4 bath, 2 large closets, a living area and a separate bedroom with 2 queen beds. There were french doors between the living and bedroom areas and a flat screen TV in each area. The view looked out on the Space Needle &amp; the lights of the city. The lobby is relaxed in an almost European style. This hotel is sort of old school, in a good way. The Mayflower Park was perfect for a woman travelling alone because it has human scale and a genteel quality. By the way, breakfast in Andaluca, their casual restaurant, was delicious and they put plenty on the plate!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118076416">The Mayflower Park Hotel is beautiful, charming, and an absolutely wonderful place to stay. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful, the rooms lovely and comfortable, and the hotel, overall, is elegant yet inviting. In planning our pre- and post-cruise stay in Seattle, my friend and I wanted to find a nice downtown location, and a unique hotel that would add to a great vacation experience. The Mayflower Park far exceeded those expectations, and our stay there was memorable in and of itself. The cruise package, which included transportation to and from the pier, as well as breakfast in the excellent Andaluca restaurant, was great. No worries, no stress - the staff took care of everything, and we had a great start to our travel days. I would also like to extend a special "thank you" to the manager at the registration desk for his kindness. When we returned from our cruise on Sunday morning, we were exhausted. Although it was still before check-out time (and long before check-in time), I asked him when our room might be ready, and he offered to call us as soon as it was available. Not 15 minutes later, we received the call AND we had been given an upgrade to a suite. It hardly needs to be said that we were treated very, very well at the Mayflower Park, and highly recommend this marvelous hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117723071">We were trying to decide which hotel to stay at. We found several in our price range, but couldn't decide so we went for a Travelocity Mystery hotel. The one we chose was well reviewed even though they don't tell you the name until after you book. We took a chance and ended up at the Mayflower Park Hotel. It was right in the middle of downtown, right where we wanted to be. We flew in and took the Light Rail from Sea Tac Airport and got off within a few blocks of the hotel. The Mayflower Park Hotel is older but beautifully redone in pretty original form. It was extremely clean and the staff made us feel like we were old friends visiting. We were invited to a wine tasting in the restaurant and were served in a first class manner. Our room was nicely decorated and had everything we needed. We were on the 11th floor with a great view of the downtown area. The bed was wonderful, didn't want to get up in the morning, but felt great when we did. We slept with the windows open so we could hear the sounds of the city. The room was very quiet with them closed. This will be our first choice for our next stay in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117464163">We stayed here for a friend's wedding because it was one of the hotels that had the wedding discount rate. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the valet parking is a great value ($20/day). Super convenient location to Pike Place Market and surrounding shops/restaurants. We had a car but the light rail is right downstairs if you're coming from the airport and the monorail (also right there) takes you to the Space Needle. Our room on a high floor was a bit on the small side but it was very clean and had ample electrical outlets (I find that older buildings usually don't have enough outlets). The bathroom was nice but the showerhead was really low so not very good for tall people. My partner is 6 feet tall so he had to stoop a little. The water pressure sucked so it was more like a sprinkle than a shower. We didn't ask to change rooms since it was only for 2 nights. There is a small gym that's decent and we made use of it but unfortunately, it is not open 24 hrs. Cocktails and appetizers at Oliver's were quite enjoyable although overall, I'd say hotel and bar guests are on the other side of 50 (read: Gramps would love it). In hindsight, I could probably have found a less expensive room in the same area and one where there was a hotel loyalty program but we were content staying here and it's especially great for the proximity to the wedding venue.<topic>none</topic>

This is our 4th stay at this hotel and each time we have been treated very well. I tried to book online but experienced "technical" problems so I called. Mary- you were so helpful. She booked us in a standard queen and we arrived Richard had a great surprise. A lovely upgrade to the 12th floor suite...What can I say! The staff really made our anniversary the best... Many thanks to all. We will be back! And thank you for the signed card and chocolates!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116886040">The Mayflower Hotel exceeded our expectations and was first class service all the way! It was a nice touch and a great surprise to receive an anniversary card and chocolates sent by the staff. The room was great - very spacious and with 2 bathrooms. We loved it all - enjoyed dinner at the Andeluca - delicious food and wonderful service. We have bragged about the Mayflower to all of our friends and relatives! Wish we could have stayed longer - just a short walk to Pike's Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116819244">I can't say enough good things about the Mayflower. When I called to make reservations, the reservations rep was sooooo helpful and informative. And I was not disappointed when we arrived. Every person that I dealt with from the Bellman to the Concierge to the Front Desk Personnel were truly service oriented and friendly as well. I was so impressed. This hotel, obviously, trains their staff very well. And the hotel is also located in a great place -- next to several restaurants like the Dahlia Lounge, Lola's &amp; Serious Pie and lots of shopping like Macy's, boutiques, etc. Wonderful experience! Will stay here on my next visit for sure!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR113764200">I just stayed there for 3 nights on a business trip. I will not be staying there again. The walls are not sound-proofed at all, so you can hear every little sound in neighboring rooms. I had an extremely noisy couple in the room next to me who kept me up until 4 am when I had to get up at 6 am for my work obligations. The bathroom floor and tub were moldy. My company paid for my stay in full ahead of time, about $400. I gave them my credit card up front for incidentals, and they put a $1600 hold on it and attempted to charge me for $800. Luckily, my credit card company alerted me to the unusual transaction. When I called the hotel to ask for the charges, they stated that they only did an $800 hold, which is still a lot for a stay already paid in full. It took a while to remove the $1600 hold. Luckily, my credit card company called me. Otherwise, I would have been mistakenly charged $800 of that $1600 hold.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR113268542">We (another couple and my wife and I) use the pre-cruise package. First of all very nice hotel. Easy to get to from the airport. Had I known just how easy the rail system was and how close it was (like it is right at the mall connected to the hotel) this may have bee the way to get there from the airport. Great location and walking distance to everything that one would probably want to see on a one night stay over. East check in and check out. The breakfast included was just fantastic (not a continental buffet deal). The included transportaion and tip from the driver on how to get ahead of the cruise terminal check in process was most time saving! Would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR112144859">This was my second stay at the Mayflower. The first time (December 2009) I had a double room which was a reasonable size and value for money - we got a late deal through Expedia. On this stay, the service was good, the staff polite, friendly and helpful. Check in and out was quick and easy. However, the twin room I'd booked was cramped, the hairdryer had a dodgy connection and the toiletries in the bathroom were not great. The standard probably hasn't changed from my first stay and my comments are all made in relation to the amount I paid for the room on each occasion. The first visit was a good deal, the second quite a bit more expensive and I therefore didn't feel I was getting value for money - hence the three stars.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR102732497">I am a regular with hotels, as my business requires me to travel frequently. I booked this hotel for a one night stay in order to photograph Seattle. I try to review various hotels, especially if the experience is significant. The Mayflower Park was a massive disappointment in -Appearance -Accommodation -Most importantly, customer service. Check-in was average; however I noticed that in the "business center" (standing kiosks only) we could see guests conducting their business at computer stations. The room was shabby at best, and about the size of a closet. We walked in and noticed that the room was dingy, small, and had only one bed. I am disabled; room size is easy to overlook, if the room is presented acceptably and I can get around. We requested a second bed: No can do. We requested audience with a manager and let him know very clearly we were not happy. He was accusatory and combative, but kindly offered a roll-away bed. We finally conceded, and the manager continued to be combative. After that was over, we decided to see the city. Apparently the hotel was connected to access for various methods of transportation. Not for us; we were sent outside and around the building as the result of an event happening at the hotel. Again, I'm disabled which is unfortunately clearly visible. Regardless, we were sent outside in slick rain on concrete, with no assistance offered by doormen. I had to grapple down wet cement stairs and into rain. After clearing yet another flight of stairs, we made it to our transportation. Upon our return to the hotel, we called to request a roll away. After four hours and three calls to the front desk, it came. An employee set it up, and left absolutely no clear path to the restroom as a result of the small room. That is not possible for me-again, he could see that I was in need of better accommodation, so he moved furniture all over the place attempting to clear a small opening for me to reach a restroom in the night. Up to this point the entire hotel experience had not only been inconvenient, but extremely dangerous. Then our neighbors chirped in. We could hear the conversations of hotel guests in rooms next to us through the walls. The next morning, we checked out. We looked to the front desk after checkout, just in time to see the hotel's (very) young manager clearly talking about us as we walked away. It was one of the most demoralizing experiences of my life.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR91421098">I have stayed at this hotel at least eight times- usually chosen because of its great location. This New Years Eve, my husband and I got a room that was more like a closet- it was clean enough, except that it had a musty smell with the addition of the aroma of old food and dirty carpet. The bathroom was in need of a total- gutting. Mold, broken tiles, chipped paint and altogether way too small to get dressed in ease and comfort. My toiletries fell off of the little ledge into the toilet, which by the way was jammed up against the wall- not comfortable or hygenic in my opinion. This hotel should shut rooms down and revise the floor plan- the rates they charge would then be realistic for the room size and better set up.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR88585922">We were booked in here by a friend, and had heard good things about the hotel. The location is excellent. We liked everything about the hotel, but found it a bit cramped, and a bit tired, with a room that was on the small side compared with what we are used to in Seattle for the same price. There is an excellent bar/restaurant whose name I can't remember. I would recommend the hotel, but probably would look around before booking back in there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR84142085">We were five in a family suite. The rooms are nice, clean, maybe a bit heavy on the flowery decoration side, but that is just me. Breakfast was excellent, the restaurant has won some prices but we didn't try the evening menue. Service was great and the location is in the middle of downtown Seattle. Even the vale parking was quick and at $20/Day cheaper than driving the car yourself into the underground parking next door.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83420061">My wife and I opted to break from our usual chain stays to take in this hotel, because it is ideally situated close to the Pike Place Market and the Monorail. I can't speak positively enough about the location. It is in or near the center of everything touristy. The price is competitive with the chains in the market, and it's worth it to eschew earning points for a more convenient and frankly nicer room. Upon the advice of some of the other reviewers, we opted for a double queen room over the standard queen room to get more space. For an extra $20 nightly, we got two queen beds, room to spread out and two full bathrooms. The view of the surrounding area is terrific from the room, and the air condition in our room is above average. The service was prompt, gracious, and appreciative. The valet was prompt and eager. The classic elegance of the lobby and attention upon check in are not to be missed. The room itself was clean and updated. There are no plugs above desk level (important if you travel with several electronic devices), but plugs located above baseboard level all around the room more than make up for this. The HD Visio television in the room was not overly large but does the job. Curtains can be closed completely. The bed is hard, but not overbearingly so. Not great for a bad back, but it won't leave you immobilized like some other chain beds. The bathrooms are satisfactory. However, the shower head is difficult to deal with if you're taller than 5' 4" and would be unusable for an extended stay if you are exceptionally tall (they are fine, however, for persons of size). The bathrooms in our room were not vented, and that lends to giving the rooms a dirtier appearance. It appears as if the walls in the rooms and their respective doors had been neither painter nor cleaned in quite some time. Skip the room service from Oliver's. Delivery was prompt and the price was reasonable but the food was not very good. For those of us who are late risers, the noon check out time is appreciated. Don't let the negatives distract you from the overwhelming positives, unless you are over 6' tall, however. The location is fantastic, the rooms themselves are really well done, the lobby exudes elegance and the view is fantastic from the upper floors.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR82906911">Very nice hotel, we had booked a double double Queen room and to our surprise we also had 2 bathrooms. we were on the 12th floor so had views of space needle . the hotel is only a 5-10 min walk to the markets. you are also able to walk to the shopping centre next door via an inside walkway . There is also the monorail station to the space needle and the underground transit stop in the shopping complex so getting around is no problem. The Martini bar was very nice and and relaxing and the staff were very knowlegable on the martini menu. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast but is was very nice and i thought the prices were reasonable. There are 2 computers next to the Check in desk that you can use and also print from (free of charge). all the staff were friendly and helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR82159252">Excelllent hotel in a very good location. A short walk to Pikes Market and other downtown places, and near the monorail to the Seattle Tower/Needle - well worth a trip and lunch). We were impressed by the Concierge service before we even arrived - Wendy (chef Concierge) kindly emailed me very detailed and helpful explanation of the various ways of getting from Seatac airport to hotel, which were spot on. During our two stays (on the way in to Washington state - 3 night stay, and on the way out - 1 night stay) the Concierges helped us immensly. Top marks for that. Check in was brief and courteous, but a "doorman"? (or perhaps he was just a flunky dressed up to stand around uselessly) watched my wife and I struggle on through the front door (here there are no bellhops) with three suitcases, but didnt even come to hold the door open for us! On the other (side) door, there are several bellhops who are very helpful and courteous. During our 2nd stay, there was a conference going on which took over the upper section of the lobby, where we previously had enjoyed sitting and reading, and which also meant the exit to the mall and train centre next door was locked. Noisy, too, with recpetions going on a lot, drowning out the ablity to hold a conversation in reception at times. Perhaps the hotel should organise a private room for these events. Otherwise, very enjoyable stay, and<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81198680">When I need to stay in downtown Seattle, I only stay in one of two places, the Mayflower and the Red Lion (5th Ave). This location is the best---Westlake Center is in the same block (and Westlake Center is really "ground zero" for downtown Seatte). The light rail stop is very close (and that is the best and cheapest way downtown from the airport). But the best thing about the Mayflower is the staff. Five stars isn't high enough for them. When you ask the staff how long they have worked there it's usually decades not years. It's hard to find someone who has been there less than 5 years---in many other hotels it's hard to find someone who has been there there 5 years. It's not like working in a hotel is a glanorous job, so the owners and management must be doing something right and it shows. They are loyal to the hotel and guests. If you're looking for a place to stay in downtown Seattle, quit looking and book here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR80555184">My wife and I stayed in a Deluxe Queen 9/13-9/15/10, following a cruise. All of the staff was very helpful. The room was comfortable, clean and a little smaller than many motel rooms but worked out well. The room has a safe. The bath is rather small. Very convenient as many have noted. We stopped by Oliver's the first night to get something to eat as we did not want to go out (Andaluca's was closed). My wife and I ordered a turkey club sandwich and a fruit plate. Look out, it was enough food for four and was extremely value priced for Seattle. Our last morning we had breakfast at Andaluca's. Look out, there was a lot of food for the price! The only negative was that the two computer stations were right next to the front desk and on a shelf in the open rather than in a business room or secluded area. The computer screens were very small. Having said that, you can print right to the desk clerk's printer and have your copies immediately handed to you.<topic>none</topic>

We were very pleased with the results. We arrived from a late flight... and were greeted with enthusiasm by the doorman and the receptionist. We were too late for dinner, but eventually found ourselves in Oliver's, the Mayflower Park's superb bar, and ordered two of their famous 'best' martini's. And they were. During our two night stay... everyone was friendly and helpful. While we had opted for the lowest priced room, it was very clean, although somewhat small.

Even if you don't stay at the hotel, the potato croquettes at Andaluca are not to miss.

<comment category="positive" id="UR79287190">We spent four nights here on a sightseeing trip to Seattle and selected hotel based on location. Were we right here! We took the light rail Link in from the airport for $1.25 each (senior rate) and got off at the end - Westlake Center. From there we had some initial difficulty finding the entrance into the hotel even after asking the guards. At Westlake Center one can pick up the Link, the monorail to Space Needle, the free buses. Plus one can walk to Pike Market in about 10 minutes. We upgraded to a Deluxe Queen which had about 265 square feet and took the breakfast package. The food in the hotel Andaluca's (where we ate breakfast and had one dinner) and loved the bar lounge Oliver's where we went every night for drinks and appetizers. Light snacks and sandwiches here - could be your dinner. Lots of locals drop in to bar. Very lively and young. Even though hotel was built in 1927 and it does feel old, bathroom is modernized and staff service is outstanding. Really helpful people. We plan on staying here at our next visit in about 6 months.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR79173182">We stayed 2 nights &amp; were very pleased with the hotel &amp; our rooms. The rates were reasonable for such a nice hotel. The lobby is very well decorated with plenty of plush seating. We didn't pay the $20/night parking, because we took the rail from the airport for $2.50/pp to the station connected to the hotel and it was not a problem at all if you have only 1 bad with rollers. The shopping mall is also connected to the hotel. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly from check in to check out. The rooms were nice with unlimited quality shampoo, conditioner, and lotion dispensers &amp; soaps. The bed was very comfortable &amp; our room had a good view. The room was quiet &amp; very pleasant. The staff left a couple truffles in our friend's room, who was celebrating a b-day. The Andaluca restaurant was excellent for breakfast and the food &amp; drinks we had in the bar one evening were extremely good as well. The hotel was centrally located and we walked a few blocks to almost everything (to Pike Market, Argosy cruise station, to the railway which travels to the space needle, ducks, etc). There is also a PF Changs across the street, very convenient, &amp; Starbucks is on the same block. The only negative experience at this lovely hotel was that the fitness room is too warm; the portable A/C unit just could never cool the room enough to enjoy your workout. Otherwise, everything else was wonderful and I would definitely return to this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR77598996">This was a classy joint. It was non-pretentious and encompassed what a downtown hotel should be. The interior was vintage yet classy. The service was 5-Star. The only thing I noticed was that the walls seemed thin. As I sat at the desk in our room drinking my coffee I could hear the conversation in the room next to us. That was the absolute only thing I noticed as a negative though. The downstairs bar was great!

<comment category="positive" id="UR76985750">The Mayflower is perfectly located within walking distance of all must sees in Seattle. The staff and concierge service could possibly be the most knowledgeable and friendly folks I have had to work with in quite some time. The hotel has this vintage feel from entrance to room. The rooms have size and are very workable for two people. If you need a break the hotel offers a great bar/restaurant for those who are coming back from a long day of touring etc... The mall and monorail are connected to the hotel so getting to the space needle is as simple as going up a few escalators. I highly recommend this Seattle hotel for anyone who is traveling to Seattle for business or pleasure. One can only hope you will enjoy this place as much as I.<topic>none</topic>

Had a corner room on the fifth floor and it was very quiet. Hotel is conveniently attached to the Westlake Center. You can ride the monorail ($2 one-way) to the Seattle Center from the Westlake Center and there is a station to catch the metro transit (bus tunnel - ride free from 6 a.m. - 7 p.m.).

<comment category="positive" id="UR74836300">We arrived early back from an Alaskan cruise.No rooms were available at the time so after leaving our bags with concierge and a trip to get some coffee and breakfast one was available. (side note: cannot believe how quiet Seattle is early Sunday morning). Staff were friendly, helpful and courteous. I chose this hotel as my partner likes historic places and for it's great location being central downtown Seattle and near to transport such as the light rail to the airport and monorail to go to Seattle Center. The decor is subtle and feels like a average persons nice hotel from yesteryear rather than plush like a Fairmont style hotel (which is what I think many expect it to be). I went for the deluxe room as I do not like small standard hotel rooms, the room was larger than expected, but a very small bathroom. During the day the room was noisy with banging from around and upstairs, however was quiet at night. The mattress was uncomfortable for me and I woke many times during he night with a sore back (stretches and a hot shower fixed that), my partner had no problem though. Olivers and the restaurant were nice and if you want to eat on the cheap, there's plenty of places to chose from next door in Westlake Center The room was on special at time of booking, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen this hotel given the amount to chose from in Seattle. If I needed to quickly book a hotel downtown for a night I would stay here again, but if I had time I'd try somewhere else due to the mattress and normal price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR74199852">We arrived at 10 am, fresh from an Alaskan Cruise and were delighted to find that our room was ready for us to occupy. Check-in was quick and efficient, no difficulty finding our reservation, and Reception staff friendly and efficient. Room was spotless and well equipped , but could really have done with having to bed-side cabinets and reading-lights. this apart the only other minor criticism for a couple of Brits was that there were no tea making facilities other than in a coffee filter-maker. these do produce tea (of a sort) but not what Brits like. Concierge and Reception were able to answer all queries about "how to get to .... how long does it take .... what buses to catch ... etc". This Hotel is an older building (c 1920's) and has the character that so many modern "people-processing plants" lack, whilst still giving service for the 2010's. Location is very good for shops. restaurants, Pike Place Market (an absolute must for any visitor to Seatle), mono-rail to the Space Needle, Museum, Art Gallery.

<comment category="positive" id="UR73471947">I was on a long road trip from Phoenix to Seattle before flying up to Alaska for 10 days. We'd been driving for some time and were really excited to pull up to the doormen and relax for a while. We like staying in Historic Hotels and places with a little back history so the Mayflower was perfect. The lobby was full of people which is always nice to see and we were able to check in a few hours early. The room was great, very clean, very traditional but with a great view of the city on two sides. Great bathroom! We got several recommendations from the doormen/bellmen on where to go (first time in Seattle) and good places to eat. We parked our car overnight ($20 overnight which is fine) and in the morning it was waiting for us as they said it would be. Overall it was great and we really enjoyed ourselves. No noise from the streets when you are sleeping so that's a bonus. The elevators always have staff in them but they were always nice and we just figured since it' s an older building they don't have a service elevator. Comes with the territory and only a negative if the staff were not outgoing and friendly, which they were. Great trip and highly recommend the hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR73083610">Eight family members, four rooms. Depending on which room you get, you'll love it or be really disappointed. Me and hubby got the tiniest room I've ever stayed in with an even tinier bathroom. Wow, a larger person would have difficulty getting into the shower in this bathroom as the sink blocks the shower entry. The bed was pretty comfy and our room was very quiet. The other three rooms my relative received were huge! Actually twice the size of our room with a full bath as well. The only thing is all bathrooms have a glass over the back of the sink which makes it challenging to wash your face without hitting your forehead on the glass. Strange. There is a doorman at both street entrances and they are very friendly and helpful. The front desk staff were helpful and pleasant. The lobby is lovely, we especially enjoyed the mezzanine lobby area which was like we were sitting in a living room. I tend to go for boutique type hotels and this one did not dissapoint even though our room was tiny. We all agreed that we enjoyed our stay in this lovely hotel. The Mall being "attached" to the hotel made going back and forth so easy. We also enjoyed our breakfast at Andaluca. We would definitely stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR72494307">After much searching on TA, I chose this hotel for it's location. We traveled to Seattle from Philadelphia for a one night stay on July 10th before heading to Victoria (Vancouver Island) on the Clipper. I did not want to rent a car in Seattle so this was perfect for us. From Seatac, we took the Light Rail to the last stop and then a short walk to the hotel. Our room was smallish but clean and comfy for $200. We liked walking to Pikes Market, Elliotts on the water for a late lunch in the sun, and the monorail that took us directly to the Space Needle. At the end of the day, we went to the hotel bar (Oliver's) for their signature, award winning martinis. Early the next day we took a cab to pier 69 which was easy enough except we had to wait for a very long train to pass which jacked up the fare considerably!<topic>none</topic>

My husband and I arrived to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary at the Mayflower Park for a stay of 4 days. We were impressed from the moment we set foot in front of the hotel. We were met with a smile by a friendly doorman who welcomed us. We had arrived at 1:00 in the morning very tired and needing a good nights rest. The gentleman at the desk also gave a a very big welcome and proceeded to check us in quickly and afficiently Upon hearing that we were there celebrating our anniversary he gave us a certificate for 2 free cocktails in their wonderful martini cocktail lounge. What a nice way to start our stay! We found our room a mini king size suite to be beautiful, comfortable, very clean and quiet. The next morning we had breakfast in their restaurant Anduluca. The breakfast choices were wonderful as were the wait staff. The breakfast was also included in the price of each night we stayed at the hotel ,which I must say is the best deal in town. Each morning we had a delicious breakfast which was prepared to a tee,(my favorite being the stuffed french toast YUM!!) and some great conversation with the wait staff. They were always helpful with ideas of things we should do or see,and all their recommendations were great. It was a nice way to start our day. The concierge, Sean, was also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He made reservations at 2 of Seattles finest restaurants for us and we loved them both. Lets get back to LOCATION. This little grand hotel is right in the hub of all that is going on in Seattle.Shopping surrounds you,from Nordstroms, Macys, to the world famous Pikes Market which is only 2 blocks away. Great fun at Pikes and we visited it every day. The hotel is also conveniently located 1 block from the Lite Rail which is a great train ride that takes you to and from Seattles Seatac airport. It costs only $2.50 each way and we found it to be clean and comfortable. What a great perk, as a taxi ride from the airport can cost around $40. We made use of our certificate for our 2 Free cocktails at Olivers their martini cocktail lounge and once again were so happy with the service and genuine friendliness of the staff. The drinks were delish! The Mayflower Park is attached to Westlake center where there is a shuttle that will take you to the Space Needle which is just a short 3 minute ride away. You can't ask for more than this hotel offers. They are truly a great example of what a hotel stay should be like. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation to any one staying in Seattle. P.S. We never experienced a long wait for the elevator which was mentioned in some of the other reviews!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR72268880">Where do I start? I stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for 6 days and 6 nites. I chose the hotel based on the location and the good reviews it got from Tripadvisor. I was not disappointed. The service I experienced was excellent, first class.Everybody at this hotel make you feel special. Everyone was so attentive and so helpful, from the front desk staff to the Concierge, ALL the staff. My room was a Deluxe Queen and very elegant. After a long day exploring the city it was a pleasure to come to my room to relax and get a good nites sleep. The bed was elegant and very comfy. I also liked the fact that the room had a coffee maker with complimentary coffee and an electronic safe. I was also told at the front desk that if I wanted to a small refrigerator could be brought to my room at no extra charge! The location of the hotel was also excellent. It is centrally located and within walking distance to many great attractions. There is a shopping center (Westlake Center) very close to the hotel where you can do a lot of shopping or grab a bite to eat at the food court. On the third floor you can buy your tickets to take the monorail that takes you to the Seattle Center area where the Space Needle and other attractions are located. A few block south of the hotel you find the famous Pike Market. I strongly recommend starting your day with breakfast at Lowells Restaurant at the Pike Market. Its very affordable and the three floor restaurant has excellent views of the waterfront. In sum, I had a great stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel and whenever I go back to Seattle I will stay there again. :-) PS. If you are traveling solo it is more affordable to take the Grey LIne Downtown Airporter that takes you from the airport to many hotels in downtown Seattle. I was dropped off at the Westin Hotel which is less than a block away from the Mayflower Park. I only paid $25 for the round ticket. A taxi would have cost me $35-40 one way.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR71803369">I grabbed this good deal on Hotwire for about $80 per night. Of course, being right in the city, we had to pay for valet parking through the hotel for $20 per night. But this still was cheaper than most hotels in the area. This hotel was by far the fanciest accommodations we stayed in on our trip to Washington State, and a great way to end our vacation. Since we left the car with the valets (and didnâ€™t want to pay for parking around the city), we simply walked everywhere around town. Pike Place Market is just four blocks from the hotel, and the waterfront is just a few blocks past that. We walked over to the Seattle Center (10 blocks), but have to admit that we rode the monorail back. It stops right in the mall that connects to the back of the hotel--very convenient!! We also walked to Pioneer Square (13 blocks) and even walked to the REI flagship store (13 blocks). We stayed on the 8th floor, looking towards 5th Street. Our room with a king-sized bed was super comfy and everything was extremely clean.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR71247877">I stayed here 2 nights before the business part of my trip would start. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had booked a regular room but at check-in I was informed that I had been upgraded to a king suite which was great. The location of the hotel was great, across the street from Macy's, and perfect for exploring Seattle on foot. The room itself was big, with a separate sitting room. The bathroom was a little small in comparison. Shower was great. The decor of the room was supposed to be European style but the flowery motive was a little bit overdone. I had a good time staying here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR70106760">Stayed for 2 nights in a Classic room. A bit on the small side, but very nicely appointed. Great location - I walked almost everywhere I needed to go, but the Westlake station is almost under the hotel if you need transport. Very pleasant staff and a welcoming atmosphere. Would definitely stay again if I returned to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68878678">I've stayed at many hotels in Seattle, including the Olympic, the Sorrento, and the Inn at the Market. Although perhaps not as elegant as the others, the Mayflower Park was a terrific place to stay. The room was a large corner queen with lots of windows and light. The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and welcoming. There were nice touches such as a good Speakman shower head and excellent storage in the room. The restaurant was lovely for breakfast, again with great service. And the location cannot be beat for shopping -- steps from Nordstrom and Macy's -- lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Finally, the price was right. In all, a great stay. Thanks!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68271984">The Mayflower Park is a great hotel with an attentive and friendly staff, We booked this hotel as a recomendation from a friend and so glad we changed our reservations. I liked the small, personal feel of the property as well as it being a historical hotel - it has so much mnore character and history than many chain hotels. It is close to everything: we walked everywhere! Did take the monorail (1 block away) to Seattle Center - but walked back. Oliver's, the bar in the hotel, was very comfortable and makes great drinks. We stayed in a suite and it was just perfect for our family. The beds were super comfortable and although the rooms are small, having the extra living room and bathroom made our stay exceptional. The only cons I can think of is that the rooms are small (but cozy), no refrigerator in room and the fitness room is super small, however none of this effected our visit nor changed the positive review of the hotel, but others may like to know this. Can not wait to return !<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR67724161">We loved our stay here at the Mayflower Park. We were upgraded to a suite for our anniversary. The manager also sent a small box of candy and card to the room later that evening. Very nice. The room was quite roomy, 10th floor and a view. Great bed and quiet. We arrived about noon and were going to store luggage until the room was ready BUT it was ready. Unfortunately the restaurant was being renovated. They had a small continental breakfast set up in the lounge. That was okay but not worth the $12.00 each they charged us since it was really not any nicer than a free Holiday Inn Express breakfast. The waiters were great and very apologetic. They even used only paper products since they didn't have a dishwasher. We would have ventured out for breakfast but it was pouring.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66659111">I stayed here for 5 nights at the June. If you are used to the typical chain hotels, you may be disappointed, However, if you like a hotel with charm, quiet elegance and character, you will enjoy your stay here. Pros: Location (Right across the street from all public transportations, including Light Rail to Seatac airport). Polite &amp; courteous staff (The concierge was particularly helpful) Quiet inside and out. I even had the window open and barely heard any street noise Coffee Machine in room Enough hangers for clothes and plenty of drawer space Alot of lights in the room Free WIFI in the room One of the best ideas I've seen in a hotel room: Electrical outlets all along the baseboards in the room. No problems plugging in all your electronics. Clock radio also had a 'white noise' option, ie: The sound of the ocean, etc. Plus it was MP3 compatible, unlike the iPod-only clock radios found in most boutique hotels these days. Queen Size bed, but very comfortable Cons: Housekeeping: When I got to my room on the first day and was unpacking, I noticed some long, dark hairs in the drawers. I then noticed hairs in the bathroom...all over the floor, on the wall, in the shower. It was pretty disgusting and I almost asked to change rooms. I was hoping that the following day, the hair would be all cleaned up. However, when I returned to the room in the evening, I noticed that the room had not been cleaned at all!!! I did call downstairs for towels, which were brought up promptly. The good news, they did clean the room the following day and the floor, wall and shower hairs were gone too!! Unfortunetly the drawer hairs remained! Closet safe too high up. Hard to see inside when you are under 5'5'' No mini bar or little fridge in room Very strange and awkward location for magnifying mirror in the bathroom. It was positioned right over the toilet. Lousy water pressure and shower The main restaurant Andalucca was closed and my Seattle friends and I had been dying to try it, as it had top reviews. Summary: I would actually rate this hotel 4****, as it was comparible with most 4**** hotels I've stayed at. The price was very fair and you absolutely can't beat the location. The rooms were an average size, as was the bathroom. Ideal for one person, however usually you don't spend much time in the room when you are on vacation! Staying at a historical property is a nice change from all the chain hotels too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR65944391">My boyfriend and I live in Vancouver, BC and drove down to Seattle this past weekend, staying one night at Mayflower Park Hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It was a fantastic experience. Aside from the great location in Downtown Seattle and our clean room, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Every single person went above and beyond, anticipating and attending to our every need. I would definitely recommend this hotel over and over again. We have already raved to our friends about their service. We really felt your exceptional service made all the difference on our little weekend getaway.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR64589454">Our first trip to Seattle was a good one. We got lucky with the weather (it never rained) and this heritage hotel helped it be a positive experience. On check in we were initially a little disappointed that at 2 pm our room wasn't ready, the hotel didn't seem overly busy and as check out is 11 I had hoped that we would be able to get straight into our room after a lengthy flight. However as check in isn't listed as guaranteed until 4 pm we can't complain. The hotel took our number to call us when the room was ready and we headed off for the short walk to Pike Place Market. After a couple of hours the hotel never called us and this was typical of the staff there. Generally they were disinterested and for almost everything looked like too much trouble. The one exception to this was the concierge who was lovely, very friendly and helpful. Once in our room it was very large and although slightly dated, clean and everything worked. As well as a large comfortable bed there was room for a sofa, chair and plenty of room to move around. In modern hotels the space would have been partitioned and called a suite. Given such a large room the bathroom was tiny and although the fixtures were in good order, the tiny size, at odds to the room itself, was somewhat uncomfortable. The door could barely squeeze closed past the toilet howeverI guess this is typical of older properties. The hotel is well located next to the monorail stop and a short walk to the excellent light transit rail link which serves the airport as well as Union Square and the stadium area. I'd return for the location and the value.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR62604204">Stayed at the Mayflower with a family group in town for a wedding. In all we had 6 rooms, 3 generations. The hotel is very well located and is a very nice small hotel. The rooms and the lobby appear to have been renovated fairly recently. The lobby is small but nicely appionted. The restaurant is very nice - reasonably priced with well above average food. My wife and I requested a deluxe queen. The hotel only advertised that they had 3 types of rooms - Standard queen, Deluxe queen (larger) and Double queen. Upon arrival were were put into a King room (the clerk explained that they only have about a half dozen king rooms) Our room was very large - could have accomodated another King with adaquate walking room remaining. The double queen rooms appeared somewhat more cramped, with limited space next to the beds. As is common in older hotels, electric outlets is a bit of a challenge. No extra power near the bed, and we had to rotate power supplies to keep a laptop, cell phone and blackberry's all charged. One significant negative is the very VERY small bathrooms. A tub, sink and camode with room to stand is all you get. Nice shampoo and conditioner in large wall mounted pump bottles in the shower, a bar of soap and towels. No extras. My mother in law complained that there was nowhere to hang a towel - the only towel bar is in over the bathtub. The only other significant complaint is that the 2 very small elevators are inadaquate to service the 10 floor hotel. 4 - 5 minute waiting times were normal during peak hours. Each elevator can handle only 6 people at a time so arriving at the lobby to find 10 people waiting (happened more than once in our week long stay) resulted in an unacceptable wait. One other point to note - the matresses are rather firm. Great for my wife, not so great for me. I would probably stay here again, the location, amazing service and charm are worth the small bathroom. I would prearrange a 2nd or 3rd floor room however so I could avoid the elevators.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR62220619">I took my wife to Seattle for her bday and booked 2 nites in the Mayflower. Taking the Light Rail from SeaTac was a breeze, even if the train took 40 minutes; it drops you off on the same block as the hotel. The hotel is definitely well situated in the middle of all the action. The front desk personnel were very courteous and professional. We got a room on the 12th floor, right next to the elevator, which gave me pause -- I was concerned about noise, but decided not to object. To my chagrin, noise was a problem on the 2nd night, but not from the elevators, but from next-door guests. The hotel staff was thoughtful enough to send my wife a card and small box of chocolates for her bday which definitely brought a smile to her face. The room was clean and relatively small, as previously reported, and well appointed. We'd definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

The beds are super comfortable and the room was so quiet it felt like we had the place to ourselves! Everything was within walking distance!!!!! We ran the seawall (which starts just North of Pike Place) We ate at PF Chang's (next door) which was delicious!

<comment category="positive" id="UR60939042">We decided to stay at this hotel because we had stayed there previously many years ago and because of the great location. The location is very good for seeing the main tourist sites of Seattle. It is within walking distance to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square, the waterfront ferries and shopping. You could either walk to the Space Needle or take the Monorail from the shopping center that is next to the hotel. The hotel is also located across the street from Nordstrom and Macys for those who like to shop. The rooms were very clean but showed some age. The bathroom fixtures and bedspread had seen better days and should be replaced. The service from the staff was inconsistent. Some of the staff were very nice while others were not. Overall I would recommend this hotel and would have rated it higher had the service been more consistent and room been updated.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR60846667">I spent three nights at the Mayflower Park this week.. I'm somewhat surprised by the previous review shown below, as I had a very nice greeting at reception (even though I was arriving from the countryside in GoreTex and walking shoes due to the stormy weather, Iand found staff in both the hotel staff gracious and helpful). My room was booked at special rate on a 24-hour "special" so I certainly received no special treatment because of the room rate! My single room was somewhat small, but well-appointed. The bathroom is finished in sleek white tile and and is small, but I certainly did not find it unusually so, especially for an historic boutique-type hotel, where I have different expectations than when staying at a Sheraton or even a Ramada Inn. I don't know how this compares to other rooms in the hotel. Though I was given a room right adjacent to the elevator on the 10th floor, I could not .hear the elevator and noticed no noise. I also can't tolerate being next to an ice machine room, but it isn't located on the 10th, so can't comment. The previous poster complained that they didn't put a priate note for her husband on the pillow prior to their arrival, as she requested--As far as putting notes on pillows--this wouldn't occur to me to ask . Who would be doing this for the customer, and how would they know for certain which room would be assigned until the customer arrives? Asking a bit much, IMHO. The hotel's Andaluca Restaurant is a delight, with Mediterranean cuisine using local Northwest produce, seafood, etc. I highly recommend their prix fixe Mediterranean Tour menu, with several choices among three courses of samplers of of many kinds, at $18 at lunch, $30, dinner, pp. It also has an excellent staff, pleasant and efficient, but unobtrusive. All in all, I'd still recommend the Mayflower Park over others in its category for its convenient location and ambiance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR60564671">I chose the Mayflower Park carefully on the basis of reviews, for a week's stay in Seattle to visit our son at Uni and to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. We were looking forward to old fashioned charm and good service. Instead, we got a poky room with thin walls between the humming ice machine and the elevator with an air con system that rattled so much we had to turn it off before we went to bed! The bathroom was so small we could hardly turn round with the door closed ( we are both slim!) it was tatty and the shower-or rather the tap in the walll above the bath) was woefully inadequate. Our check in should have warned us. It was stiff, unfriendly and were were obviously just a bit of a nuisance. I had written to the hotel before our stay telling them about our celebrations and asking if they could just put a note on my husband's pillow ( 'The best husband in the world sleeps here') or something similar. They claimed not to have received my e mail and had no knowledge of a similar note added to our booking form and couldn't care less that our room and the lack of attention has spoiled the stay for me even before it started. I commented in a disappointed way rather than complain as I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my husband. But there was no apology-just defensiveness. We were rather begrudgingly given a free drink in the bar as compensation. The bar, however, ( Olivers) is fabulous-best martini ever. The staff here were friendly and delightful and the restaurant was great. The hotel is also very central-right next to the Westlake Centre and transport links. We made the best of the room as it was obvious that there was no point in commenting further and I didn't want to spoil our trip. But we came to the conclusion that The Mayflower does not want to know you unless you have paid top prices for their best rooms. We just felt as if we were there to fill the gap. Very, very disappointing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR43651019">My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel for our 1 yr anniversary. Overall, it was a good experience and I would probably go back there again. There were some things that could have been better. First, the positives: POSITIVES -Hotel is centrally located. You can walk to everything. -If you need to get a cab somewhere, the guys out front are the best. They are very friendly and will help with practically anything. -Clean rooms -one day we didn't even leave the room. Housekeeping called to check if we wanted our room cleaned and just asked that we let them know if we wanted towels or anything. -Good pressure and temp in the shower at any time of day. -Good WiFi. Just call down to the front desk for the password. NEGATIVES -the pillows were way too soft! my neck hurt by the end of the trip and we had too much stuff to travel with to bring my own pillow. this is just my opinion, though. -They got rid of the vending machines. You could either buy a $4 bottle of water in the room (not worth it), or hike it a few blocks to Ralph's market where you can buy the same water for half the price. -We went to eat at Oliver's lounge, attached to the hotel. The menu at the lounge was not the same as the one in the room and we ended up not being able to eat anything there. -no room service except for breakfast. -the bathroom is a little tight. the toliet is practially up against the wall. The negatives weren't a make or break thing for us and it's all just my personal preference. It's a nice hotel, I would just be prepared for these few things.<topic>none</topic>

My adult daughter was my travel partner and our deluxe room had two bathrooms and a wonderful view from the window. The amenities (robe, newspaper, coffee maker, safe, large screen TV, etc.) were great and a shopping mall was available through a connecting pass way.

Our room was on the small side but it was fine for us. It is an old historic hotel so one has to expect that. The room was very clean and nicely decorated with a great view of the city (9th floor). The location of the hotel was very convenient. We walked to Pike Place in minutes (every morning!), we walked to the Space Needle through Belltown, to Pioneer Square and Capitol Hill. The restaurant in the hotel, Andaluca, had a great breakfast menu (never made it there for dinner).

We buy the valet parking package, as we don't use our car while there and need to park for a couple of days. The hotel has an inviting and pretty lobby, and the staff are consistently helpful and friendly. The rooms are small -- hey, it's an old hotel! -- but they are well appointed and very clean. We requested a move due to street noise and were immediately accomodated. We usually don't eat here as there are more interesting places nearby. But this is a great place to relax and sleep, and sometimes the packages are good deals. The location is very good as well, close to the museums and waterfront.

<comment category="negative" id="UR39263252">We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel after our Alaskan Cruise. We stayed one night and flew out the next morning. The room was pretty but very small. We arrived early after getting off the cruise ship so we asked that our luggage be stored while we explored the city. We sat in the lobby for 25 minutes, eyeing our luggage that the staff stacked in a corner, unattended, hoping no one made off with it. No one seemed concerned about unattended luggage and it was totally ignored. I wouldn't leave until I made sure someone actually took the luggage and stored it. After 25 minutes, a bellhop finally came and got our luggage. We were going to go into the mall and ride the monorail but being this early on Sunday morning, the mall doors were still locked (it was about 10:30). So, we had to exit the hotel and walk to the monorail. When we got back, we checked in and our luggage was retrieved. Our room was pretty but nothing special. It actually wasn't much larger than our cabin on the cruise ship. It was comfortable, clean. Late that afternoon, after exploring Seattle, we decided to rest in our room. We looked in the hotel directory and my husband went to find a vending machine so we could enjoy a soft drink. There weren't any to be found. After calling the front desk we discovered the only way to obtain a soft drink was to go to the bar. We thought this was pretty bad for a hotel of this caliber not to have vending machines and force people to buy a soft drink at a high price in the bar. Needless to say, this did not endear us to this hotel. We've stayed at better hotels. Next time we'll stay at the Grand Hyatt.<topic>none</topic>

We have decided to make this an annual trip for the three of us. When we arrived at the desk we were informed that our guestroom had been upgraded to a suite on the top floor. We had a wonderful, restful visit to Seattle, including time to shop, enjoy some local restaurants and relax in our comfortable, spacious room.

<comment category="positive" id="UR37702920">My Fiancee and I started to plan our wedding and wanted to have it at a hotel, the only problem was we did not want to use standard Hilton, but wanted to find a place that had some charm and style, and on top of that a location that would handle all our wedding needs (planning, scheduling, etc..) we stopped by 3 different hotels in downtown seattle that were recommened by The Knot, two the hotels had the right charm but no customer service, plus they would not handle all our needs. That's when we met Andrew at The Mayflower Park hotel, the moment we met he was so open and friendly. He never said no to any of our question or request and the Hotel had the perfect 1920's style (done right). We decided this was the place to have our wedding, during the whole process Andrew was star, he always responded back to our question / issue ASAP, treated us as if we were his only clients, even though he had 3 other major events scheduled in July. Food was perfect, service was perfect we couldn't of asked for a better location or Hotel. If you are planning a wedding, please check out the Mayflower Park in Downtown Seattle, ask for Andrew and you will not be disappointed. Thanks again Andrew you made our wedding perfect, Becky told me she could not have dreamed of better wedding.<topic>none</topic>

We were forced to valet park since that was our only option. All the bellman were too busy talking to each - other to notice us. The door was very heavy and older people would have a large struggle to get in. At the front the desk everything was very dis-organized. The man at the front desk who seemed to young to be the manager was talking to the other agents while they were trying to check in people. The way he talked to people was quite rude. There was another young man who left the front desk to help with luggage and answer questions. The "business center" is a joke where you have to stand since there are no chairs and wait for your documents to be printed at the front desk . The rooms are dusty and old . I dont understand how this place got such great reviews since this is why I stayed here but obviously these people are used to an econo lodge or something. Out dated decorations , no gift shop or drinks to be bought on site. The olivers bar is nice .<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR36886000">We travel every year all over the world and this hotel is simply one of a kind. All the staff is friendly, helpful and great attitudes. They go far beyond what is expected. Hotel is beautiful, clean and feels like you are staying with family. Hotel is convenient to all attractions, I have visited seattle before but will always stay at the Mayflower from now on. What a wonderful experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR36817067">Stayed there at July 30 â€“ Aug 2. The location is great â€“ right downtown, walking distance to the most attractions, monorail was two blocks away and a bus stop was a block away. Our room was very small but clean. Bed was queen size and very comfortable. The interior is a bit outdated but we did not come to Seattle to spend our time in the room anyway. It was very hot in Seattle when we arrived. The very first day and night we had troubles with the air conditioner. The staff was very helpful; they checked our conditioner almost immediately and it was working more or less okay for the rest of our stay. It is a little pricey but we would go back. It is a nice place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35787482">My friends and I just returned from a trip to Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel and it was the most pleasant place I have ever stayed. We arrived and were upgraded to a double queen suites. That was wonderful because they had two baths in each suite. Our suites were very cozy and comfortable and clean . The hotel was all very beautiful and warm. We used the concierge, ate breakfast in the restaurant every morning and had drinks and some food in the lounge in the evening. Everyone there was so friendly and helpful in every way. The location is excellent for going to the waterfront, Pike's Market or going shopping. The tours we took picked us up at the hotel and brought us back there. If I ever return to Seattle I would definitely go back to the Mayflower Park Hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34299905">Stayed at the Mayflower with my wife while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Centre. Great location. Close enough to walk to the Centre but far enough to avoid running into attendees 24/7! Also close to a wide range of shopping tastes: Macy's, Nordstron, Banana Republic Payless and Ross Dress for Less for example. Some of the surroundings were a bit dingy (that park with the waterfall for example) but we never really felt threatened even though some unsavoury looking characters were always hanging around. Didn't spend much time in the hotel (out in the morning, back at night) but we did eat at Oliver's which was delightful and enjoyed watching a very amusing bartender give lessons to a visiting group. We were left alone, and that was fine. The room was always well made up and that was our main concern. Free wireless internet was great, so I could check my email at nights. No assistance provided on checkout (it was 4am and the staff did seem sleepy) but that was fine too. Saved a tip there. We would stay there again if we went back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33666821">The Mayflower Park was a great place to stay. It is 82 years old and the room are a bit smaller to match but definitely fine for a solo traveler. The service was impeccable. The location is great - four blocks from Pike Street Market, two from the Convention Center and right next to Macy's and Nordstroms if you are a shopper. The monorail connects right there if you want to go to the EMP or Space Needle. There are lots of other transit options right outside your door. Great stay - would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33507736">The Mayflower Park hotel is a "historic" hotel, so it may not have all of the amenities (flat screen tv, large bathroom) of a newer hotel, but it served our needs for a short three day trip to Seattle. It's just a few blocks from the market, so it was great to start the day with breakfast from one of the bakeries and overall very central to the typical tourist stops in Seattle. The staff was very friendly and the free wifi is always appreciated (and should be standard in hotels) - they also had two computers in the lobby for guests to use. We did not stop at the bar in the lobby, but it looked very inviting. Overall a nice stay. One other tip if you do not rent a car (and if you enjoy exploring cities on foot, a car is not necessary and saved us quite a bit of money in parking) - definitely consider the "Downtown Airporter" to/from the airport. The taxi ride is $40+ and the Airporter picks up at a hotel very close to this one and was only $11 per person.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32485671">We booked this hotel through Expedia.ca. Received an awesome rate of CDN$129. Rates for our room would usually go for over $200 a night. We think it was because we booked the room just for one night (Saturday) and just two days before we were in Seattle. They may have just been trying to fill the rooms. Upon our arrival, check-in was excellent. The front desk was extremely helpful, we used the valet service and it was $15 for 24 hours with unlimited in-out privileges. Considering that the hotel was on 4th Avenue. It was an awesome deal. When we got to our room, it was on the 11th floor (the hotel only has 12 floors), the front desk had booked us into a quiet corner suite and the room was immaculate. Others mention that it was smaller but for a married couple, it was just fine. The bed was comfortable, the sitting area with the TV and the desk with the mirror was helpful for putting on makeup since the bathroom didn't have much counterspace. The bathroom was small but had all the essentials. A good flowing shower, plenty of towels, complimentary products and bathrobes. We only stayed for one night so we didn't even use all the products but it was definitely great. Keep in mind, this hotel was built back in the 20's (i think) and it has been renovated a few times but the essence of the old-school style wasn't lost but it didn't feel dated or grungy at all, in fact, we felt like it was a great little getaway hotel that was close to the main downtown Seattle area. The lobby lounge, Oliver's, has really good martinies, they have won competitions for it. It was really nice also with the big windows and the high ceilings because you could watch people walking by and enjoy a tasty drink at the same time. A great before-dinner option. The concierge was extremely helpful, he gave us some options for how to spend the night and we gave him ideas of what we wanted to do and he gave us suggestions that fit it perfectly. The restaurant Andaluca's, we didn't go to but supposedly they have the best mediterranean, we will definitely check it out next time we visit. Overall, our stay at Mayflower was excellent. We would highly recommend. Even though it is rated 3.5 stars, it could be 4 stars for sure but since it is rated 3.5 i guess you are even more pleasantly surprised. And since it hasn't been taken over by any of the big hotel franchises, you can go away feeling like you have really supported the local businesses. Me and my husband can't wait to go back to Mayflower Park!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32421360">Almost perfect but the housekeeper needs to look more closely in lower and corner areas. A great location. We had a deluxe queen/queen with plenty of room. I would recommend a higher level because of local construction. The fitness area only had two treadmills.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR30558350">I stayed at the Mayflower during a conference in March. I got conference rates, which were not extremely inexpensive, but also not full rates. Overall my experience was positive. The location is very good... it's attached to a shopping mall that also houses a station of the Seattle Monorail -- I didn't ride the Monorail, but it was extremely convenient because you can get into the mall and to the station all indoors, by going through a back hallway of the hotel. However, I mostly walked everywhere, because the hotel was at the most just a few blocks from everywhere I wanted to go. Although the decor in the room was a little dated, it was not what I would call shabby -- and the room was kept very clean. And I loved the botanical art on the walls of the room (that type of art is one of my favorites). So many hotels have very unremarkable art hanging in the rooms -- this was a step above the usual, in my opinion. Some people don't care much about art, though, so take that comment with a grain of salt if you are that type. The service in this hotel was excellent. I stayed 4 nights and rarely had to call for anything, but when I did my concerns were addressed promptly. This hotel is not part of a chain. It has been locally owned for over 30 years. That is fairly rare in most urban hotels these days. My room was not noisy at all. I could never hear much from the neighboring rooms, even though I knew there was somebody in there. And I could not hear traffic noise at all. I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR30224893">'tis a grand old place with none of the quirks and problems you often find in older hotels. It's is modern in all of the important ways - baths, climate control, elevators, WiFi - all very nice and well maintained. Terrific staff, especially the valets. The bar is noted for their martinis and for good reason - best I've had. Location adjacent to a mall is convenient and the monorail is just upstairs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR29118074">Stayed with three friends in one of the quadruple rooms. Beautiful hotel, super friendly staffs, and excellent location! 8 min walk to the public market and 10 min walk to the convention center made it very easy to enjoy Seattle while spending bulk of daytime in the convention center. Recommend Public Market, restaurants and coffee shops on first avenue, Washington state ferry from Pier 52, and monorail to Seattle center to Experience Music Project (Jimi Hendrix!). Also easy walk to Capitol hill to enjoy excellent pasta (Cafe Marchavelli) and honey lavendar ice cream. Our safe didn't function well and wifi internet was slow, but otherwise it was a superb stay. Will definitely stay again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR27733912">Cleanliness: Broken tiles, dust, some film in the bathroom... It wasn't bad but not great either. Service: Friendly and helpful from the bellboy to the front desk. They gladly held our luggage when we needed and valet was polite and efficient. Location: Great as it is right downtown Seattle so in walking distance or short ride away from all major attractions. Value: I booked through Priceline so got a good deal but that also came at a price (see rooms below). Rooms: I think because we got a good deal that we were also given the most terrible room in the building. Firstly, the room is completely dated - it looks and feels as though it was built in the early 1950s. TV is old, bathrooms were small and dingy looking with terrible looking tiles and a very small tub, plumbing could use some work as the water was either too hot or too cold and made a lot of noise when showering, carpets seemed ingrained with dirt, small room and the only window we had was facing the air conditioning vent and nothing else. We could barely see skies outside our window. I would never wish this kind of room on anyone. We even switched hotels after one night since we couldn't believe this is what we paid for. I would recommend to stay away from this hotel if possible. I don't know how people could give this place 5 stars when it is just so old and outdated. Staff are very friendly but the rooms were just atrocious.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26955301">I was quite happy at the Mayflower and would stay there again either on business or leisure. It had a lot of historic charm while still being clean and up to date. Some of the complaints are true--there is some noise from traffic outside (though it definitely dies down at night and if you are particularly sensitive, ear plugs would do the trick), no real counter space in the bathroom, no fancy flat screen tv--but the location (an easy walk to the Market, the monorail, and to Dahlia's-yum!), the comfortable pretty room with nice beds and towels, and the excellent service overrode these minor problems. The front desk and the room service waiters were particularly friendly and thoughtful. I had a deluxe room which was plenty spacious; however, the regular rooms I poked my head in, while still nice, were definitely smaller--I'd recommend springing for the deluxe--the rate was only slightly higher.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26886401">Stayed in a corner suite and was well worth it. This hotel gave us a great AAA discount, otherwise couldn't have afforded it. So be sure to ask. Even with this discount, we were treated with superior service. Arrived before check-in, so they held our bags as we did sight seeing. The desk staff helped us check in for our flights, reserved transportation to airport and even helped "weigh" our bags to make sure they weren't too heavy to check on the airplane. They recommended restaurants and brought us extra terry robes for lounging in our room. Even the clerk who took my reservation weeks earlier was very helpful and explained details of the room and said often the corner suites have a view so I requested a view. We ended up with a super view of the Space Needle. We had 5 people in our group so had one room with 2 double beds, which were very comfortable, and a large sitting room (where we opened a cot at night) with bar and TV and the excellent views. The TV in the bedroom didn't work but one in the sitting room was fine. Best of all we had 2 bathrooms which is great with a group. This is a good location to get to Pike's Place Market (about 4 blocks) and to catch the monorail (right around corner) to the Space Needle. Also close to shopping, the Nordstrom Rack, and a food court in the mall (good for teenagers), and of course coffee shops. Around the corner was a courtyard in front of an office building with a band playing during lunch hour. Wouldn't walk around this area too late at night. Came back from eating at Etta's after dark and was glad we were in a group. We have paid a lot more $$ for a lot less in service and quality so with our great experience at this hotel and we would definately stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR25815680">I had always intended to stay at 3 hotels either side of a conference at Microsoft in Bellevue so I could see which one I wanted to stay at on my next visit. I booked my first night at the Mayflower Park as I needed an address for the visa waiver form, however I had to move rooms as soon as I arrived due to noise, despite requesting a quiet room on the booking and again during the check in. The second room was adequate however it faced the street so there was some noise and the room was fairly small, dingy and rather dated in a shabby kind of way rather than quaint. The TV was very small and looked about 20 years old with poor fuzzy reception and poor range of channels. I did not try the restaurant so cannot comment on this. On a positive note the hotel is in a great location which would be difficult to beat. In short the hotel is ok however it was not a tough decision to try another hotel and I would not stay at the Mayflower again unless my first choice (The Vintage Park) was not available.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR25610741">Stayed three nights, in a corner suite on the 12th floor. If you want restful sleep with little neighbor noise, this is the way to go. Because the suite literally was a corner of the hotel and my little living room was one on side of it, I had no bedroom walls that adjoined neighboring rooms. I know I had neighbors because I saw housekeeping cleaning their room, but I never once heard them. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff did NOT knock on my door at the crack of dawn, and they DID restock my little complimentary toiletries without me having to ask. I would absolutely stay here again, in the same suite. The restaurant, Andaluca, was wonderful. My only complaint there was that it was closed Monday AND Tuesday. Several minor little things...not much counter space in the bathroom, at all. And when they tell you room service is served 24 hours...that means you can get a fruit or deli plate any time. No hot food after 10. The windows only opened about three inches. Another hotel was being built fairly close by, and construction noise started around 0800 each day. But, hey, I wasn't there to sleep in. Everything that mattered to me (comfy bed, peace and quiet, great staff, convenient location) I got.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR25507814">This is a truly lovely hotel. The staff was excellent. Greg, the bartender in Oliverâ€™s Lounge, is a show unto himself. Go and have a martini just to watch him work. Heâ€™s unstoppable; a fabulous worker and fun to watch. The hotel is clean, the beds comfortable, and the ambience is relaxing and romantic. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this for families but definitely for a romantic getaway or a peaceful business trip. The only issue I had is that there was a small closet in our deluxe room and the bathroom was tight (e.g., the toilet roll holder was practically in my eye!). There was room for a small toiletry cabinet, but they didnâ€™t embellish, so there was no counter space. Aside from these issues, some of which are easy fixes, I would absolutely recommend this hotel. Excellent location, too!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24420694">My husband and I stayed one night as a short, romantic getaway. The hotel could not have been better. We had a package that included parking, breakfast, chocolate and champagne, and late check out. I felt welcomed and pampered from the moment we pulled up. Check in was quick, the room was beautiful, the chocolates were great and breakfast fantastic. Everytime I turned around someone wanted to open a door or carry my bags, but without being intrusive. My favorite was the bell hop who saw me waiting at the desk to ask about cab companies. He asked what I needed and then went out the valet to get the name and number of a cab company for me (we wanted it for coming back to the hotel later.) There was none of the "it's not my job" attitude, just a desire to please. I will be back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23750872">A bit out of date but we stayed at the Mayflower Park Hotel on two separate occassions during August 2008. We stayed here on our first and last nights of our three week holiday and both times this hotel was excellent! Both times we had a room on one of the upper floors with excellent views across Seattle. The rooms were a good size with a double bed, seat, desk and chair, TV cabinet and TV. The beds were very comfortable and we had a great night sleep on both evenings with little or no noise. We had breakfast in the hotel during our first stay and the food was good but we felt it was a little bit expensive so choose to eat out the second stay. If we went back to Seattle we would definately stay at this hotel again as the location was fantastic (five mins walk from Pike Place) and we felt it was good value for money.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23044573">This is an older hotel so the rooms are not large. Bathroom was a little on the small side, as was the TV. Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower. The bed in our room was very comfortable -- better than your average 3* hotel bed -- &amp; they also provided bathrobes. We stayed during a snowstorm so we really appreciated the fact that the hotel has a good restaurant (Andalucia -- Spanish tapas) with excellent food &amp; reasonable prices. There's also quite a good bar. We found the staff to be very friendly &amp; helpful, plus the hotel is in a great location right in the center of Seattle.

<comment category="positive" id="UR21875502">My husband and I spent 3 nights in this excellent and charming hotel during the first part of November and were delighted with our experience there. Selene, the extremely professional representative who assisted me with my reservation, couldn't have been more helpful. I told her it was a special occasion (my birthday) and she offered us a luxurious, corner location, two room suite, complete with two bathrooms, perfect view of the space needle, and even the deep red decor I was hoping for. Every single employee we encountered focused on making our stay as special as possible, beginning with the cheerful, very knowledgeable Bridgitte who greeted us at the front desk and went out of her way to ensure we had every detail we might need to add to our comfort. This hotel also has an excellent restaurant, Andaluca, where we ate breakfast in the mornings. Afternoon rest stops were spent in Oliver's, a very cozy, intimate bar filled with light from an enormous wall of windows overlooking the Seattle street scene and offering superb drinks and delicious menu items. The Mayflower Park is also located just four blocks from Pike Place Market, which enabled us to walk to every location we wanted to visit while in town, from restaurants to shopping to the theatre. It's also connected to the monorail, which makes it effortless to whiz to the Space Needle for dinner. For those of you looking for a beautifully furnished, timeless and intimate boutique hotel located in the heart of downtown and providing superb service, food and ambience, I can't say enough about selecting the Mayflower Park for your next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21829131">A business trip to Seattle brought me to the Mayflower Park hotel for two nights. Although I had lived in Seattle for much of my life, I'd never noticed the place or (amazingly enough) been to Andaluca or the hotel bar. Overall, this was a fine place to stay; it's a solid downtown hotel. LOCATION The hotel is centrally located, at 4th and Olive. Although I didn't do much sightseeing, it's walking distance from a number of Seattle attractions. Close to the Market, close to the Waterfront, close to Westlake... you get the idea. Mind you, central location does have its occasional downside as well. There's a lot of traffic on the surrounding streets, and I did notice a little traffic noise in my room. It didn't bother me, but if you're sensitive to that, you might want to look elsewhere. ROOMS I stayed in a Deluxe guestroom (a step up from the Classic), which had plenty of room and a nice configuration. There was a large bar area that had the coffee maker and a sink, which was nice to have. The workstation was large and functional, perfect if you need to work on the road. The bathroom was small an unspectacular, but nicely appointed and perfectly functional. I'm not a huge fan of Queen Anne Style (as the hotel describes their decor), but it seemed pretty understated and didn't bother me. There was no noise from other rooms or the hallway, but there was some early-morning street noise. Know your tolerance for traffic noise and plan accordingly. FACILITIES/LOBBY The lobby is small, but nicely appointed. Not much to say about it. Oliver's, the bar, is a good place to have a drink, and always looked inviting when I returned to the hotel. Bar help was friendly and they have Pike Place Ale on tap, always a plus for me. Aside from WiFi, I didn't use the business facilities, so I'm not sure what they're like. There's also a workout room, which I never found time to use. RESTAURANT I ate at the very chic-looking Andaluca the first night I was there and was very pleased. I sat at the small bar in the restaurant and got great service. If you like shellfish, don't miss the baked mussels; they were stunningly good, and went really well with a glass of Spanish bubbly. I wanted to go back the second night but had already made other dinner plans. I'll go back when I get the chance. STAFF Hotel staff was helpful and tolerant of my questions and occasional mishaps (like losing my room key). I'd describe the help as professional if slightly aloof in some instances -- not a problem for me, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by warmth. Bar and restaurant staff were professional, attentive, and friendly. SUMMARY If you're looking for a decent hotel in a great downtown location, this should fit the bill. The restaurant and bar are the strong points, although everything was certainly better-than-acceptable. For a two-night business trip, the location and amenities were just what I needed, and the stay was uneventful. I'd rate it at the lower end of "above average"<topic>none</topic>

For families, it's close to the pike's place market. For hipsters, it's close to Belltown. It's located on the same block as a popular mall and corporate shopping. For those who plan to hit center city, the monorail is conveniently right next door. All staff was helpful, polite, and professional. We were able to check in early with no problems.

<comment category="positive" id="UR21007589">My husband and I decided to take a long weekend in Seattle. Having never been there, I read a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor and selected the Mayflower Park Hotel for our stay at the recommendations of many. It was great! Our flights came in very early and left really late, but they were able to accommodate an early check in and a late check out with no problems. I had booked their Rise and Shine package, so we had a delicious breakfast sent up to our room every morning. And it's true what others say---Olivers is great! We enjoyed their cocktails (especially the infused Bloody Mary) each night before having dinner in town. The front desk staff and concierge was very helpful and polite. We got a room on the 12th floor in the corner, so we had great views. Although the room was smaller than an average sized hotel room, it suit our needs perfectly. Also, at the suggestion of others on tripadvisor we took the Downtown Airporter through Grayline for $18 each, roundtrip. It picked up/dropped off at the Westin less than 2 minutes away from the Mayflower Park. This was a super easy alternative to taking a cab from the airport/downtown. We had considered renting a car, but glad we didn't in the end. Everything was easy to get to without a car. Location wise the hotel was perfect for our needs. We walked to the Pikes Place Market everyday. Also, having the monorail and Westlake Center (food court/shopping) attached to the hotel made travel to Seattle Center easy. We celebrated one night with dinner at the Space Needle restaurant. It is overpriced as other say, but it was worth the experience and views. Plus you have to consider the $16 per person you'd spend just to go up it, so it worked out! We also went on the Savory Seattle Food tour through The Pikes Place Market and it was great! Well worth the time and money. Overall, we had a great trip to Seattle and the Mayflower Park Hotel is probably the biggest reason why! Thanks to everyone on Tripadvisor for your suggestions!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20402829">This is a well managed historic hotel in a good downtown location, convenient to mass transportation, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, a Great location to use as a base to explore Seattle. We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights at the beginning of a 10 day trip to the Puget Sound area and returned for the last two nights. Our first room was a very nice large deluxe room on an upper floor with a king bed and sitting area with sofa, two chairs and coffee table. We slept with the window open a couple of inches and were not bothered by street sounds. Rooms in Seattle were scarce at the end of our trip, so we emailed the hotel after getting the first reservation and were able to get a smaller room, about the size of a standard Marriott room, with two queen beds and two bathrooms on a lower floor at the same price. Both were very nice rooms, great for sleeping with good maid service, but being an historic building, the bathrooms were smaller than bathrooms found in newer properties. The front desk staff provided good recommendations for dining and were extremely pleasant. On the evening of our arrival we had a light meal and drinks in Oliverâ€™s, the hotel lounge. The food and service was good. Preferring a light breakfast, we used coffee shops and cafes out of the hotel. We opted to pick up our rental car at a downtown location at the end of our 1st two nights, preferring to explore large cities on foot and eliminated both the valet parking and airport rental car concession fees. Gray Line Downtown Airporter bus service ($18pp roundtrip) from SeaTac to the nearby Weston Hotel worked well and we walked the two blocks to the Mayflower Park. Being at the end of the Monorail to Seattle Center was a plus and we also took advantage of the free daytime downtown public bus, using the nearby underground bus tunnel. There are many things to see and do in Seattle. This hotel worked well for us and we would definitely use it again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20375276">The Mayflower Park had attentive service and a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and attached to the Westlake Mall where you can access the monorail. We opted for the deluxe room to gain a little more area and were glad we did. We had a corner room with 3 windows on 2 walls and we had lots of light. As high as we were, it was surprising to still be able to hear the traffic so well. I guess we were tired enough at night that it did not really turn into an issue. The bathroom is very small with a pedestal sink. A small glass shelf above the sink is where I removed my contacs and I really prefer a vanity area. I estimated about 20 inches at the most between the sink and tub. The bathroom was definitely my least favorite thing about the room. The elevators were unbelievably slow and we spent a lot of time during our several day stay waiting on them. I think this might be a better one night stay place with a good rate from a Priceline type internet booking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20293921">We stayed at The Mayflower Hotel on Saturday, September 13th, the night before we left for our Alaskan cruise. The rooms are not large, but we were extremely happy with the room. The decor was very classic and the beds super comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel. It's just a short couple blocks to the Market which we visited in the afternoon. The monorail to the Space Needle is attached to the hotel which is extremely convenient. That evening we walked back down to the Market area for dinner and again in the morning before our flight for breakfast.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20291198">I am currently staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel. My husband, son and I stayed here the first night after arriving in Seattle. We have returned to stay two nights more at the end of our travels, before flying out of Sea-Tac airport. Contact the hotel directly for a rate, as we got a cheaper one going through them directly rather than online... (AAA discount) The Mayflower is a nice, older, hotel right in the heart of downtown Seattle. I have to add that there are many hotels near this location most very expensive, and just 6 blocks away are a few that are cheaper...anything cheaper than the Mayflower will land you in a much less desirable location. The Mayflower is a very old building that has been renovated in the 90's, yet is is still very clean, the decor is like saying at a fancy mother in laws house....The single bedroom is very small but for a night it is fine, the three of us barely fit with luggage and a portacrib.. This second time we are in a delux queen room (they upgraded us for free) it is a great size for the three of us. The bathrooms in both of our rooms have been very nice, clean, tiny, but tastefully done. The front desk is really warm and friendly, and the restaurant and bar on site are great too. Hope you enjoy it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19337468">This is the best location in downtown Seattle. It is also the best priced hotel for this class of hotel in downtown. I use to live in Seattle and always walked by this hotel and would look in through the large window where the bar is located and would always want to go inside. It has a warm and inviting look to it and I was not one bit disspointed. First of all, the staff is excellent. From the valet that greets you when you drive up, to the front desk personnel, and the personnel that maintains the rooms, everyone is superb. The room was very nice with great beds and wonderful bed linens. The bathroom is a bit small but this is the price you pay for staying in an older hotel in the heart of downtown. The small bathroom was a small sacrifice considering the hotel has rooms with two queen size beds and is located on the same block as Westlake center and is only a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The rooms are also beautifully renovated and the property does not show its age. As I mentioned, you could not get a better location. It is located on the same block as Westlake Center. From here you can take the monorail to the Seattle Center. Nordstrom is only a block away and Pike Place is about three blocks away. I finally did go to the beautiful bar inside the hotel I use to look at years ago as I walked by and it was wonderful. They have some great drinks on the menu and you can order food here as well. We only had breakfast in the hotel's restaurant and it was excellent.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18470528">We stayed at this hotel on the first night of our Seattle &amp; Vancouver trip and was pleasantly surprised by it. The place is a European style hotel (in furnishings and size), but it was quite confortable and clean. It was also a good value overall compared to other hotels of this caliber--just be sure to check their website for special packages. Ours included the room, valet parking (which is normally a crazy $30/night--normal for downtown, though), and a $20 gas card for each night. The front desk person and manager didn't have my change to this certain package from just a room and were inflexible about giving it to me at first. That was pretty disappointing, but we got a call a couple of hours later stating that they would give us it afterall. The location was superb--VERY close to delicious Dahlia Lounge(for dinner) and Lola (for breakfast--have the Greek scramble). It is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and it sounded like an attached monorail ride to the Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18350824">We really enjoyed the Mayflower Park Hotel. From our check-in to our check-out the staff was outstanding the Hotel beautifully maintained. Our original room had only one hight stand and reading light and we asked for a different room. Robert the desk clerk ,was very acomodating and cheked around until he found a room that would work. The Hotel is a Historic Hotel of America and is truly a gem. The location is fantastic. It is connected to a shopping center, however, the entrance is so hidden that yo would not know it was there. The monorail station is in the center so it is very convenient to get to the Space Needle. You can walk to restaurants and shopping. We actually stayed here 2 times on our trip. One night on our way to the Jan Juans, and 2 nights after we returned. We had 2 different rooms and both were beautifully appointed with all the amenities. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18285259">The Mayflower Park is an excellent choice for price, location, friendly knowledgeable staff etc. My wife and I stayed in their "classic room" ( Room 1106) this is a corner room looking out 4th and mall area. If someone travels with a lot of baggage, then I would suggest a larger room. Otherwise the room was clean and sufficient for two people. We visited a couple larger hotels, but found them not as relaxing and people everywhere. It was like being out in the streets in their lobby's. Bottom line folks...we would happily make another reservation at the Mayflower Park!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18147029">We had not been to Seattle in a few years and we wanted to find an nice hotel in downtown that was reasonably priced. The Mayflower Park met all these criteria. So we took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle (a great ride in both directions) and checked in at the Mayflower. When we checked in, the front desk got us a very quiet room that actually had two separate bathrooms (it was nice to be able to spread out). The service was excellent throughout and we got some good tips from the concierge on what to do and where to eat. The location was excellent, a few blocks away from the Pike Street Market and right at the termini of both the monorail and the new streetcar to Lake Union. In addition, downtown buses are free so we only needed a taxi once (after a tiring day and evening on the waterfront).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17709911">Got a room via HOTWIRE for the 1st week in July 08. Iâ€™m not sure what sort of room they would call it, but it was probably the standard accommodation for 2 people. It was small yet efficient. Perfect for a one-night stay, but probably better to opt for a bigger room if staying longer. Also, the dÃ©cor is traditional â€“ not the usual modern or contemporary that Iâ€™d prefer. The bathroom was tiny but the water pressure okay. The location was ideal. Walking distance to several of the downtown attractions. Concierge, check-in/out and bellhop service was efficient and professional. Although I donâ€™t have any complaints about this hotel, Iâ€™d probably opt to stay elsewhere only because the dÃ©cor of the room did not suit me.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17188746">Our party of 5 stayed here in two rooms for one night after disembarking from our cruise. I called from the pier at 8am to see if we could check our luggage in the lobby while we wandered around Seattle's downtown since I knew we could not check into our room until 3 or 4pm. Much to my surprise, they told me one of our rooms was available so they were happy to check us in. We arrived by taxi at 9am and checked into that room. The other room was ready by Noon, and they contacted me by cell phone to let me know we were free to pick up our other room card when we were ready. One person in our party is recovering from knee surgery, and was limping quite pronouncedly after overdoing it on an excursion the day before. The hotel staff made known to me that they do have a wheelchair on the property and said they would be happy to get it out of storage if we could use it. I thought that was a great idea, but my relative said no and opted to walk a little bit and then rest in the room while the rest of us adventured. Pike's Place Market was an easy 3 blocks away, and the monorail stop is just a block away. The 2nd floor of the hotel links to the Westlake Center Mall which we enjoyed, and there is lots of shopping available around this hotel's location. We had one room with 1 queen bed, and another room with 2 queen beds. Both were clean, with comfortable beds. The 2-queen room had a flat screen TV while the 1-queen room had a normal model. Both had desks with chairs, cozy sitting chairs, and free wireless connection. The shower/bath was great with plenty of hot water and terrific pressure. The decor is very charming, and it was quiet--we never heard any noise from neighbors or otherwise. One of us ate in Andaluca for breakfast (opens at 6:30am) and it was nice but pricey ($11-16). The rest opted for Starbuck's which is only a half block down 4th Ave. For lunch, we loved P.F. Chang's which was just around the corner. We enjoyed our stay very much, and would like to return when we have more time to spend in Seattle. All the staff, from the desk attendants to the bellmen to the concierge, were very warm and responsive to our questions and needs. Wonderful experience!<topic>none</topic>

Easy walking distance to Pike Market, Belltown and only about a 10-minute walk to Capitol Hill. Rooms are pretty basic, but we booked a good rate (average of $209/night) from Friday night to Tuesday. Never ate at the restaurant but the hotel does a have a limited 24-hour room service menu. Ultimately, great location for a very walkable city.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16821890">My husband and I stayed at the Mayflower Park for the first two nights of our Seattle/Portland trip last August. We were attracted to the property for its central location and moderate prices. Although we preferred other hotels on our 10-day trip, we were overall pleased with our stay at the Mayflower Park. For the rates we paid, it was a decent value for downtown Seattle. The location truly is the best selling feature of the hotel. We were able to easily walk to all the major downtown attractions, even the Space Needle. The attached mall with the monorail stop, was a great convenience. Pike Place is a short downhill jaunt and the fabulous Tom Douglas eateries are scattered throughout the area (Palace Kitchen and Dahlia Lounge/Bakery are not to be missed). The front desk was staffed by friendly, attentive service professionals. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. We had a mixed experience with the doormen/bellmen/valet staff that lounge in the entrance. Doors were opened and held sporadically and conversations among the bellmen apparently took priority over guest service. Yes, the elevators are slow, but this was nothing we had a problem with. We had a king size corner room with couch and side chair seating area on the 9th floor. We had no issues with street noise, and enjoyed the view of the city. The room was a perfectly comfortable for two. The bed could have been a bit more plush. The mattress was just okay and could be due for replacement. The bathroom was a good size and was tucked around the corner, giving the room a nice layout and a break from cookie-cutter, chain hotels. I really admire the work that was done to save a preserve this historic property. However, the entire place needs a cosmetic freshening. The brass dÃ©cor and linens feel solidly late 80â€™s/early 90â€™s. A total overhaul isnâ€™t necessary, just an upgrade in bedding and furniture.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16751923">Don't book online, call them direct. I booked online and unbeknownst to me I got a single queen room, but needed 2 beds. Jeffery and the manager helped us out by giving us a great 2 queen room with TWO bathrooms. We were on the 12th floor and it had a fantastic view. Bathrooms were clean and the room was perfect. It was a very quiet room, slept great. We had a cosmo in Olivers to celebrate the film "Sex and the City" premiere and had lunch in the restaurant. The risotto was the best I've ever had. Perfect location, Macy's is across the street, Nordies 2 blocks away. We walked everywhere and shopped our selves silly. Pikes Place Market is a few blocks away and is a full of shops, places to eat, the original Starbucks, FIsh and Flowers. Artists of all sorts have set up shop there as well. We flew in to SEATAC, bussed for 12 bucks to the Westin, then walked to Mayflower park with our rolling suitcases. not a problem. Seattle airport is very big, ask for help when navigating it. I want to go back cause I loved Seattle and want to see more of it, will stay in the Mayflower Park again. Everyone who worked there was wonderful and nice. Bellmen were great and helped us out with suggestions and directions.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10075451">Stayed here with my company one night following an off-site meeting. The location is great- within walking distance of the Seattle Center (and Space Needle), Pike Place Market, Pacific Place (shopping center), and adjoining to Westlake Center. The monorail stop is really close. We were in a corner room on the 7th floor, and I thought it was a reasonable size. The bed was comfortable and the room had a good view of downtown Seattle streets. Furniture and overall decorating scheme were nice enough, but I think the carpet and bathrooms could use updating. The bathroom sink was nice, but the tub looked a bit ancient and not really in a cute historical way. However, the service was GREAT and everyone was nice. Valet parking was free, and when I realized I had forgotten a toothbrush, I was brought one (and toothpaste) within 5 minutes. Also, I didn't use it, but there was free wireless internet. A lot of hotels nickel and dime you, so it was nice to not have that happen. One strange thing was...we had oatmeal raisin cookies at our work meeting, and I found olives in mine...not sure if that was on purpose or not but GROSS!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8240588">Well, the lobby is nice!! That's about all I can say that's positive. Our room was tiny and extremely noisy. We could hear every word in the conversation next door. Our bathroom was outdated, no room for our toiletries or anything else. So was the elevator... very slow and guests had to share the elevator with waiters, cleaning staff and maintenance staff carrying all kinds of equipment, etc., etc. One computer for the whole hotel, and NO privacy when using computer, staff sits right behind you looking at your computer screen!! Hotel is also right next to a park filled with homeless people. What more can I say... we were disappointed to say the least, and I would skip this place at all cost if returning to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8131588">I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. But the place does have its pluses and minuses. Positives- 1) Great service- as far as bellhops/valet, and housekeeping go. Getting the car was relatively quick, never a long wait (and supposedly the hotel was fully booked the time we were there) The room was always cleaned on a timely basis. One time we thought we lost our phone (after we had already come up the room) so the valet searched our car for us and even pulled our car up and helped us look for it again. 2) Location-Short walk to Pike Place Market and connected to the Westlake Center (monorail/stores/food court) 3) The king suite was spacious with a refrigerator and wet bar (convenient to bring back drinks since there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid about 2 blocks away), 2 tv's, and 2 thermostats (one for the bedroom and one for the sofa area) Negatives- 1) Noise level-note from the other rooms but from the street below (Our room sat right at the corner of Olive and 4th) I don't know how it is from the higher floors (the hotel is only 12 stories tall) but being on the lower floors you will defintely hear road noise from buses and cars (worse if you open the window). If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room. The noise didn't bother me but I didn't need an alarm in the morning with all the buses passing by. 2)No safe in the room-I though all hotels had one 3)Only 2 elevators-Not really a big deal, but they are slow and the staff also use the same elevators so at times you will wait (but again not too bad unless you're impatient) and the elevator are on the small side 4)Not stroller friendly-there are 2 entrances into the hotel one of which is a flight of like 10 steps (the main entrance)so you have to use the other entrance on the other side. And the connection to the Westlake Center is on the Mezzanine Level where you also have to go up about 15 stairs. (and again the elevator is small. 5)Less chance of getting a good view-Remember there are only 12 floors and I think you have to be on the upper floors if you want to see the water or Space Needle. Compared to the Westin across the street which is super tall and I'm sure you have a better chance of getting a better view (I'm not too much into views so I was okay with looking at the street) Overall I was very pleased with the room and the hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8069931">My boyfriend &amp; I only had one night to stay in Seattle on our vacation to the Pacific NW. At first I was crushed because I had my heart set on the Inn at the Market &amp; they were full. I knew I wanted to stay close to the Pike Street Market &amp; I booked the Mayflower Park unsure of its proximity. It turned out to be perfect- well located in the downtown area, it was just a couple minutes walk from the Fairmont, Triple Door, and the Market. Plus, if you like shopping, Macy's is just across the street. We checked in relatively early (around 10 am) and the kind clerk informed us that he did have *a* room available but it was on a low floor; however, if we didn't mind waiting, he could get us on the 12th floor (highest). IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!! We had a perfect view of the Space Needle from our window! I booked a corner queen room because I read about the necessary extra room (only $7 extra with the AAA discount)- it was big enough for the two of us, esp just for one night. The bathroom wasn't much smaller than any other average hotel bathroom- a little aged, but fully functional. I liked the overall character of this historic hotel.

<comment category="positive" id="UR8034459">My sister and I spent one night in Seattle a few weeks ago at the Mayflower Park Hotel after an Alaskan cruise. I do a LOT of research before I book a hotel and I found that the Mayflower had some rooms with two queen beds and two baths. It could not have been more perfect for two women traveling together! Although they couldn't guarantee us that type of room, they did honor our request. We were across the street from Nordstoms and all the downtown shopping and just a few blocks from the Pike Place Market. I don't think we could have been in a better location. I thought the lobby was much nicer than in the hotel's pictures on the web sites and the bar off the lobby was beautiful, on the corner of the street with lots of paned windows and atmosphere. Great spot for a nightcap. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, nice linens and toiletries; all in all we had a great experience. I had read that there was a lot of construction downtown, but we really didn't notice any. One last thing, there are buses on 1st street that are free and we caught a bus down to the old area of Seattle called Pioneer Square and took an underground tour in the afternoon. It was only a couple of hours but very interesting to learn about Seattle's history.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7989881">This place was great! We thought because of the price, smaller size and age of the hotel we would have a slightly out of date "historic" hotel waiting for us - HOWEVER, when we walked in we where thrilled to find a beautifully updated hotel. The location is perfect for Pikes Market and other downtown shopping and dinning within walking distance. Our room was just right and very up to date and the bathroom spotless. The staff were extremely nice. From the doormen, valet, desk clerk to the concierge. Everyone was helpful and professional. The concierge reccommened excellent restaurants within walking distance and within minutes we had resservations and the local movie theater times printed and in our hands.

<comment category="negative" id="UR7803760">Stayed at the Mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on June 5 and 6th. Advice to meeting planners: Think twice of having a meeting if over 70 participants will be at your function. The hotel was overwhelmed. Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane. As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont. While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet. Your car could be blocks away. Oh, by the way, they charge $28.00 a day.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7790972">We were a group of six staying for two nights before our Alaskan cruise. Our room was spacious but the bathroom was tiny (typical for older hotels). The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful but we were misinformed by the conceirge and bellman on more than one occassion. Our room was quiet but another couple traveling with us said their room was extremely noisy from the street traffic. We were on the same floor but around the corner from them. I didn't find the bed to be very comfortable as I've read in previous reviews. But I may be bias as I have a tempurpedic bed at home so it is difficult for me to find comfortable beds when traveling. The monorail station in the mall attached to the hotel is convenient but beware that it only travels to the space needle and back, there are no other stops. The restaurant attached to the hotel has great breakfast with excellent service. Seattle is a great city and I would love to travel there again. I might check out a different hotel just to have variety but I'd recommend this hotel to friends or family.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7640116">If you are planning a weekend trip to Seattle, Mayflower Hotel is the place to stay. The location of this historic hotel can't be better. You will be within 5 to 10 walking minutes to everything you should see in Seattle. Places like, Seattle's famous Fresh Market with the most amazing fresh seafood, produce, beautiful flowers and fantastic restaurants; the Underground, Space Needle, Seattle's Waterfront views and you won't even need to exit to the street to take a ride on a Monorail because it is connected with the hotel building. Also this hotel has a complimentary valet parking which is a huge plus considering that all other hotels in the Downtown area charge $25-$30 per night. The rooms are clean and comfortable, a very nice staff. The hotel has a restaurant and a martini bar on the first floor for those who would like to relax after a long day of sightseeing. During your stay in Seattle I would recommend to take one of the Argosy Lock Cruises- itâ€™s really fun and memorable. Here is the link to their website so you can book your tickets in advance. www.argosycruises.com If this is your first time in Seattle, you are going to fall in love with this city!

We boooked this hotel because it was near everything we were interested in. Check in-I'd called ahead and told the front desk I was a light sleeper and would like a quiet room. I had a nice conversation with the girl and she said no problem, but when I arrived at my room, it was right next to the elevator. I went straight back and explained the problem. First I was told there were no other rooms, so I asked if I could pay extra for an upgraded room and I was told there were none. Finally I was given a quieter room, but with a view of a ugly brick wall. I made my request when I booked four months prior and called to confirm two days ahead so this shouldn't have been an issue. Room-Very small but perfect for just me. I did find myself feeling abit closed in. The bath towels could have been nicer. The bed was fine. I slept great every night but better linens are always a plus-maybe Mayflower Park should invest in some. The walls were also very thin. The housekeeping staff was wonderful. Had drinks and Bar snacks downstairs-wonderful and room service breakfast one day-wonderful and quick. I gave this above average because I would stay again and I enjoyed the experience of a smaller hotel and not a big chain. I also was really close to everything I wanted. We walked constantly, Pike's Market, Pioneer Square (Teri Lyn at Bill Speidels Underground tour was the best), Capitol Hill, all the shops and restaurants in the CBD, ferries, etc. I think this hotel is great for single travelers that enjoy something a little more elegant but keep in mind it is an old people with very thin walls.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7394131">Mayflower Park Hotel is a great choice if you want something equidistant between the Space Needle and the basball/football arenas, as I did. The needle is definitely walkable. The stadiums are too, but are much longer. Definitely leave 30-40 minutes for that walk. Another thing that's very close is Pike Place Market. It's only a few blocks away. Also, you're right next to all major shopping, tins of restaurants, Starbucks of course, and plenty of fast-food joints. The staff was extremely friendly and I would easily stay there again. The rooms are pleasant. I had a classic room, and it was a touch small, but it's fine fine for one or two people.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7351881">We stayed at the Mayflower Park hotel before departing on an Alaskan cruise and couldn't have been more pleased. We felt absolutely spoiled here--we had a lovely and spacious corner room with a view of the space needle (didn't even request it--lucky us!). This historic hotel's renovations were incredible. The bed linens were top quality, carpets were imaculate, wet bar area was a wonderful surprise and there must have been 4 sets of windows in the room at least. The marble bath was fantastic, as were the toiletries and the lighting. The staff was very helpful from the moment we stepped on the sidewalk until they loaded our bags in the cab the next day. Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. We discovered in our room directory, a welcome pass to Macys with a percent off coupon, for being visitors to Seattle. We arrived from a very long flight and were exhausted but with limited time in Seattle we forced ourselves to get out of our comfy room to see the sights of Seattle. We were maybe 4 blocks from Pike Place Market, just around the corner from a mall, several restaurants, across the street from Macy's and maybe 6-10 blocks from the Space Needle. There is only one or two small elevators, but in a historic hotel, I had no problem--we maybe waited 2-3 minutes for a ride. We must have passed 3 Starbucks just on the short walk to Gordon Biersch brew pub (wonderful views of Seattle, great food and muted lighting were perfect after a long day of travel). We slept like rocks on our comfier-than-home bed and awoke very early the next morning (still being on eastern time) and luckily that worked in our favor. We grabbed a cuppa joe at (of course) Starbucks and walked down to Pike Place and watched the flower markets and food markets open and get ready for the day. We walked behind the marketplace to see the sound in the morning and then tucked back in to Pike to one of the best diners, The Atheneum. We ate a hearty breakfast for about $6 each with coffee/juice. The inside felt like a classic seaside diner with a counter and several (full) booths. Great views of the sound from the windows and very friendly staff. Just let us take our time to relax and enjoy the view and food--no rushing. We walked through a few shops and headed back to the room a few hours later to check out. As we were checking out the doorman arranged a cab, and hauled our bags for us. Cannot say enough nice things about Seattle or this hotel. A great city, clean, friendly laid back people and great weather. One thing we didn't take advantage of was the hotel restaurant or room service. The food smelled fantastic though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7266245">Wanting to take our 2 teenage kids to see another city, Seattle was next on our list. I decided to book 2 deluxe rooms at the Mayflower Park hotel based on its location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. We prefer to stay at hotels that have a local feel, rather than a corporate hotel. This hotel fit that bill. Our rooms were nicely furnished. My husband and I had a corner room (I specifically requested because the deluxe ones are slightly larger). On the 10th floor we had a fun view of the Macy's marquee out one window and the Seattle Space Needle out the other. Our kids shared a double queen that had 2 seperate bathrooms! and an amazing picture view ot the Needle. Having 2 bathrooms for the kids was a very pleasant surprise, because the bathrooms are not large. One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again. The hoitel is located right next to the Monorail to visit EMP and the Space Needle. We all enjoyed EMP. Views from the top of the Needle were gorgeous and we were able to see all the way to Canada and all of the surrounding snow covered mountains. The Mayflower Park is very well located to ALL of the major shopping and just a few blocks from Pikes Place Market and lots of great places to have dinner. We really enjoyed Etta's Seafood. It had a great Seattle vibe, and something for everyone. Our best breakfast was sharing a bag of just fried dounut holes from a vendor at Pikes Place Market and coffee. As I said before, I had few complaints. I do see room for improvement in two areas: better beds (they move ALOT when ever your partner moves) and larger bath towels would be nice. My husband and I had cocktails down at Oliver's in the lobby. Nice bar. We did have a forgettable breakfast at the hotel and did not return to eat any other meals there. Having access to free wireless in our room was nice, too. All considered it is a good, centrally located historic hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6844376">We spent four nights at the Mayflower in February 2007. We understand that the hotel was close to being torn down when it was rescued and completely renovated by a local group. It is now an independently-owned hotel in the style of upscale classic city hotels, entirely non-smoking and in the heart of downtown Seattle within several blocks of Pikeâ€™s Market. For those who shop, it is convenient to major chain stores (Macyâ€™s, Nordstrom etc), and opens directly from the lobby into Westlake Center (an indoor multi-story shopping mall). Room costs vary and one can find bargain rates via the internet as we did. Our room had two queen beds, a large desk with drawers for clothing, an armoire with TV above and more drawers below, a coffee maker (with regular and decaf coffee and tea provided). There was no mini-fridge â€“ though we did not ask to see if one might be provided on request. The bathroom had a tub/shower and single sink, with 3 sets of thick towels (for two people). The dÃ©cor was tasteful and attractive â€“ dark wood Chippendale-style furniture in excellent condition, tasteful carpeting and drapes. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I communicated with one concierge by email and phone and she responded quickly and fully to my questions about transportation from the airport. The concierge on duty during our stay responded to our queries with enthusiasm â€“ calling a place we asked about visiting to make sure they would be open, making dinner reservations on our behalf, recommending another excellent restaurant and suggesting a theatre performance that we thoroughly enjoyed. Transportation from the airport is available by taxi, shuttle, and Grayline hotel bus. The latter is by far the least expensive for one person traveling alone (less than half of the shuttle cost, and about a third of the taxi fare) but stops at the Westin Hotel which is a short 1.5 blocks from the Mayflower Park. The short walk is slightly uphill and is very easy with a small roll-on suitcase. The hotel has its own parking garage on site. The hotel has an attractive bar and a restaurant, but no souvenir or other shop. For toiletries and the like, there is a drugstore a half block away from the Mayflower Park. For other items, there is the small but well-stocked gourmet Ralphâ€™s Grocery &amp; Deli about two blocks away from the hotel on 4th Avenue. Ralphâ€™s has a good selection of local Washington state and other wines, cold beer, and makes sandwiches to order as well as selling other grocery items. The owner (Joe Cohen) is very knowledgeable and most helpful with choices of Washington state wine and port as well as other products in his store.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6751811">This hotel is like being in Mecca if you're idea of Nirvana is shopping. It is very easy to locate in Seattle. The car valets were helpful and courteous. The front desk staff were prompt. And the concierge, well, he was the absolute best we have ever had. He had suggestions for shows, attractions, timelines, and restaurants. He even made suggestions for what to order off the menus! The room we had was a standard with a small queen. It was a corner room with 2 windows that opened to let in fresh air (yes, you need fresh air even in frigid February). It was a little stuffy without the windows being left open. I would say spend a little extra money and get a deluxe room with a king. The bathroom was also very small and not big enough for 2 people sharing! Definitely need either 2 bathrooms (as some of the more deluxe rooms have), or ask for one with a larger bathroom. However, we didn't spend hardly any time in the hotel as we were out and about so much. The location was ideal. One block from either direction of both Macy's and Nordstrom's (and about 6 Starbuck's coffee bars in a 4 block radius). Plus, just 5 minute walks from other name-brand chains. And close to Pike Place market and great venues like the Triple Door, and fantastic restaurants. Too many restaurants to choose from. All that means is that we will need to go back and try them all out. And we will definitely be staying at the Mayflower Park Hotel; plan to make it 'our hotel' whenever we go to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6650733">It was my first trip to Seattle, a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. He booked our reservations at the Mayflower Park because of its amazing location (it was within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see during our trip). We also both enjoyed the fact that it was an historic hotel. While the bathroom was small and the showerhead was so low on the wall that showering was an adventure, that is to be expected of an older hotel and it was neither inconvenient nor overly unpleasant. The customer service was fantastic. Our flight was incredibly late, and they accomodated our 2 am check-in. The valet service was also very nice. The bed, pillows, and sheets were very comfortable. I'm a light sleeper and I slept wonderfully, even with a room directly next to the elevators. The best part, however, was the amazing view of downtown Seattle. We even saw a Martin Luther King Jr. parade pass right under our window the morning we left! My only complaint was the expense of the parking ($28/day), something of which we were not made aware until we checked out. Next time we won't bring a rental car, or we will park it somewhere else ourselves. Other than that, the experience was incredible.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6439875">I have been reading all the reviews of the hotels that have been ranked above the Mayflower, and I find it very interesting. I live within 10 miles of the Mayflower, but every year our dinner club books a night here during the Christmas holidays so that we can eat downtown, experience the city, and not have to drive after we have had many cocktails. This year was no exception. The hotels that were mentioned with a higher rating than the Mayflower are great hotels. However, the Mayflower is far and above the others. This hotel has a much better central location, the rooms are large and very well appointed, the staff is great and courteous AND for the location and room - the price can't be beat. The hotels in the University District and on Lake Union are great - BUT they are a cab ride away from downtown Seattle. The Mayflower is right in the middle of Seattle - within walking distance of the waterfront, Pike Place Market, Nordstrom, Macy's - all the best restaurants. Plus, it is so reasonable. If this is where the locals choose to stay - we can't be that wrong. We love this hotel. The staff is wonderful and the Anduluca Restaurant is superb. Oliver's Martini Bar gets crowded - so arrive early! You will truly experience what Seattle is at this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6014705">I planned and coordinated a formal event at the Mayflower Park, and stayed there that night. Their restaurant and kitchen are exceptional. The evening of the event, the catering and staff impressed everyone. The following morning, eggs benedict with smoked salmon lifted any fatigue. The rooms were beautiful, relatively spacious, and well appointed - for a very reasonable (by Seattle standards) rate. I came in from out of town, and they were more than happy to accomodate my luggage until I could check in. Concierge was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to volunteer information before I needed to ask. I think an important note is that they helped us keep the event contained, so that no other guests were disturbed by the reception going on in the upper lobby. If I had been a guest at this time, this would have been even more appreciated. Certainly a quality hotel, with above average service and staff. I would definitely stay there again, given the opportunity.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5929942">If you want a hotel with a big Lobby packed with guests lounging around waiting for their Convention buddies so they can go to a noisy hotel bar, then the Mayflower is not the place you will want to stay. The Mayflower is one of those small historic hotels that if you were in London you would be writing home about. Cozy, charming and right downtown near all the stores including Nordstroms across the street. Yes, the bathrooms are on the small side but done in a very nice black &amp; white tile. Oliver's is the bar in the hotel and they are know for their martinis and the hotel breakfast at Andaluca is very good. If you are bringing your car, let me suggest you valet park it and then walk around downtown or take a cab, as it less expensive to do that than pay $12 for a 2-hour parking lot near Pike Place Market or a similar amount down near the waterfront. By the way, you won't be fighting a tour bus when you arrive, as it is a hotel made for people not conventioneers running up and down the hallway at 2am. Not cheap...but I have found not much is among the better hotels in Seattle these days.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5526432">My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Mayflower Park in July 2006. I chose it for the very central location -- walking distance to the Pikes Market, Space Needle, ferry terminal, monorail, etc.; the price-point -- about $215/night plus tax; and the good reviews here and elsewhere. The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice. If you're like me, and favor modern accommodations, no opulent frllls, consistent quality, and a feeling you are a valued customer. . . you may end up deciding the Mayflower Park is a bit underwhelming.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5513540">Mayflower Park Hotel Review â€“ 6/30/06 â€“ 7/2/06 and 7/9/06 My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time earlier this month, in conjunction with a cruise to Alaska. We always try to stay at historic hotels if possible, instead of the cookie cutter big box hotels where you would be hard-pressed to know what city or state you were in. We read the reviews of the Mayflower Park Hotel on Trip Advisor, then found their website on the Internet. I was hesitant about staying here at first, after reading Trip Advisor reviews about the small rooms and bathrooms. When I called to get more information, I was told by reservations that the deluxe rooms were about 100 square feet larger then the classic rooms. I knew through my research that all hotel rooms in downtown were very expensive, and I was pleasantly surprised to be told that with an AAA or AARP discount of 30%, the rate for the deluxe room would be $179 instead of $255. I reserved a deluxe room with a queen bed for 2 nights prior to the cruise, and for 1 night after we returned. I then received an immediate confirmation by e-mail. The Mayflower Park was the best of all the places we have stayed in the Historic Hotels of America group. The restoration/renovation of the hotel is beautiful and everything about our stay was fabulous! We arrived from the airport shortly after noon, and were surprised to find our room ready for an early check-in. Check-in was a breeze and our luggage was quickly brought up to our room. Our room was beautiful and very large! Room 815, which was on the northwest corner, faces Macys to the west and had a view of the Space Needle to the north, although the flagpole atop of the flatiron building next door competed somewhat with the Space Needle view. We also had a small glimpse of the snow covered Cascades between the cityâ€™s high-rises. This corner room was bright with 3 sets of windows, very spacious and beautifully decorated. Queen bed, 2 bedside tables, armoire with television, 2 upholstered chairs with a table in-between, and a desk with chair in an extended area that also had a wet bar with granite countertop, a small under counter refrigerator and a coffee maker. The coffee packs that were furnished were without a doubt the best hotel room coffee I have ever had! Bathrobes, hair dryer, ironing board and iron were in the closet (small) and the bathroom was also somewhat small, but beautiful with a new pedestal sink, large tub and a great showerhead. The only drawback here was the close placement of the toilet between the tub and the door. Not much wiggle room there! The toiletries that were furnished were top of the line. When the bellman brought our luggage, he told us that the rooms that ended in the number 15 (815, 915, 1015, etc.) were all the same large corner rooms. The front desk called a couple of minutes later to ask if we needed anything, and the only thing I requested was to have the same room for the following Sunday night, after we returned from our cruise. We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go in the downtown area. Pike Place Market was just 3 blocks away. Seeâ€™s Candies was 1 block. We also walked to Pioneer Square, the Smith building, the new library and the ferry terminal to Bainbridge. We took a city bus up to the Seattle Center, and then walked up to Lake Union for the Wooden Boat show. Weather was gorgeous! Would I stay at the Mayflower Park again? You bet! Would I recommend it to others? Yes, most highly and without a doubt! Service (front desk, concierge, bellmen and housekeeping) was excellent. Location was great. Room 815 was wonderful. I canâ€™t wait until our next visit to Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5469274">This is a lovely hotel, within walking distance to the shops (a chemist/convenience store is located about 2 minutes walk), Pike Place market, Space Needle etc. We were upgraded to a twin Queen suite which was really nice though the bathroom was a little small considering the room was so big. We were on the 6th floor on the corner of 4th &amp; Olive and had no problem with the noise from the roads. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. A lovely place to stay and would recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5441268">Seattle is a friendly city anyway but the Mayflower Park made it even more so. The staff were always ready with a friendly word, even if they didn't have to bother - and it really made our trip. We had a superb room, quite high up with a view (of the Space Needle) as requested. The room was beautifully clean and very well maintained, comfortable and relaxing. Situated Downtown, the hotel is in an excellent position for all the main attractions and an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of shopping and business. Expensive yes, but a great start to our two weeks holiday. A very classy and stylish hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4474756">My husband and I just got back from spending one evening at the Mayflower. It is a very beautifully decorated hotel. We arrived early and they held our bags for us and called us when our room was ready. When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running. Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room. The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size. So if you want to stay specifically in downtown Seattle then I agree the Mayflower is definitely a good location, but if you don't mind staying out a bit, try the Holiday Inn Downtown Everett!! Well worth it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4310240">I treated my wife to a night at the Mayflower Park for her birthday. They offer a great theater package that includes two tickets to the Fifth Avenue Theater (about three blocks away), valet parking and a room for the night. They also offer shopper and romance packages. First, you can't beat the Mayflower Park's location: it's in the center of downtown Seattle, adjacent to Westlake Mall shopping center and all of major department stores. The Mayflower Park is a great, 1927 vintage hotel that has been renovated without losing its deco character. The staff are attentive and friendly. We received a call within 5 minutes of going to our room to see if everything was okay. Our room was tiny by modern standards, but it was decorated so well that you almost didn't notice. Since the room was small, so was the bed. But it was comfortable. We also had a great view of the city and the holiday lights. The bathroom retains much of the original tile and has been renovated with high quality fixtures. All rooms include robes, irons, and coffee makers. The rooms seem well insulated as we didn't hear any noise from the hall or the street. The hotel has a great martini bar Olivers, and an upscale restaurant, Andaluca. We had a wonderful, romantic dinner before going to the theater. The food was top notch as was the service and ambiance. The only downside to the Mayflower Park was the lack of on site workout facilities and the elevators. There are only two elevators and they are small and extremely slow. But other than that, I highly recommend the Mayflower Park for a weekend getaway or a base camp for exploring Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4078488">We stayed at the Mayflower park for 2 nights in October 2005 as return visitors. As others have said, the staff is really the best! Derek the Concierge is extremely helpful. He made arrangements for a shuttle service to pick us up and take us to QWest Field (only $5.00 per person round trip) for the football game which was the main purpose for our visit to Seattle this time and gave us the names of plenty of restaurants from which to choose. Robert at the front desk couldn't have been nicer. We had some noise issues due to the location of our room (the headboards of our beds shared a common wall with the housekeeping supply room) so there was no sleeping past 8:00am, the time housekeeping starts working. When we spoke to Robert about this and a couple other small problems (the spigot of the bathtub fell out of the wall on my husband's foot and the air conditioning wasn't working too well), he immediately offered to refund half of the cost of our first night's stay. Not what we were looking for but very, very much appreciated! Also as others have said, the bathroom in our room was extremely small but they do the best with the space they have. The location of the hotel is very convenient to many of the great sights, shopping and restaurants of downtown Seattle. We'll be back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3987423">My hubby and I visited the Mayflower Park Hotel for 2 nights towards the end of September to celebrate our anniversary. One of the best things about this hotel is the staff. They are super friendly and helpful. On the night of our arrival they left us a box of chocolate truffles with an anniversary card signed by each staff member (which we thought was very sweet). The location is perfect. Everything is within walking distance. You can walk underground to the mall and Nordstrom &amp; Macy's is right next door. Be sure to get the 11% off Macy's coupon for 5 days from the front desk...we found it very helpful. Besides all the touristy stuff, be sure to take the tram along the waterfront to Pioneer Square. It's a bit like a clean version of NYC and has so much character. Overall we had a great trip and our stay at the hotel was very enjoyable (loved the Aveda products supplied too). The only negative thing I would say is that the bathrooms are a bit on the small &amp; old side. They should probably be upgraded...but then again, it goes with the rest of the hotel. Very charming with a great atmosphere!<topic>none</topic>

We requested a room upgrade, but the hotel was full. However, the front desk clerk gave us coupons for free drinks and appetizers in the lounge. The lounge was great and so were the free drinks and appetizers. The room was really small and the bathroom was tiny, but this is an older hotel. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but it looked really good for this range hotel - lots of newer equipment, tvs and magazines to make it less tedious, and the air conditioning worked. We'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3836989">We enjoyed a two night stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel in August, 2005. While it was a busy time in Seattle (The Ring Cycle was at the opera that week) we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. We had a wet bar with coffeemaker, mini-refigerator and sink, large living area with desk (free wireless internet access too, very nice), sofa and comfy chairs, king bed, large closet/dressing room, and nice bathroom though small, but with historic fittings. The Hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and the lobby is small but evokes a historic feeling. Another nice bonus was the invitation to the Wednesday early evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres in the restaurant, Andalucia. Very pleasant experience. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but the hotel's location right in the center of town provided us lots of exercise walking up and down Seattle's hills. We walked to REI, the Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and even the Victory Brewery from the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were particularly helpful, and the host at the wine tasting was very pleasant. We would certainly recommend the Mayflower Park Hotel and will definitely stay there again-there was so much to see and do in Seattle, we barely scratched the surface!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3810497">What a great hotel! Stayed here for 3 days before boarding a cruise to Alaska. The location is fantastic. We saw all of Seattle's best sites and never needed a car. The monorail station is in the adjoining mall. Could walk to Pike Place, flagship Nordstrom (yay), even to Safeco Field to see the Mariners. The staff was gracious and helpful, always willing to offer directions, suggestions or to secure a cab when needed. The rooms weren't huge, but more than adequate - light and very clean. Would definitly come back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3691903">Great location, historic hotel with very good staff. Unfortunately the air conditioning was broken the evening I stayed at the hotel. I was immediately given a fan which worked very well and I was very comfortable. I was very satisfied with my stay and loved the location in the middle of shopping. Would definately stay at the Mayflower again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3685877">We stayed at the Mayflower Park for two nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The room (deluxe) was large and beautiful with a couch and two upholstered chairs, desk and nice furnishings. The bathroom was small but not too small. Nice linens and towels. We didn't have a car and thought the location was ideal for shopping, Pike's market, Seattle Center and even walked all the way back from the baseball game through Pioneer Square, etc (about 30 minutes). The staff were all very friendly and helpful and Andaluca's, the restaurant, was excellent (had breakfast and dinner). We would definitely stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3682194">We stayed two nights in a deluxe room (7th floor at the corner of Olive and 4th). The rate was competitive with other downtown hotels that were highly rated on this site, and I was unable to find a better rate on Hotwire for a hotel of the same class. The room was large with an excellent bed and a comfortable sitting area, adequate closet and drawer space, nicely decorated and appointed. The bathroom was small (no vanity) and I had some difficulty maintaining constant water temperature in the shower. There was some noise from the hallway but muffled, not loud enough to disturb the peace except doors slamming in the morning. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful (parking valets who offered to take care of luggage if we wanted, front desk staff, and especially concierge). The location is excellent, especially close to shopping, a few blocks walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, about a 15-20 minute walk to Pioneer Square. Were I to return to Seattle, I would return to the Mayflower Park unless an equivalent hotel offered a substantially better price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3506591">I have been living in this cute, little hotel once a month for about 3 years now (3-12 day stays over the last three years), so this might be somewhat biased. I reside here for business reasons, so the free WiFi is much appreciated. The rooms are small as American hotels go, so if you like larger rooms, go elsewhere. Even the suites (I've stayed in almost all the rooms at this point) are small. However, the warmth of the staff over the years (with little turn-over, actually) and the coziness of both the connected bar, Oliver's (one of the best Martini bars in Seattle- a MUST!!! even if you don't stay here) and Andaluca restaurant, which is pricey but tastey (free wine tastings on Wednesdays) are sometimes worth the small rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near several restaurants and many stores: Macy's (they give you discounts for this former Bon Marche at the hotel), Nordstroms, Abercrombie, Sophora, etc. The hotel is connected to Westlake Mall (another convenience), and the monorail is on the top floor that can take you to the Space Needle, park, and Experience Music. The Simpson's did a take-off on this one minute monorail, another part of Seattle life. Each room is carpeted with an armoir that contains a t.v. and drawers for whatever, no mini-bar. The beds are quite comfortable, and a.c. or heat are generally in good working order. If you're uncomfortable, go down to the desk and let them know- they will re-accomodate you. The restrooms are nice, but have limited space just above the sink on a glass railing to place personal items. Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion) are provided as complimentary items. Showers are somewhat narrow, so it help to put the rubber mat on the floor. All closets are a very nice size with thin, cloth robes provided. Of course, very Seattle-esque, there is a Tully's on one corner and Starbucks just behind the hotel. I have read many of the reviews thus far, and I agree with all of them; however, one must remember that Seattle is the Emerald City, and people operate on a completely different level than in other parts of the country; it's part of the charm (and sometimes healthy tension). Having lived in New York, L.A., Dallas, and Houston, it was culture shock at first, but then it became delightlful and the source of good laughter. I got a good laugh from the review before mine about the guy not knowing how to make coffee- that's so Seattle. Yes, phone servce in the hotel is not the best, but Seattle people like face to face, and the responsibilities of that SMALL front desk with that many rooms and people wearing two hats is difficult.... Just relax. The lobby is GORGEOUS! A huge chandelier hanging in the front with fresh slowers put in often. The 2nd lobby floor (that connects to Westlake) contains a player piano and great sitting area fo meetings. Meeting rooms are great at his hotel, which is often the host to social events, from weddings to other celebrations. My only complaint is about the elevators: they are certainly large enough, but since the wait staff, maids, etc. use them, they often take a LONG LONG time to get to the lobby. Just go the bar, get a Martini, then catch it when you can. Make sure to visit restaurants along the Sound. The concierge (Derrick these days) is excellent, and they can get you deals that sometimes you can't- every conciege at this hotel has been both brilliant and enthusiastically helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3432715">Stayed at the Mayflower Park in Feb 2005 for a few days and had a wonderful experience. We were able to obtain the Entertainment rate which was 50% off the rack rate. Room was very large and we had a view of the Space Needle. Front desk staff was very helpful with last minute dinner recommendations. Did not eat at the hotel because it was on the expensive side and there were so many places to eat within walking distance. Monorail entrance is located next to the hotel and the underground bus stop is down the block. Definitely would stay at this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126166853">I chose the Moore Hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and was very pleased with my choice. I wanted a hotel that I could get to easily by rail from the airport, and the Moore fit the bill. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a bit of a view of Pikes Market and the waterfront. The front desk is extremely helpful, Robert and Tracy were awesome! They helped with bus schedules, restaurant recommendations, and loads of general Seattle information. The room was a bit chilly, but the front desk was quick to offer extra blankets, so we were very comfortable. Even though the rooms do not have a small refrigerator, I bought some cheese at Pikes that the staff was kind enough to store for a couple of days in their refrigerator :-) We were not interested in a hotel with a fitness center or big restaurant, so the Moore was a great option for saving a bit on the room rate so we could enjoy more activities. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I will stay there again. Another tip - consider buying the Seattle City Pass!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR125720270">I read thNe reviews, saw the location and price and decided that booking a room here was a good idea. My advice:don't do it people, just don't. Go for a brand name hotel, and pay a little more. That way, if something goes horribly wrong, you may have a shot at getting some kind of resolution. This is a true story, swear to God: my husband went to wipe himself off with a towel-twice while taking a shower and both of the towels had fe..s on them. Yes, fe..s. He flipped out and took the towels to the front desk. The manager was not there, and upon checking out, I explained to the girl at the front desk that not only was this appalling, but dangerous. Particularly to my one month old baby. I also told her, that I did not feel like I should pay for our stay there. I did pay though (Dumb. In retrospect, I should not have), because I just thought I would settle this with the manager later. My thought was the manager would listen to what happened to us, and act appropriately. That didn't happen. I emailed "Mike", the manager, then followed up with a phone call. He basically called m a liar, said that "never in my career have I ever heard of something like this", to which I replied, "Well I haven't heard of anything like this either in all my years of traveling, but this really did happen." He then proceeded to give me the third degree about where the towels were located, when this happened blah blah, etc. It was very apparent that he felt that this was some creative attempt on my family's part to get a refund. God, what a jerk. I am POed all over again just writing this. I asked for a refund, he said no, then I told him that I would need to file a complaint with the BBB. He then said, "Go ahead! I don't care, you can threaten me all you want!" Uh, no Mike this isn't personal, just horrendous customer service. Like, on very level imaginable. Whatever. I told him, fine. If this is the way you choose to handle this. I filed a complaint w/the BBB. come to think of it, I think I'll contact The Health Department too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124832388">Stayed here for a concert next door. That is very convenient. The parking issue is a royal pain in the butt and I thought there must be internet or something in the lobby because it always seemed full in the morning (no internet elsewhere its just an old building) but discovered Sunday morning everyone was sitting around because the parking garage didn't open until 9am. Glad I didn't have to be anywhere! Booked months in advance and was in for a rude surprise then we checked out and they tried to charge significantly more than the agreed price. There is another place nearby with significantly more to offer for much less but I dig "historic". I don't dig surprises. Eventually the manager made good but it was after I got home. The restaurant next door turned the music up LOUD one night as if to tell my group GET OUT as soon as we sat down. That was fine, there's an Irish pub on the back side of the block (not the douchey one down by the market place) that had excellent food at excellent prices and the nicest staff we've ever encountered in downtown Seattle. If the other place hadn't chased us off we'd never have found the good place. The Moore doesn't even know what the word amenity means. What you get is a very clean room with a small TV and in our case a great view. There is nothing else, no fridge, coffee or microwave. The cleaning staff is terrific (cleaned our room twice one day which was funny and sweet). It was November so it was cold. There is no A/C and we don't think the heat ever came on in the 3 days we were there. Waking up at the crack of dawn and searching for breakfast was quite the adventure. The coffee shop next door (adjacent to the lobby) is terrific. The new owners are great. It kept the cloying damp at bay and prevented me from melting down when I discovered our car was being held hostage after we'd moved all our stuff downstairs and given up the room key. The theater next door is a great venue but the hotel was just ok.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124209876">I cant begin to do justice to our experience of staying here last month. Helpful, oddball staff left us wanting for nothing and tolerated our drunken late night ramblings like champs. We thank you, sincerely. The rooms were lovely, remodeled and finished with modern amenities that meshed well with the historic qualities of the hotel. Windows in the rooms actually open! We had a great view of the Puget Sound and Pike's Place was a just around the corner. Tons of Bars and Restaurants within a stones throw. Another thing we liked was that each floor had its own color scheme. One floor reminded us of a vampire brothel, if such a thing could exist. needless to say, we explored the entire Hotel, it was just that kind of place. We all agreed it felt haunted and the receptionist told us that many a creepy thing has gone down there over the years. Anyhow, beds were cozy, showers worked just fine. Room were clean. Ice machine worked as it should. I cant think of a single bad thing to say about our 2 night there. HIGHLY recommended.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123259753">The first experience of this place was great, it was the young guy on the front desk he was the most genuin nicest guy and just really wanted to help us, so we checked in we had a private room with own bathroom it was good size and clean and comfortable, the value is great for the price. It's only a couple of blocks away from main street of shop and wharf also a couple of block each way from the nicer restaurants. As I said earlier what really makes this place is the young guy on front desk he really made our stay we would ask him anything and he would be genuinly happy to answer and told us about some of the best restaurants I've ever been too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122495629">My husband and I have stayed here twice, one night each time - first to attend a music concert at Nordstrom's Benaroya Hall and second for a soccer game at (formerly QWEST Field but now called) CenturyLink Stadium. We knew that it was going to be extremely basic accommodation so we weren't disappointed. Being as central as it was it was a quick walk to the Public Market or to shops such as Macy's. The rooms are spotless and adequate for a no-frills stay. Given that all buses in the downtown core are FREE 24/7 there is the option of taking a bus to/from any downtown destination.Because the weather was so nice we walked to the soccer game and back. It is quite a distance so one would want comfortable walking shoes to do so. I was surprised to see how the area around the Public Market seemed to roll up the carpets by 9pm, hardly anything open to go for an after-game beverage/dessert.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122083848">This is a gem of a place. It's the one clean, upscale Hotel I could find in the heart of downtown Seattle that had double rooms for under $100 a night. The booking staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and made it easy for me to unexpectedly extend my stay. There is free access to a computer in the Hotel lobby - so if you don't have a Wi-Fi ready computer with you, you still have Internet access here. There is no breakfast served in the Hotel, but you are within walking distance of many coffee/bakery shops and of a 24-hour McDonald's. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I would definitely book into the Moore!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121366427">Located in downtown Seattle we were able to leave our car parked for most of our visit. We were within walking distance to Pike Place, great shopping and restaurants. Our room was not ready when we arrived so we went to eat and it still was not ready when we got back. I would advise letting the staff know if you will be arriving at check in time so your room will be ready. The room was clean, the staff friendly. Our only problem was no air conditioner, Seattle was having unusually warm weather and we had to attempt to sleep with the windows open. This was difficult because of the location, nightclubs, sirens and garbage pick up very early. I would recommend this hotel for anyone on a budget. It was very reasonably priced and has a lot of history. And check out the painting on the elevator.<topic>none</topic>

A few blocks from almost everything - including two of the best restaurants we visited (Serious Pie &amp; Dahlia Lounge), Pike Place Market, the monorail to the city centre and downtown. Some shouting and sirens at night on the weekend. ROOMS Super basic rooms take this hotel from great to average. The room itself is a good size with enough closet space and drawers. Linens were clean. There is no heater in the room - when we went it wasn't too cold though I'd imagine in the dead of winter this could be an issue. We only had one night stand which was kind of annoying. The bathroom is tiny - REALLY TINY. Impossible to take a shower - it's so narrow that when you turn the shower on, the water sprays clear past the curtain. STAFF Friendly and helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118947473">The hotel is newly renovated and our room was very clean and comfortable. There was a bit of noise from the concert going on in the theatre, but hardly noticeable on the fifth floor. You can hear it more in the bathroom but since I don't sleep in there it was of no concern. The room was very modern and we had a claw foot tub in our bathroom. The only downsides are that there was no mini fridge or microwave in the room and since the building is ols so is the plumbing. The water temp tended to fluctuate a bit during showers, but nothing uncomfortable. As far as the frige and the microwave go, we ate everything fresh from restaurants and the market. The fridge would have been nice to keep drinks in the room cold, but we just filled out ice bucket up and kept them cozy in it. Overall the hotel was much more than I hoped for. Very friendly staff are at the counter 24/7 and they can recommend some great local eateries. Now on the the location. It's 2 blocks from the market! Seeing as most everything we did was there it was super convenient. What was farther (Space Needle, EMP Museum) we took the monorail. It's in the Westlake Center (1-2 blocks away) and ends right beside the Space Needle. It's $2 one way and it takes 90 seconds. When you're running late for a tour because you've spent too much time lingering in the museum it's a very nice option. Totally worth the 2 bucks.<topic>none</topic>

It had a private bathroom with a non functional shower and no mirror and in the morning we woke to some insanely loud construction type activity in the alley. That said, I would definitely recommend the Moore... Everyone we interacted with was friendly, the maintenance guys even took my boyfriend and I down to check out the Olympic size swimming pool in the basement (it's empty)!

The upgrades they've made kept in with the time period of the motel and looked real nice. For the price of a downtown motel, we couldn't beat it.

Excellent, central location for a very reasonable price. The service at the front desk has always been courteous, helpful, and friendly. The rooms and the entire interior, though basic, are very charming and clean. There's a clawfoot tub in the room, but the plumbing is completely modern, and is as good or better as other upscale hotels I have reserved. I have to think hard to find something negative to say. The shower curtain in my room was a bit musty, but opening the window quickly and completely eradicated the scent. As many have said, there's no air conditioning, but I can only imagine this being an issue on maybe 5 nights a year, during an unusual heat wave. And the street noise (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) is audible. But unless you are really sensitive about any of those 3 things, I'd highly recommend The Moore...I think you will find it will actually be a fondly memorable aspect of a visit to Seattle, a city with many attractions and things to be fond of.<topic>none</topic>

This hotel is within walking distance to many attractions including the market, ferry to Bainbridge Island, art museums, shopping and countless restaurants (including the dahlia bakery--trust me, you need the triple coconut cream pie). Keep in mind that the Moore is an old building. The rooms are simple, neat, clean and have a bit of character (wood trim). The windows look out onto the street, but never was I disturbed by street traffic. The desk staff are incredibly helpful, have good recommendations and are willing to do a bit of searching to help you navigate the city. There is also an attached bar, the Nitelite.

<comment category="positive" id="UR117906564">We only stayed at the hotel for one night. I enjoy older hotels with some history, and thought the Moore Hotel was beautiful! It was very reasonable, especially considering the location. There were 4 of us sharing a room. The rooms were clean, had a nice view, and there was enough room for all of us. We were on the 6th floor, and didn't have a problem with the noise. The windows opened, and there was a small fan, which was fine for us, but if it was hot, the room would have been hot. Fortunately Seattle doesn't get that hot! The service was great...and we asked them quite a few questions about the area! They did everything that they could to answer our many questions!!! I was surprised by the complaints about the service, however, I believe that the way you treat people...comes back to you. There were so many options for eating within walking distance. I loved being so close to Pike Place Market!!! Had fun at the Nitelite bar next door too! It was a local bar feel, and he bartender was great! I would stay at the Moore Hotel again, if I get to visit this lovely city again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117849035">Have stayed here before. They charge 74 dollars vs over 150 at every other hotel downtown. Steps to Pike Place Market. Not far from transit options. Large ceilings and rooms that open. I had Room 700 facing Macys which was very quiet. Rooms clean as a whistle. Fans in room since A-C rarely needed in Seattle. Neighborhood sketch at night. Nearvy Cafe d'Arte has great coffee drinks. Walk down one block to First Avenue for a selection of great Belltown Restaurants. If you are a frugal traveller, you will like the Moore. Otherwise pay the 200+ plus per night and stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117837308">The location is very good, so close to Pike Place Market. However, it was loud if you stay in a room facing the street. We were on 7th floor and still could hear loud noises from the street throughout the night. Not only that, you can hear your neighbor's TV so the wall must be really thin. The room was okay, quite roomy and clean.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117723389">The Moore is definitely a good value. For a queen room with its own bathroom, the price was under $100 per night. Some of the rooms have shared bathrooms and these are even cheaper. The room was spacious and clean. There was not a lot of street noise but I could definitely hear doors slamming in the hallway (walls are pretty thin). I could easily walk to all of the major sites from the hotel: pike place market, seattle center, downtown shopping, and the ferry terminals. Late at night the area did feel a bit sketchy. It's not full service, so I had to go downstairs and get my own extra blanket. There was no climate control (air conditioning or heating) in my room so I had to open and close windows to be more comfortable. There is no coffee or tea in room, however the hotel just opened a coffee shop next door. I tried the espresso and it was really good! Also the shop has baked goods and muffins for breakfast. I would stay here again... but if you're fussy about certain things then this is not the hotel for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117500588">I always find it a bit tough reviewing hotels of this class...no matter how good a 'deal' it is I can't give it better than an average rating since esthetically they are obviously challenged. So...IF you want a deal in one of the best locations in Seattle and don't care about esthetics (or air conditioning) then I'd highly recommend this place. I was there on one of the hottest weekends of the summer so the rooms was quite hot and stuffy without a/c but I know that's a non-issue for 80% of the rest of the year. I stayed in #210 which is right above the Dive Bar...not recommended. It was a massive room though and thank God we had our own bathroom! And they also kindly gave me a deal because of it's location - very nice of them. I hadn't realized when I booked that some rooms don't have their own bathrooms...you have to use the ones in the hallway. Again, personal preference I guess but that's a deal breaker for me. The room was clean, and that's the most important thing to me. But it's also very old and dated and we had a huge crack in the bathroom wall where part of the wall was literally peeling off. The lobby is very nice and also the only updated portion of the hotel and the front desk staff are some of the friendliest/most helpful I've met anywhere. Also, booking the reservation over the phone was a pleasure. The parking is a steal at $12/day a block away. Amazing location one block away from the market and 3 blocks from main shopping area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117322972">This is the sort of place I almost don't want to tell the rest of the world about. Very affordable and just the basics that you need for a mid-scale urban pedestrian martini-fuelled safari!. The Moore is basically a 100 year old hotel that has been maintained nicely, but not redecorated to keep up with the fashions....it's all nice and clean - no fancy amenities, no bar fridges, no pool or hot-tubs, etc. Our plan was to park the car ( this part is a little tricky) walk to Pike's Place Market, have a great seafood meal (Cutter's - great but not cheap) hit the local pubs - a little jazz or blues....it all worked out perfecto! What we saved on the hotel paid for half the meal...the room had a great view (8th floor facing the ocean) no balcony but huge windows (that open - so careful with kids!!) So close to so many great sites....downtown Seattle is the best walking place!! And the room was quiet.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117241305">I would definitely recommend the Moore. It is the best deal for downtown Seattle hotels, including the parking voucher which allows you to park in a garage a block away for $12 a day. The hotel doesn't have a lot in terms of "extras" like fitness rooms or breakfast, but it more than makes up for that in cost, location and friendly staff. We stayed in mid-August and never felt too hot in our room and we slept VERY comfortably. The Moore is just a quick walk to the Market, bus lines and other downtown attractions, and it has a lovely/super affordable Vietnamese restaurant (Long) right across the street if you find yourself hungry upon check-in!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117109410">I enjoyed my stay at the Moore Hotel. It is a very reasonably priced hotel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean, the individuals at the hotel lobby desk were friendly and helpful, and there was a computer available in the lobby to check e-mail and view the Internet. I was able to walk or take the numerous public transit options to view many of the attractions of interest to me in Seattle. Also, the hotel is only a 3-minute walk to the Central Link light rail, which for $2.75 can take you to the SeaTac airport. The negatives are that there is no breakfast, no fitness center, no writing desk in the room (so I ate my snacks/meals by the nightstand), and no air conditioning. The air conditioning was not an issue for me even for the week I stayed in August, as the Seattle weather was pleasant and cool and there was no need for air conditioning. It would have been helpful if the window had a screen as I minimized opening it due to my concerns that bugs would fly inside. I highly recommend the hotel and would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117012672">Two blocks from Pike Place Market, you'll find this little gem. And for $100/night (for a Thursday) in this area of Seattle, you'll have a hard time beating the price. This is a renovated original building, complete with real keys (versus the plastic variety). I felt like I was in an old movie when I walked off the closet sized elevator, down the hallway. It's not one of those all frills included hotels, but you will get clean linens, and basic toiletries, and excellent guest service. The bathrooms have claw foot tubs, and although the shower head was a little low for my height, the charm of the room itself made up for it. I rated the sleep quality as average related to the box spring mattress, but the room itself (on the 7th floor) was quiet. The location and the charm are two of the best features of the Moore Hotel. As long as their prices and service continue, I would pick this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116968984">We stayed at the Moore Hotel for 2 nights this month. We stayed in one of the queen bed rooms on one of the upper stories with a private bathroom. We were extremely impressed with the quality of our room, the price of the room, and the attention to detail in the decor. The hotel maid staff is clearly a cut above the rest: when we arrived they had folded all of our towels into the shape of different animals. They even creased the paper in the toilet paper rolls. The room was very clean and tidy. The view from our window was also excellent. We had a great view of the Puget sound and other historic downtown Seattle buildings. The bed was comfortable and we slept great. A couple other things: 1) There are men and women's restrooms on the first floor which is very convenient if you need to use the restroom while checking in or after checking out 2) They have a luggage closet where you can store your stuff if you want to continue roaming the city after you have checked out. 3) The furniture in the lounge are is very comfortable But, the absolute best thing about this hotel is..... The Location!! We were enthralled to find out that almost all of the restaurants we wanted to eat at and a lot of the things we wanted to see and do in Seattle were within a few blocks of the hotel! Perfect location for anyone visiting the city. We were very happy with this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

This worked just fine--people routinely leave their doors open and it's a friendly environment. The front desk staff were helpful and accommodating. The rooms were clean as was the entire place. There is no air conditioning but there are fans in each room and the windows open. Located within walking distance of the Pike Street Market and lots of other places.

But where can you stay in downtown Seattle for under $100? Not many places. Fabulous location. Easy walking to shopping and Pike Place and we also walk to and from the Mariners games from here.

<comment category="positive" id="UR116723897">My husband and I, reeling from the $500 cost of a two-night stay in a popular chain hotel in Portland, made it a point to search for a less expensive option in Seattle. We're both glad we did. The Moore Hotel was comfortable, quiet, and clean. We even had views of the Seattle Harbor from our seventh-floor room! And it cost us only $100 a night, including tax!! It was a fabulous deal. (The only drawback that we saw is that the room wasn't air-conditioned. But we were comfortable and cool regardless.)<topic>none</topic>

The Moore Hotel in downtown Seattle is a GREAT DEAL! It is a few blocks from the Pike Place market, all the hip clubs and restaurants in Belltown, and also within walking distance of the Seattle Art Museum, Symphony Hall, etc. Granted, the place isn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. The bed was comfortable, the room was good sized, and our room was quiet and clean. What more do you need?

<comment category="positive" id="UR116571580">The Moore Hotel is an old funky hotel that was clean and comfortable. We had 2 queen beds (3 of us stayed there), and our room was quite large. The bathroom was a decent size with a shower. Some rooms share baths, but our on the 5th floor did not. We opened onto the street but were not disturbed by noise. The people who ran the desk - particularly Robert, Liz and Emily - were amazingly friendly and helpful. Robert gave us restaurant tips and seemed to make his choices after he talked with us a bit and could tell what we might be interested in. The service from all 3 was warm and friendly. We felt right at home. The location (on the edge of Belltown) was great for dinner at night and the Market and sightseeing during the day. We will definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116327551">The location is great, 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. It's an older hotel and is not fancy, but you can get 2 rooms that share a bathroom for the price of a single room anywhere else. One of the rooms had its own sink, and there was a sink, toilet and shower in the shared bathroom. The shower was pretty small, and missing a soap dish, but the water was hot and the water pressure was good. The bed was very comfortable, although the pillows were a little firmer than I like. There is a theater next door, so if a performance is going on, I'm not sure how noisy it would be; there were no shows during our stay. There was a band playing across the street one evening, fortunately they didn't go on too late, because even with the window closed it was pretty loud. The hotel has a deal with the nearby Macy's garage, you can park for $12 a day. I'm not sure if they have air conditioning, I suspect they don't, although it wasn't an issue when we were there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116310627">Older hotel in a questionable neighborhood, but it is located in a very good spot. Only 2 blocks away from Pike's Market, a few blocks from Westlake Center/Downtown area, and couple blocks from the Sound Transit Link Station and free 99 bus line (for going to Pier 66 cruise terminal). You know you're in a vintage lodging when they still give out actual metal room keys instead of a key card. There was noise from the street people out on the sidewalk, but at least it stopped by midnight or so. Tiniest, slowest elevator ever seen, get used to only using the stairs. Got the queen suite (family didn't want the smaller rooms w/ shared bath) which was surprisingly spacious with a kitchenette which included a microwave and small fridge.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116189285">I checked in to a $120 suite and at first glance it looked fine, apart from the view of the rooftop ducts and carpark. The fridge was the first issue. The ice box was broken and turned the entire fridge into a freezer. Everything I had bought from the local grocery store, after a long-haul flight from London, was frozen solid when I got up the next day. The fridge was replaced, but no apology made for the wasted food. The second issue was the WiFi. Nobody could access it. It requires a username and password. The ones supplied by the front desk were rejected. The manager came round and said the router was broken. After he appeared to have fixed it and left, the problem persisted. The third and most important issue was the desk clerk. His name is Robert and he quickly grows impatient when you report problems, blaming it on "the guest's equipment". I said that without WiFi I would need to check out, since I am on a business trip and need to access emails. His reply was "Awesome" and "Have a nice evening". After a long flight and business to conduct this is the last thing you need. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are looking for a hostel. The prices are modest, but the staff do not like dealing with problems with the room. I got the impression it is family run, with the desk staff being relatives who do not need to worry about complaints from guests.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116111505">We stayed at the Moore Hotel for one night at the end of July 2011. The hotel is ideally located just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market right in the center of downtown. The staff is very friendly and helpful so you tend to overlook some of the other shortcomings. The hotel is old, the elevator is old, the rooms are very basic with no coffee maker, no alarm clock, small older TV. There is quite some noise from the street if you open your windows. The bathroom is old with no vanity. Having said all of that, the rooms are very clean and they are non-smoking. The rates at this hotel are great and it is still a good value for the budget traveler.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115984903">I hated staying in this hotel. First of all, there's a very strange building next door which I think either houses the homeless or the crazy's. There was one lady at the front desk who was nice. Otherwise the guys behind the desk are rude, punk college kids. I had several run ins with their attitudes. Also on one particular day they were cleaning the windows; the guy propped up his squeegee which ended up falling over and hitting me.The walls are really thin and I had a room by the elevator so every time someone came on and off the floor I heard it. I would never stay here again, I chose to stay in this location because it was the only affordable thing around the convention center. However on the price vs. quality comparison, it was still a rip off.<topic>none</topic>

We flew into Sea-Tac and took the Link Light Rail to Westlake Station, If I had any complaints at all it would be that there are no coffee makers in the rooms and there is no coffee in the lobby (but we got great coffee, hot tea, and crumpets at the Crumpet Shop in Pike Place Market every morning). Just a note: our room had a clawfoot tub shower, which might be difficult for some people to get in and out of.

<comment category="negative" id="UR115739875">This hotel's location was fantastic. Central in terms of downtown Seattle, and two blocks from Pike Place, which is a good starting place for anybody coming to Seattle. The room itself reflects the price you pay--not fantastic, but relatively clean and comfortable. The major problems I had were that the water temperature wasn't regulated at all--I was scalded and frozen within seconds of stepping in the shower. It was also a very small shower, which was manageable, but tough to shave in. The people at the front desk are mostly fun, but the wireless is awful everywhere except the lobby. All in all, unless the you have a ton of money to spend in Seattle, the Moore is a good value, especially as you will spend very little time in the hotel anyway, Seattle is FANTASTIC!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115362432">The Moore Hotel is cozy, clean, comfy beds, charming, has very reasonable rates, has a great location (two blocks from Pike Place) and appealing staff. It is a historic hotel but it is well-maintained with nice furniture, good carpets and freshly painted rooms. If you're looking for a luxury hotel this isn't it, however. There's no pool, only one small mirror in the bathroom, you have to park in a parkade across the street, there's no kleenex, hair dryers (maybe if you ask at the desk), wifi in the rooms or alarm clocks. Also, the homeless shelter is on the same block. It's a busy area however, so I never felt unsafe walking around with my two kids. If you value cozy charm, value, and location over luxury, make sure you stay at the Moore!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115249114">I was able to book a last minute stay here over 4th of July weekend. The first thing I noticed about the place was how nicely decorated and clean the hallways were. The room I stayed in, on the other hand, was a lot plainer--though clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful, friendly, and accommodating. You have free internet and wifi use in the lobby, too. CONS: 1) Having to wait to use the shower. You pay a low price for the hotel because bathrooms are not en suite. I think one morning, I waited about 2 hours to be able to shower, even walking downstairs to check other floors. The bathrooms could have been a tiny bit cleaner, too, but it wasn't bad considering how many people use them. 2) No free parking. You get a discount, though, in a lot near them. It can add up, at $12 a day. Or, you can park at the meters after 6 for free ($4/2 hours before 6pm) and move the car at 8 am. Overall a really nice hotel in a great location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115122774">We stayed in one of the suites of The Moore hotel during last June, and I must say it's the best I've ever experienced in Seattle. The room was spacious, and so was the bathroom, there was also a living area that could have been more comfortable, but was good enough for us, with a kitchenette and a dining table. The decoration was simple, modern and very nice, combined with some old features, such as the radiators. And it's true that they fold the towels in animal shapes. We had a dog (although my husband believes it was a rabbit... whatever... it was puppy, believe me :P). The location is perfect to go out at night, to go shopping during the day, and itÂ´s only a couple of blocks away from the seafront and the market, and a short walk to the EMP, International fountain, Space needle, etc. The parking is a block away, and it's 12$/night. You can request a card in the hotel to request in/out privileges. BUT! it closes at midnight and opens again at 7, so if you're going to be late at night, you better take a cab to avoid having to park on the street. Back to the hotel, the staff was very helpful and friendly at all times. The only rude person we met was the bartender of the bar next to the hotel, but we're unsure whether it belongs to The Moore or not.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114930861">The Moore Hotelâ€™s location, ambiance, and value for the price simply canâ€™t be beat. My husband and I loved its easy access from the airport via the light rail, and were equally delighted by the short walking distance from the hotel to the original Starbucks CafÃ©, Pike Place Market, Westlake Center and the monorail to the Space Needle, and other major shopping and tourist attractions. The hotel has been recently renovated but retains its wonderful Beaux Arts character. We particularly loved the buildingâ€™s tilework, wooden doors and balustrades, decorative artwork in its interior hallways, and tasteful elegance of its guestrooms. The lobby offers free wi-fi connection, and is a charming and comfortable space to work or socialize. Our sixth floor room was spacious, spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable, and had been tastefully updated without losing its vintage character and upscale European feel. The paneled oak door, which opened with a real key, led into a generously sized sitting and dining area with a small kitchenette, with the bedroom and bathroom just beyond. The room appeared to have been freshly painted and furnished, and was beautifully appointed with all the typical amenities (coffee maker, hairdryer, etc.). Although not air-conditioned, opening and closing the two large windows provided satisfactory â€œclimate control.â€� The historic Moore Theater (next door) featured a performance by Steve Earle the night we were there, but we noticed no noise even with the windows open and slept very well. We enthusiastically and unreservedly recommend this boutique hotel as the ideal place to stay in downtown Seattle. The staff members were friendly, helpful, and provided an extraordinary level of customer service. For example, we were boarding the cruise ship when I suddenly realized I had left my parka in the hotel lobby when we checked out. I telephoned the hotel in a panic, and a staff member jumped in his car and tracked me down at the pier, jogged up to me with a cheerful smile and my parka in hand, and tried to refuse the money I offered him in compensation for his time, trouble, and expense. Four days later as I stood on the deck of the cruise ship in the rain on our approach to Sawyer Glacier, comfortably wrapped in my lined parka, I was extremely grateful that we had chosen to stay at the Moore and for the hotel staffâ€™s exceptional commitment to excellence in service. We will definitely be back!<topic>none</topic>

The beds were very comfortable, the room spacious, and there was a good view. The only con.s for me were that 1. there's only one key per room (actual key, not key card) so we had to switch off who was responsible for that, which was tricky at times - although we could leave the key with the front desk as needed, and 2. the wireless internet was unavailable in my room - it was one of those things that maybe if your computer was positioned just right in just the right corner of the hallway or something you could get it, but mostly no. I was able to connect just fine for free in the lobby (which was comfortable and well decorated). A minor concern in addition was that my reservation didn't appear when I checked in - they were having some sort of computer problem that day. It was resolved quickly and the staff were really friendly through the process. Again, the location is wonderful - a quick walk to tons of restaurants, bars, shopping, etc., you're right over Pike Place, etc. I would definitely stay here again, especially considering the great price! PS: There were no shows going on during my stay so I can't speak to the noise from the music venue. Our room was nice and quiet.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR110115033">Stayed 2 nights - our first trip to Seattle in 10 years. Was super impressed with the Moore - leopard skin carpets, high ceilings, double room was larger than my previous house. The location is as good as it gets, 2 minutes from Pikes Market, heaps of eating options close by and felt like the heart of the city. Service was fine, although we rarely used them, room was spotless and for my two boys (4 and 5 yrs), it was honestly the highlight of our holiday to the NW. Highly recommended.<topic>none</topic>

The objective was to have dinner and breakfast in the room with young children. No door between the 2 bedrooms. Very good beds. A good choice for the price and the location in downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR104414861">My husband and I like to find interesting, historic inns whenever we travel and this hotel fit the bill pretty well. We rented one of the suites, Room 701, which appears to have been combined from 2 standard rooms into one suite during a recent renovation. I do have to say that I'm pleased we booked a suite vs. standard room as those appear to have been left out of the renovation process and are, well, exactly half the size. While we enjoyed our stay here, it is probably important to note that older travelers that are less flexible with certain conveniences may opt out of this trendy, historic hotel that is next to a concert venue. PROS: -Location. This hotel is right up the hill from Pike Market and walking distance to much of what the downtown has to offer. We walked the whole time to restaurants, bras, the Argosy boat tours, monorail stop, and to light rail to/from the airport. -Great service, friendly staff. Great knowledge of the tourism opportunities in the area. Let us use their printer for boarding passes for free. -There was a fully stocked dining room and kitchen, complete with dishes, utensils, wine glasses, pots/pans, wine openers, etc. -Very nice decor, modern decorations and great attention to detail. -The claw foot tub and spacious bathroom. -Lots of windows -Compared to area hotels, you get a lot for your money here. -There were no shows at the Moore Theater during our stay, so there was no issue with excessive noise besides general city street noise. -Very nice lobby/sitting area. CONS: -The comforter was a little "plasticy" and there no duvet for it, just 2 sheets folded around it. This quickly came undone and I was a little skeeved by the lack of skin-to-blanket barrier. -The water temperature would on occasion go from the set temperature to screaming hot, and back. The staff acknowledged this problem stating that the hotel was very old and it sometimes helped to have the water run for 5-10 minutes prior to getting in. This didn't work so well for us. My advice is to aim the water lower so you can escape quickly to the end of the tub. Overall I'd recommend this hotel. It's not going to be your Westin/Hilton experience, but with a few inconveniences this turned out to serve us quite well on our vacation and didn't break the bank.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98668377">Hahaha. So I booked a room with two double beds for me and 3 of my friends online. And when we got there we didn't have a bathroom in our room, it was down the hall. And there wasn't an option for a bathroom online that I remember. And the room we got was tiny! So we asked the front desk and they were happy to accommodate us for only ten dollars more we got our bathroom, and a MUCH bigger room. But aside from that. Everything you need is right by the hotel! Parking was cheap, After the hotel discount. And the hotel was beautiful. The bathroom and the first room were a minor setback.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR95601691">The Moore Hotel is close to everything that is nice in Seattle, I admit, but forget about sleeping if you stay there... The hotel was built around the Moore Theatre and every second day a rock band is playing there.. it is really noisy as the walls are paper-thin.. The rooms are small and cold, but the staff can give you a heater if you ask for it, so that's okay. Overall: stay there, if you don't want to pay a lot and if you care about the location only. If you have greater expectations, forget it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR93628807">I recently stayed at this hotel and thought it was exceptional considering the location and the price I paid. I could see the Pike's Market sign from my window. It was walking distance to the waterfront, stores, and seattle center. The bed was super comfy and I never had a problem sleeping. Everything was clean. The room was a little plain, but it had everything I needed. The staff was very helpful to me. They do not have free parking, however, if you do have a car, they offer discounted parking at a secure location one block down the street. Considering the outrageous parking prices in Seattle, the discounted rate was very reasonable, My floor was really quiet, eerily so sometimes. But I really liked it and would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR87826146">This place is the worst hotel I ever stayed in. My wife and I got into town to catch a show in town we had tickets for. When we first arrived at the hotel and got into our room I sensed that this place was trouble but since it seemed quiet - 6pm at the time - and we drove all day to get to Seattle; we decided to try it out and get some rest. We went to bed at about 9pm because we were exhausted but did not get much sleep because we were awaken by the neighbor's blasting there music and drinking and yelling at about 9:30pm. The walls are paper thin so you can hear every word the people in the next room were saying - or should I say yelling. It sounded like there was 20 people in the room all talking at the same time and drunk and loud. The real insanity started at about 1am when a couple of men started arguing loudly and began threatening each other. They then began to fight in an obvious physical brawl that carried out into the hall, complete with screaming girlfriends and death threats the sounds of a bottles breaking in the room while the brawl continued out in the hall. The fight eventually de-escalated but now the drunks decided to 'talk about it' out in the hall in front of our door. The people who were still in the room decided to put on gangster rap music full blast until approx. 6 am before it stopped. My wife and I did not sleep a wink the whole night and the next morning when we approached the girl behind the desk and explain to her why we not be returning the next night - or ever for that matter - she said she is used to dealing with drunks in the halls and really enjoys yelling at them when that sort of thing happens there. The insinuation was obvious - this type of activity is not uncommon at this hotel. THIS PLACE IS A DUMP AND A DRUNKEN FLOPHOUSE!! Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks and go to a real hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR86437012">This hotel was a convenient, low-cost old hotel. The place is a bit the worse for wear but clean and quiet. The staff seemed a bit confused however, gave me the wrong room key then argued with me for several minutes before providing the correct key. The rooms were relatively spacious considering the age of the place and cost per night. Plenty of clean towels were provided and the water-pressure and water-heat were impressive. I had a nice stay and enjoyed this very walkable area of the city. There was no cell phone coverage or internet in the room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83656760">I found this hotel on TripAdvisor and glad we stayed. I love the Pike Place Market and you can't get any closer for under $100 a night. And they validate parking so it was only $12 for almost 24 hours. The hotel is of course OLD but we like the way it has been renovated and the features such as windows that open. It was great to be so close to the market. We had a great dinner at the Virginia Inn, breakfast at Baaco's, and lunch at Lowell's in the Market. We noticed lots of young people and Europeans and other foreigners at the Moore. It definitely is not typical but so worth the price for the location. We would stay there again. There is a wonderful small Catholic church next door also. A really interesting neighborhood.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83640442">Best hotel location in Seattle! If you're looking for a place just to sleep that's close proximity and has all amenities in the neighborhood, stay here. It's definitely close to Pike Place Market (5min walk), close to all bus stations, nearby bars and most importantly good eats. We basically walked everywhere we needed to go and took the bus if we were too tired. Their bus system is real easy to use. I'm an instant fan and have been raving about this place since.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83518523">We love to visit Seattle and love the Moore Hotel. It's just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and only a few more blocks from the Piers. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. The hotel is older, but is packed with some great artistic decor. The bar downstairs is a dive, but worth checking out just for the people watching opportunity alone. Beds are cozy, bathrooms are clean. Prices are much better than nearby chains. Plan to visit nearby Ohana Restaraunt (excellent!!) and our new favorite bar, Bathtub Gin. We've even stayed here for a few Seahawks games. You can catch the bus nearby, or walk the mile to the stadium.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR82881825">I chose to stay at the Moore Hotel with my friend as it was in a great location and very reasonable in price. It's so close to Pike Place Market, the shops in downtown Seattle, and the exit to the Light Rail. If you arrive late in Seattle and need a place to eat, the guy at the front desk said the only place open is "Night Kitchen" and it was a nice place to eat. The only real downside of this hotel is that it's sooooo quiet. Some people like quiet rooms, but I found it very hard to sleep at night because I could hear my every movement. My friend and I would see many people in the lobby each day and at night, it was dead silent. I think part of this has something to do with the fact that they do not have an air conditioning system, which we didn't really need, but I think the white noise from the AC would have allowed me to sleep better. The beds were pretty comfortable. Also, there was no hair dryer.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR81764226">Arrived at our reserved hotel, The Moore, on our first night in Seattle. Right off, we had a car, so parking might have been an issue, but we always parked after 9 at night and were gone before 8 am, so on street parking was free. Otherwise there was a $12 all day parking lot very close by. We were traveling with my sister and her daughter. They were staying at the plush Sheraton for a conference. Since we were not going to be in the room alot, we didn't want to pay the $360 per night that the Sheraton was asking. Hence, we booked a room at The Moore. After dropping off my sister and her daughter at the Sheraton and seeing their plush room, coming to the Moore was shocking. It is an older type hotel - like something you'd find in an older section of Europe. when we checked in at 10:30 p.m., the lobby was dimly lit, but I did notice beautiful furniture and artwork. Also, there was a disco next door of some sort with loud music. I was just beside myself. Then we took the elevator up to the top floor for our room - again, when I switched on the lite I was grimacing. It was your very basic room. I quickly realized that it was "dim" because they were using CFL lightbulbs (good for them!), so it quickly got much brighter. The first night I didn't know what to expect, but we were there for four nights so I was going to make the best of it. It quickly grew on us and by the end of our stay, I downright liked it. The walls were tastefully painted, it was clean, although old. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. It had a great view out the window. It was not hot or stuffy. The exterior hallways had nice artwork and were clean. And every night when we came back to our room, we couldn't wait to see what new animal shape the maid had created out of our towels and left them artfully on our very comfy bed. Yes, maid service! My sister didn't even get that at the Sheraton!. So, even though a bit shocking start, we really liked this hotel, the location was fabulous (although it is in a so-so neighborhood, so caution is in order), parking was easy and everything turned out fine. Can't beath the price in downtown Seattle and I'm sure we could have done a lot worse. Oh, and the free internet terminal in the lobby was INVALUABLE!<topic>none</topic>

You can't beat the location and value for money - close to Pike Place Market and the shopping district. You can walk most places and close to monorail for Space Needle and buses in centre are free if you need one. Okay so its very dated and the paint is peeling on the walls but the room was a good size and had a nice bathroom. Only a fan but with the weather in Seattle that's not a major issue.

<comment category="positive" id="UR79590205">Our family usually stays at one of the bigger hotel chains downtown in Seattle and we walk ourselves to exhaustion, but this trip we decided to try an older and closer hotel to the Market and boardwalk areas. When we arrived we were checked in right away and Bob our Concierge was really super friendly and an all around cool guy! Our room was much bigger than some of the older hotels we've stayed at in Vancouver, so we were happy with the size right away and the bathroom was pretty large as well. I enjoyed walking the halls and looking at old photos and each floor is decorated uniquely. My only two complaints are the hot water nearly scalding me to death in the shower with no warning, and no little coffee pot in the room, but hey its Seattle there are coffee places at every corner. All in all we enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Thanks for having a little fan in the room as well!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR78966225">This was one of the cheapest hotel that we found in downtown Seattle, and we were not disappointed at all. We didn't have any problems with our reservation and people at the front desk were friendly and helpful. We had a room with a shared bathroom (which is what we asked for; these are their lowest priced rooms). The room had older furniture but was clean, and the shared bathroom was perfectly fine. It's very well located too, as you're a few minutes walk away from the downtown transit tunnel (w/ light rail directly to/from Seatac airport), Greyhound bus station, and of course the Pike Place market. If you're looking to save on lodging costs in Seattle and you don't mind not having brand new furniture in your room, don't look any further, this hotel offers incredibly good value.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR78410303">I stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend. We are travelling the USA, and admittedly have been staying in cheap hotels and hostels. While our expectations are pretty low when it comes to accomodation, this hotel really disappointed us. When we arrived, the man who checked us in was extremely rude. Didn't even say hello, and when we questioned why he was printing a receipt from the credit card machine with our credit card details when we weren't paying for our room until check out, he got extremely defensive and uppity. Later on, we spoke to another, younger guy at reception, who was also incredibly rude and was saying very explicit swear words, even to older guests. This was so unprofessional to us. Our room was basic, the bed wasn't particularly comfortable but everything was generally clean. After we checked in at reception, we went upstairs to our room and, after trying to enter, we discovered a man was in our room watching TV. what the hell? was our reaction. I think he worked at the hotel, but again, unprofessional. The next day, a guy at reception gave us the wrong directions to the airport...good job we checked it with somebody else or we would have missed our flight. The shared bathroom was dirty and the toilet was blocked for a period of about 8 hours (it was blocked in the morning when my boyfriend had a shower, and was still blocked by the evening when i showered). Luckily we had a toilet and sink in our room. The only good point about this hotel was the free to use computer in the lobby with fast internet. Then again, that is expected these days with hotels. The location was okay, but it didn't feel particularly safe despite being in the centre of the city. Overall, we did not enjoy our time here. If you are looking for cheap accomodation in Seattle, go with HI hostels instead.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR78179865">I stayed at the Moore for one night (a Sunday). My room was on the fifth floor and all night long I heard trucks and buses thundering by. It was so loud, I didn't get any sleep. I even had earplugs, but the noise was so loud it couldn't be blocked out. I would not stay here again because it was so aggravating. Now, if you are a deep sleeper, you will be ok! Also, be aware that the hotel has no airconditioning. This wasn't a problem the night I was there, but during warm periods, it would be awful. A positive aspect is that it is very close to Pike Place market.<topic>none</topic>

The Moore is located an easy 2 block walk from the train which runs from the airport. A mere $2.75 per person gets you there! Each room was decorated differently - we had a walk in shower &amp; my daughter's room had a clawfoot tub. They have really kept the "feel" of the hotel as it was nearly 100 years ago but recently updated. The room rates were very reasonable. It's located 2 blocks from Pike Place Market &amp; very close to several restaurants. You won't find a better value for your $$.

Pay the extra for a suite (it's still super cheap); it's huge with a kitchenette, high top table, large bedroom, a very comfy bed, and an antique clawfoot tub. Our room was super clean and quiet which we really appreciated. This hotel is well situated with easy access to all public transit and just a few blocks up from Pike Place Market. There are a few cons. Beware of the water temperature going from warm to literally scalding without notice. The staff seemed mostly apathetic but for one very friendly and helpful young man at the front, so don't expect a lot of assistance. One gal literally told me she had no idea what to recommend to do because "there isn't a lot to do in Seattle." There is a homeless shelter two doors down, so especially after dark there are some character hanging around on the sidewalk. They didn't approach us, so no harm there. All that said, I HIGHLY recommend this spot (at least the suites). It is the best value in downtown.<topic>none</topic>

We liked the fresh air from four opening windows and minimal noise from the street (on 7th floor). Internet worked most of the time. Parking, only half a block away, is $12 - a bargain!

The lady behind the counter told us we couldn't because the rooms weren't clean and they hadn't had check out yet...really?!? You don't have ONE clean room that we can have?! My bf was practially getting sick in the lobby and they showed no compassion. And to make it worse, they gave a woman with a baby a room right away, and they did the same to another family. But when we went up and asked a different person we got a room right away. Obvioisly that lady was on a power trip! That lady needs to work on her tact!

Talk to anyone behind the counter and you get an amazing story, inside local info and more than one good story to tell your friends. I would be amiss if I did not give Wyoming (aka Bob) five stars!

<comment category="positive" id="UR69344713">All in all, a fantastic stay in Seattle, minutes from both the touristy markets, and in the other direction, where the locals hang. My husband and I had never been to Seattle and after reading reviews on TripAdvisor, we settled on the Moore Hotel, and we are so very glad we did. We arrived at 10 am, well before check-in, but the front desk was able to hold our luggage in a secure, locked room, until our room was ready. Our hotel room was great, room 731. We had what the front desk described as a "Malkovich door", from "Being John Malkovich", a small-ish 3/4-sized regular door. The room was immaculate and had a decent view, but the floor to almost ceiling windows were fantastic. The location was great, right next to the Moore Theater, where Aziz Ansari was performing that night (we had already seen him perform in Minneapolis), and only blocks away from the Pike Place Markets. The front desk staff was very friendly and gave some good recommendations for lunch, and was very courteous. The hotel was connected to the Starlite Lounge, a very cool rat-pack era low-key dive bar that had really cheap strong drinks! We also happened to see Aziz Ansari after he was done performing at the bar, which did add to the whole experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68474013">Thank you, Moore Hotel people. Thank you for the location. Thank you for the quiet, clean, and large room. Thank you for the funky and tasteful decor. Thank you for the handsome but basic old-style bathroom. Thank you for all the coffee I could drink, because I'm a coffee lover. Thank you for not giving me silly frills that I didn't need and didn't want to pay for. Thank you for the computer in the lobby, and the comfortable lobby itself. Thank you for the extra blankets. Thank you for the lovely kitchen table setting, which was classy but not pretentious. Thank you for not charging an arm and a leg. Regarding location, It's not just close to the market, it's close to everything. It's convenient if you like to take public transportation, like we did. Moore Hotel has personality, it has soul, and if I ever need a hotel again in Seattle, it'll be the Moore. My only complaint, and it's minor, is that the kitchen burners didn't reach a high temperature, making it not-so-convenient for cooking and boiling water.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR62185505">A beautiful hotel in the center of the action in Seattle. A great deal but not a cookie cutter Ramada Inn or Sharaton. An artsy experience that's isn't prefabricated. One night while staying there, Corinne Bailey Rae performed at the adjoining Moore Theater and Clint Eastwood's wife was staying at the Moore. Walking distance to parks, harbor, shopping, etc. Go to Cafe d"Art on the corner where the drip coffee and lattes are like butter!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR49053687">I would not recommend this hotel for someone looking for a 4 star hotel and over the top amenities. You are not going to get that at The Moore, but what you are going to get is a great location at an amazing price. I've read some of the reviews and yes, the hotel does have an older look to it, but I wouldn't hold it against this historic hotel. They offered a wonderful collection of shampoos and soaps and the cleaning staff did a tremendous job. You can see where some of the floors are getting updated and some that haven't been touched yet. We had one of the cold rooms with an attached bathroom, while a friend had one of the hot rooms. Luckily Seattle favored us with warm, sunny days during our trip. I have no complaints against traffic noise (we were on the 7th floor).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR48244444">We spent three nights at the Moore Hotel and for the money it was excellent. The room had a cracking view of the Port and even though it was at the front of the hotel, it wasn't noisy in the slightest. The room itself was big and airey with a large-ish en-suite. Everything was very clean and the bed comfortable. This hotel isn't smart or fancy and there was a small patch of peeling paint on the ceiling in our bedroom but if you're on a budget and looking for somewhere in central Seattle, you could do a lot worse than staying there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR47672804">The Moore is a few blocks from Pike's Market. Public transportation is nearby. We ditched our rental car and used buses and cabs or we walked everywhere. The neighborhood has its share of urban ills, but so does every other big city and we were never scared. If you want to stay in downtown Seattle for a reasonable price, this is the place. The rooms are being remodeled so while plain, they are getting updated one by one. Some of the staff were amazing, and some quite indifferent. It can be noisy, so definitely bring earplugs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46271579">I needed to stay in Seattle for as little money as possible. I planned on a hostel, but they were full so they referred me to Moore Hotel. I paid around $60 a night, which is about half of what you would pay for any other hotel downtown. Although the building is old, it was clean and very safe. The desk is attended 24 hours a day, and the doorway between the lobby and the stairs/hallway is locked at night. The room, though Spartan, was comfortable. I appreciated the small touches, such as the towels folded into animals. I chose a European Style room, which means there is a sink in the room but the toilet and shower are down the hall. The hall bathrooms were kept very clean. I never had to wait to use them, so the arrangement wasn't as inconvenient as I thought it would be. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about restaurants, shopping, and must-see attractions in Seattle. Location was ideal. Everything I wanted to see was in walking distance. For example, it is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. However, down the block from the hotel was a drug rehab-salvation-army-type shelter place, where support groups met. So, if you are intimidated by people that do not look wealthy or middle class, may sometimes be dirty or wear odd clothing, walking past this place may be a bit intimidating for you. I was a little intimidated (I'm from a rich suburb), but I never felt as if I was in danger. This is important, as I am a woman who was traveling alone. Overall, I had a great experience at Moore Hotel. The next time I go to Seattle, I will book a room there without hesitation.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR46127407">I liked the Moore. They were doing some renovations and all the halls were decorated differently. Not a "cookie cutter" hotel like most chains. Interesting... I stayed in a 2 Queen bed room for 2 nights and it was fine but when my friend left, I decided to splurge and get a suite (for only $125!) for the next two nights. It had a sofa and love seat with a coffee table and an entertainment center with a flat screen TV. There was a glass dining table all set for 4 but you coudl fit 6 people around it. The bed was a king and very comfortable. There was a full kitchen and nice bathroom with vintage tiles. I was very impressed, expecially at that price. There were large windows in the living room and you could peek between the buildings and see the cruise ships. Pikes Market is a couple blocks away and you can get amazing pastries and coffee as well as flowers for your room and they open early. People at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. I noticed some people thought it was noisey because of the theatre. I didn't notice that but I may have been toward the opposite end of the hotel. There is a bar and a women's shelter and some other building for homeless on the same block but we had no problem with anyone on the streets. The area around Pike's Market is nice, shopping, eateries, really cute.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR45548174">The room was small and dark and hot, the beds uncomfortable, and there was loud street noise, including drag racing, all night long. The heat could not be adjusted (the people at the front desk were no help at all with this), so we had to have the windows open; therefore, due to the heat and the noise in the street we got no sleep at all. The most unbelievable part of it all was actual drag racing in the street below our window in the middle of the night. I've never seen anything like it. Would definitely not stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

But turn right out of hotel to experience Belltown shops, cafes and bars. But bring your own shampoos - not supplied in room. Its an upgrade from the hostel down the street and now if you are like me and plan to be out on the town and dont need to spend a lot of time in the room, you will be fine here. My room with a view I could see the space needle. somewhat noisey at night if your window faces the alley with trash trucks and the City is repaving the street in front so that could also be the source of city noise. good value, and well, "moore" than I expected.<topic>none</topic>

Do not ask the front desk anythingâ€¦ because they do not know anything. I was surprised about there ignorance. I used the wifi in the lobby, so I caught some conversations with people with question or remarks, and sometimes they were just rude to people.

<comment category="positive" id="UR34499492">The Moore Hotel isn't for everybody- if you want anything fancy, stay somewhere else, but if you want a unique, historic hotel, it's great. I've stayed here on several different occasions, and have been pleased. Don't be put off by the sometimes cluttered lobby. The rooms are all different (and in varying stages of remodeling), but all are clean and spacious. The price is right. Request a room with a view of the bay. On the downside, the walls are thin and there is no air conditioning, but even on a hot day, the rooms cool off by evening with the windows open.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33203702">We took a room at the Moore when it seemed that all rooms in Seattle were taken. It has both good and bad features. The accommodations are Spartan but clean and spacious. The location is great except for the drug and alcohol recovery center next door, which results in individuals of questionable character loitering on the street day and night. (These folks can be avoided by walking on 3rd St. or on the west side of 2nd St.) We appreciated the kitchenette, but had to request a microwave, which was provided. There were very few cooking utensils, but nice tableware. There were no knobs on the cooktop, and none could be found by the staff. Electrical wiring was stapled to the walls, and there was no clock or clock radio. We were on the street side, 2nd floor, and there was considerable street noise (much of it from the rehab folks next door.) Free wi-fi worked well. Would we stay here again? Probably. If you limit your expectations, the Moore provides acceptable, spacious, but spartan accommodations.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR32324385">I was spending a few days sightseeing in Seattle prior to travelling up to Vancouver for an Alaska cruise. I chose this hotel based on location and price. I will admit to being a little nervous as we pulled up in front of the hotel - it's definitely nothing to look at - but the lobby had an old-time charm to it, and the staff were warm, friendly, and helpful. I was given a verbal description of three available rooms and allowed to choose: one with a clawfoot bathtub, one on a newly remodeled floor, and one with a view of the water. I chose the waterview, which was on the seventh floor facing Second Ave. And received, to my great surprise, an actual KEY - not the key card you get at all the chain hotels. You can see the water over the tops of the other buildings. The room was quite large, with a very high ceiling and two big windows that you can open - which is a good thing, because there is no air conditioning, and the weather during my stay was sunny and warm. There was a small tabletop fan, which was a huge help both in cooling down the room and in providing white noise to counter the traffic in the street below. Very plain decor, institutional-looking bedspread and drapes. Nice little table near the windows, but the chairs seemed low when using them with the table. The bathroom was small, and it puzzled me. In the space where a bathtub would normally be, there was a shower stall. There were walls on both sides of it, which made the space next to the toilet uncomfortably small. And that shower was extremely temperamental temperature-wise - it would not maintain a constant temperature. All that being said, however, the hotel was clean and just a short walk from Pike Place Market and Westlake Center (and the monorail). When you input the address shown here on TripAdvisor, it doesn't line up with what I found in reality; it's on Second Ave between Virginia and Stewart, right next door to the Moore Theatre, which did not have any events during my stay. This puts it on the same block, practically next door to some kind of housing called the Josephinium, a "Recovery Cafe" and what appears to be a group of social service agencies. So there were some interesting characters hanging out in front of those buildings - but they were not of the type who accosted passersby. The public transportation buses are free within a downtown zone which includes the Moore Hotel. A cab down to the Amtrak station cost, as I recall, about $12. This was nothing fancy, but all I needed was a place to sleep when I wasn't rambling around, so it suited me just fine.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR30482472">Stayed with my husband and two teenage daughters in March. We did face the bay and I was happy that we could open the windows. Downside very loud on the weekends with ppl coming out of the clubs with drunken yelling. I'm sure earplugs would work, but didn't notice any noise from other guests. I liked our rooms with their high ceilings. we had two rooms that were adjoined by a bathroom. Each room had its own closet and TV. The kids room had 2 twin beds and an extra sink and mirror. All this for about 130.00 per night. We also had a microwave and frig. Very clean room, heat with radiator. Desk staff was adequate, not overly nice but not rude either. We had fun here, a little dicey neighborhood at night but I walked along and felt safe, but I live in a big city so I'm used to panhandlers and street ppl, but if your from a small town or the country this might not be the place for you. Only bad thing I could see was there was no A/C so a hot night/day in the summer might be very uncomfortable but perfect fall through spring. Walked everyday to Pikes place also walked to space needle just a mile or so, very close to lots of shopping and restaurants.<topic>none</topic>

Not sure what else people are expecting - a trouser press? Staff at reception were really friendly (with the possible exception of the older chap - the manager?!).

<comment category="negative" id="UR27586997">I joined TA recently so my stay at The Moore is not that recent but I'm so surprised by all of the positive reviews that I felt like I should detail our experience just for an alternate viewpoint. We had so many issues during our stay it's hard to know where to start. We spent 2 nights in October of 2007 and it was quite chilly but there was no heat in our room. The front desk person told us that it came on automatically at a certain time but it never came on at all for us. The sheets were thin and barely large enough for the bed so they slid off the corners all night. There was a closet but not one hanger to be found. The elevator was so small that if you had luggage you had to wait until there was no one else using it in order to have enough room to bring up your things. But the absolute worst part for us was that there were concerts going on next door both nights and the noise level was so intense that it literally rattled our walls until well after 11pm each night. I will agree that it was a great rate for the location but in future I would definitely pay more for a more comfortable room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26657207">This was my first time going to Seattle and I didn't really know how things were situated downtown. However, after going there and staying in two different hotels just a few blocks from each other, I can say that the Moore is the best deal. It's literally 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. The rooms are bare and old, yes, but very clean. The cleaning staff even makes towel animals like they do on cruise ships - a small but thoughtful gesture for a minimally staffed hotel. My only "complaint" is that the bathroom is VERY small, which wasn't a problem for me but if you're claustrophobic I would not stay here. Things I didn't know before staying there: the hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby though it's not advertised so you should ask the receptionist. In addition, it is a historic hotel and is next to The Moore Theater. Both of which were featured in a little walking food tour we did, so be sure to check out the theater, I hear it's beautiful on the inside! Bottom line: If you don't care too much about hotel amenities and are just traveling to explore the city, then the Moore provides a perfect place to sleep and have easy access to downtown Seattle. Parking is definitely an issue though, so if you are traveling with a car I'd look into another hotel that offers parking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR25674255">The Moore is an old hotel with a good city location, for a budget price. We stayed a couple nights over the summer and found it to be okay, if not great. Our room seemed reasonably clean, but the furnishings and facilties are clearly old. By old, I don't mean 1980's old - the hotel was built in 1907. That said, we had reasonable expecations and we were comfortable enough. The view of the Space Needle from the fire escape was also pretty amazing. Whether you enjoy the Moore or not depends mostly on you. If you're used to cheap places with a backpacker / hostel feel, you'll fit right in at the Moore. If you generally choose the Hyatt, you should probably avoid it. I would also avoid the Moore if I were extremely safety-conscious. This is not the building I would want to be sleeping in during an earthquake or a fire. Our biggest inconvenience was parking. We were in town for a couple weeks and had a car and a lot of stuff. We ended up paying a fairly hefty rate to stay at a skeevy parking garage down the street. By the time we wrestled the luggage up and down a (very dodgy) parking garage stairwell a few times, I started to suspect we might have been better off staying somewhere else. Bottom line, if you're travelling light and cheap and want a good downtown location, the Moore is probably a good choice. If you have a car to park, or a lot of luggage, or you tend to like newer places, get on Priceline or Hotwire and check out their deals on chain hotels. You can probably stay at a Hilton or Marriot property for about the same money as the Moore using this technique.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23364434">This was my 2nd stay at the Moore. Be sure to ask for a room on the water side on one of the upper floors, this was the advice I found on tripadvisor.com last year, and the advice I followed. Great view and could just see part of the Public Market neon sign. Everything downtown in easy walking distance, or the free bus zone. The nicest desk clerks who speak well of management and are more than willing to pass on their considerable knowledge about taxis, restaurants, shopping. I was even offered an umbrella for predicted rain. Sizable room and closet, hot water, quiet, clean. This year's surprise, the hand towel/washcloth folded swan has been joined by a bathmat/washcloth elephant. This could be an old European hotel. I couldn't be more pleased with the value for the price, the location, and the personable staff.

<comment category="positive" id="UR23170578">Our stay at the Moore hotel was very enjoyable. We were visiting Seattle on a busy weekend, so rooms were a little hard to find. We took a chance on the Moore after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were glad we did. The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of downtown attractions, especially Pike's Place Market. In fact, if you stay at the Moore, don't even think about renting a car. Parking is too much of a hassle to worry about, and walking is just too easy. There are a couple of things that were not great about the hotel: The immediate surroundings are more sketchy than some of the more touristy areas. Also, the rooms are not air conditioned- which is only a problem because this part of downtown has plenty of bars that can be loud with an open window. Overall, the Moore was great, and the staff is very helpful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23055663">The Moore's location is ideal: easy walking distance to Pike Public Market, restaurants, and Westlake Center. The rooms have no frills, but are clean, comfortable, high-ceilinged and have refrigerators. Those used to staying in modern hotels like Hyatts, Holiday Inns, Sleep Inns and the like may be disappointed in the furnishings, but this is a turn-of-the-century building with that type of charm. It even has keys for the doors -- not key cards. Staff is friendly, internet in the lobby is free, and some floors have wireless capability (you have to ask for one. The only down side is that it doesn't have parking, requiring some hunting for lots that match your schedule. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. For $100 a night in downtown Seattle, it's a real bargain.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR21259667">You really have to hunt to find a buget-priced place in Seattle. This place was mentioned in my Lonely Planet guide, and got good reviews on here, so my friend and I stayed there 2 seperate nights in September. For about $110 US a night, this place was an excellent choice. The staff were laid-back but pleasant and helpful. The neighbourhood wasn't too rough, and it's very handy to all the major attractions of Seattle, especially Pike Place markets. The room was simple yet excellent. We had two double beds and a private bathroom (you can go without a bathroom in your room, and use a shared bathroom for less $) The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the beds comfortable and immaculate. The room was also spacious and you could open the windows a little to let in fresh air. One of the most lovely things about the hotel was the presentation of the bathrooms. The towels were plentiful and were folded into fan shapes- a really nice touch! Only one drawback- it's a older building, so there was no air conditioning in the room (though a powerful desk fan was provided.) If you're one to suffer the heat, be advised, it could get quite stuffy in summer. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you're on a bit of a budget.<topic>none</topic>

The bathroom is very old ( i would say 60 years)...but the shower fixture is new...unfortunately made a very large crack in the tiles and left 2 cemented holes where the taps were. But the location..awesome..I could see the water from my room and it was an easy walk to pike market and to macy's to get the free buses around downtown...and to the airport (not free).

<comment category="positive" id="UR20144257">We stayed at the Moore Hotel while spending 3 days in Seattle waiting to board our ship for a cruise to Alaska. We thought the hotel was a pretty good deal. It's easy to get to from SEA-TAC airport. Just take bus 194 and walk the 2 blocks to the hotel. Could not be easier or cheaper at $1.50 one way. The location is great. You are close to Pikes Public Market and downtown Seattle is well within walking distance. However, its location is also the only disadvantage we noted. 2nd Avenue is a pretty busy one way street leading into the downtown area. With the windows open at night, the police car sirens were pretty noticeable as well as pretty frequent. But that is a small price to pay for staying at the Moore. The hotel itself shows character. It is clean and housekeeping was great. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom we had was private and had recently been remodeled. No complaints at all. The desk crew was very friendly and helpful. There is a room where you can securely leave your luggage on your last day after checkout for that one last jaunt to the market. All in all we would stay at the Moore again. It's price, location and traditional character make for a pleasant stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19830765">The hotel is in a great location only two blocks from the farmers market. Lots of buses run nearbuy aswell so its easy to get around. The hotel itself is a little dated in its decor. We had a european style room which meant the bathroom was shared however there is only one bathroom and toilet for the whole floor (im unsure how many rooms are european style). It would have been nice to be given a bath robe for going to and from the bathroom and any other hotels we stayed in provided these. Overall though it was a nice hotel in a good location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19589419">Perfect for a night before and a night after our cruise. Family of four, with two teenaged children. We had a suite both times, two rooms with a bathroom in the middle for $121. Can't beat it. We were on the 3rd floor the first time, 6th floor the second time. Both floors were updated. It is an older building, but there was fresh paint, it was clean and we even a a towel elephant in the bathroom! TV and fridge in the room, internet in the lobby. Two blocks from the fish market, about 1/2 mile from Whole Foods. The desk clerks were great, helpful and stored our luggage after we checked out. Buses are free, so we were able to get around easily. Seattle has some interesting characters, I don't think they are limited to the Moore hotel area. There seemed to be a lot of tattoed, body pierced folks and homeless people. We are from the Philadelphia area, so this was not so unusual for us, but I can see how some people might be afraid. We had to go to the drugstore in the evening, and we felt safe. One regret is that we did not have a room away from the street. Apparently, the suites all face the street. I did hear the street noise at night, and that woke me. But, the rest of my family was not bothered by it. Otherwise, it was a nice place to stay on a budget. We don't go for fancy accommodations, we go to see the sights.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18972371">Stayed at the Moore of 4 nights in July 2008. The location is excellent, central for what you will want to see in Seattle. Not far from Pike Place Market, close enough for breakfast! We were in one of the top floor rooms with a shared bathroom. Generally, it was just OK, BUT FOR WHAT TOU PAY, I don'tthink it can be bettered. It is clean, comfortable, and excellent value for money<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18659386">I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights. The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle. The hotel itself is old, but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls. The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable. I was pleased with the staff, and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out. All in all, it was a great stay!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR18616540">A friend and I toured Portland, Victoria BC, and Seattle at the end of July. We stayed at Marriott properties in the first two cities, and we knew the Moore was a different type of hotel, but we loved the location and the price. For $95 nightly, we had a very basic suite-type room that had been converted from two separate rooms - one with a private bath and one with only a sink. As requested, our room was on the back side of the hotel away from the street, so it was very quiet, other than some banging of doors in the morning as other guests came and went down the hallway. There is no a/c, but this was not an issue as the late July daytime temps never got above 70 degrees during our stay. Our bathroom was nice-sized, with a claw-footed tub/shower combination with good water pressure. Water pressure in the bathroom sink was a little weak. Arriving on the last ferry from Victoria, we checked in after 10 p.m. The clerk who helped us that night, Bob, was very accomodating and even provided us with three different options for dining that would be open late. The next day he helped us with recommendations for more dining options in Capitol Hill. He was very patient and thorough each time we came to him with more questions. If you need luxury, you'd be much more comfortable in one of the $250+ hotel rooms in the nearby chain hotels. If you're looking for a basic room for a great price, the Moore's a good option.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18510042">My husband and I were on a 12-day trip to Los Angeles, Seattle and untimately San Francisco. We spent 3 nights in Seattle at the Moore Hotel. I have to admit, I am cheap when it comes to paying for lodging, especially if it's only to sleep (and not taking advantages of any amenities), which this one was. But, on the other hand, you do get what you pay for. We were on the 5th floor. It seemed that they were slowly remodeling the hotel because the 3rd floor seemed newly painted and had nice light fixtures in the halls (though didn't see the rooms) , as opposed to our floor that was dingy and creepy, kind of like the place in The Shining. The room was basically that. A decent sized room with a dresser, TV, nightstand with phone and bed. There was no desk or chair. There was nowhere to sit except on the bed. The walk-in closet was nearly as big as the room but that was a non issue for us. No A/C but a small fan on top of the TV. We didn't need AC as the weather was cool in late July. BUT the downside to that was that you had to open your windows.... (not a place for small children as there weren't even screens) to get a breeze. That made for a terribly loud night's sleep. The carpet was creepy (not necessarily dirty, but dingy) and I kept shoes on my feet at all times. The bathroom was the pits. It was old and you had to step up about 18" into THE smallest shower I've ever seen. The thing that killed me and I'm not sure why but the toilet didn't have a cover. Just a seat. Like you're using the bathroom at a rest stop. Since the bathroom was so small, there was no place to put your toiletries and I was afraid that anything I precariously perched on the edge of the sink was going to fall into the toilet. I carried on a lot about the toilet not having a cover and I think my husband got tired of listening to me but I just found it really strange! (We stayed in a Quality Inn in Los Angeles for less than Moore Hotel and the QI had coffee makers in the room AND continental breakfast (and FREE parking) and was way nicer than Moore.) The positive of the place is that the location is BONUS and the rate is fair, keeping in mund what you get for that rate. It's about 3 blocks from Pike's Market which is central. We walked to the space needle and I'd say it was a good mile's walk, but definitely do-able. There's coffee about a block in either direction, but you still have to LEAVE the building. Another minor benefit was internet access in the lobby but even though they post a 15 min time limit, it was in use all the time. I probably wouldn't stay here again. I've never stayed in a hostel, but this place is what I think a hostel would be like. I'm too old for that!! If you're young and/or don't care a bit about amenities this place is fine to sleep, though the bed was cheap and semi-comfortable. This place epitomizes the phrase "You get what you pay for".

<comment category="positive" id="UR18445990">Great stylish hotel for not a whole lotta cash - steps from the Pike Place Market, Belltown and the Space Needle. Staff was welcoming - didn't blink an eye when we showed up with our three kids five-years-old &amp; under - even rustled up a crib for us. Mix of back-packers, hipsters and euro-travelers. Awesome dive bar on the first floor - which the kiddies prevented us from checking out - next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18349682">The Moore Hotel gives you the option of staying in a great location in Seattle for not a lot of money. Other than that, there isn't much to say. The room was nicely sized but awkwardly laid out so you couldn't really use the space. The bathroom was really small and old. You get what you pay for, though, and this hotel is a clean and a good deal for budget travel in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17827782">We booked Moore hotel after reading all the positive reviews on Travel Advisory. I generally find the reviews helpful, and thus thought all the good reviews for the Moore Hotel were an indication of a potentially positive experience and I really looked forward to it. On the contrary, it turned out to be a very short and bitter experience. Okay, it's low cost, and in the end, you get what you pay for. But it just does not deserve all the positive reviews... The one and only elevator broke down (not the first time according to another guest), so that was a struggle for someone at the 6th trying to bring luggage up or down. No airconditioning, but instead a small fan was provided to help the guest battle the July Seattle heat. The telephone was poor quality and one could hardly hear the other line. Parking was a block away, meaning one would have to walk a block back to the hotel even late at night in a neighborhood of old buildings, homelesss and lower-end nightclubs. The window pane in our daughters' room was broken and was open and difficult to close. The allegedly excellent staff were not very helpful. When my daughter complained about the broken lift, the comment was there were a million and a half other things to do. A sketch to tell me where the secure parking area was located was inaccurate and I had to drive around several times before finding it. One chap behind the counter was completely useless, just giving me a blank stare whenever I asked a question. He was the one who drew the inaccurate map to the parking lot. When we complained about the broken window, we were told that there was no risk since the window could not be opened (which was not true) and and anyway the hotel would not offer that room if it were not safe. We stayed all of one hour. We booked two rooms, but we only occupied one room while deciding whether to stay or move elsewhere. When we finally decided to move, they insisted that I pay for the full night for both rooms, even if we didn't touch the other one (we did go in and have a look). I had no choice but to pay, otherwise they would just charge my credit card. They gave me a statement but no receipt, and had absolutely no sympathy for our situation, insisting that this was a business and that their policy was what it was. After this experience, I will now have to check twice as long and hard at the reviews to make sure I won't get fooled again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17790580">We needed a place to spend the night on our return to the states from Canada as our flight left in the am. I wanted to be near Pike Place market so my son could see the fish throwing before we headed to Sea-Tac, I found the Moore, and couldn't belive the rate ($80/nt plus taxes and fees in downtown Seattle!). It seemed a little sketch/hostel-y on its website, and in my 30's with a child I'm not too into that, but the reviews were such that I felt that we should give it a shot. It was wonderful, the staff was nice and helpful, check in was a breeze and it was obvious staff was attentive to who was entering the hotel to make sure they belonged there. Our room was right on the street (6th floor), but a fan was in the room and once turned on you couldn't hear any of the traffic down below. The bathroom had been recently redone and was neat, clean, and attractive. The room was large, and the beds comfortable. Add to that the the location is unbeatable - this hotel is a jewel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17355274">I stayed here for one week at the beginning of May 2008. This is seriously a really great hotel in Seattle. The price is right, the location is brilliant, and the staff are friendly and helpful (Bob who works afternoon/evenings is a goldmine of information on where to eat, where to go and what to see). I stayed in the room without a bathroom (it just had a sink) on the 5th floor with a view of the sound (with a foreground view of a rooftop carpark!) I found the room big and clean, the bed comfortable and the tv had a zillion channels! It was a tiny bit annoying that the wifi doesn't really work in the rooms, but it can be accessed in the lobby. The shared bathrooms were cleaned everyday and didn't smell bad. The floor I stayed on was not a renovated floor - so be sure to ask for a renovated room. The hotel is old, so the hallways are a bit dark and overall the hotel doesn't look like a new modern/contemporary hotel. The decor is kind of old too, but the location (2 blocks from Pike Place Market) and the price definitely makes up for this. I would definitely recommend this place! (If you stay here, grab a pastry and coffee from Pike Place market for breakfast!)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17326074">We stayed at the Moore hotel for 5 nights in May. Location is great, only a couple of minutes walk to Pikes Market. Room was spacious and clean, bathroom was good. Even though it is in an older building, everything in the room was in good working condition. Excellent value for money considering how expensive hotels are in Seattle. Friendly front desk. We traveled with our 1 year old, and there is a crib available for use. (There was some confusion when we arrived as to whether the hotel does have portable cribs - but they do!). Would definitely recommend the Moore hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17023617">May 23rd 2008 we stayed before our Alaskan cruise. Found online and researched the hotel. The best choice for location to Pikes Market and downtown and best value in town by far. We stayed on the 3rd floor, great room-size perfect; daughter loved the clawfoot bathtub. Thought the room was well done and the bathroom was a good size. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Easy to find and reach from the airport. We stored luggage in the morning and came back to check in. Same the next day before leaving-we stored and checked out and then went off walking again. Would stay again when visiting town.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16784905">I stayed at The Moore a few years ago by accident. I had booked a place online that turned out to be a total dump when someone on the street recommended The Moore as a safer, bargain-alternative for a friend and I. We found it pretty bare bones but clean and with friendly staff that made us feel at home. Coming back a few years later, it appeared the place had a bit of a facelift- some new paint, upgrades to the room, etc. It is still pretty basic: a smallish TV and not much else in the way of amenities but the bed was comfy and the room clean. The place has some cool history and the room, despite the recent coat of paint, had some funky touches: big ol' Victorian bathtub, noisy but quaint furnace in the room, etc. The Nitelite Bar downstairs is also superconvenient if you want to stay close to the hotel but go have a drink/bite to eat. On the subject of convenient, that is probably the best thing about this place: the proximity of the hotel to Pike Place, shopping, the Seattle Art Museum, etc. etc . Great place to stay on a budget esp. if you don't want to rent a car and want to hoof it around the downtown!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16461252">We had just returned from our Alaskan cruise vacation, and the Moore hotel is only 5 mins taxi journey from the pier. If you have a small bag, its walkable. However, we had a lot of luggage so had to get the taxi. It cost no more than $8. The Moore Hotel is in a fantastic location. Just a couple of blocks away from the pike market place and Westlake centre. The rooms were huge and the walk in closet was excellent. We booked two rooms and stayed for 1 night. The rooms were ready when we checked in at around 10:30am. The bathroom was very clean and the reception staff were very helpful. There is also a free wireless internet access in the lobby if you have your own wireless enables laptop. Also, there is fixed computer in the lobby which offers free internet access. There is no breakfast nor complimentary coffee, but who needs that when there are 100s of Starbucks around you! I would definitely be staying here again if I visited Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16357357">My children and I recently stayed at the Moore for a few nights and found the hotel to be just what we were looking for--great location, clean room &amp; a fair price. Pike Place Market, Westlake Center &amp; Belltown are within very easy walking distance (a couple blocks), so we left the car parked during our entire visit. Our room was average sized with a lovely walk-in closet. We also had the shared bathroom &amp; found it to be clean in the early morning &amp; not crowded. Our room was cleaned well each day &amp; the bedding was of average age/quality for an inexpensive hotel. The desk clerk, Robert, was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in suggesting things to do/places to eat with children in the area. I'd read reviews about the elevator being scary, but don't agree--it's a small elevator &amp; old, but seemed quite safe &amp; not inordinately creaky. Overall, I felt it was a great place to stay for the price &amp; will return.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15614188">I spent two nights at the Moore. I'd really like to give it a 3.5, but I can't. The Moore is a really cool old hotel in an excellent location to walk around Seattle and see the sights. Also in a good spot for nightlife and funky restaurants. I checked in late the first night, and the staff was very accomodating. My room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and I had a great view of Elliot Bay out my window (7th floor). Although I was right near the elevator, I could only hear minimal noise. No shampoo or conditioner, but ehn, I brought my own anyway. I just parked on the street, which is free from 6pm to 8am. At 8 I came out and paid the parking meter. $3 for 2 hours. Then I picked up my friend from the airport and we drove to Vancouver. We returned to Seattle for our final night, and our stay was slightly less great. Our room was still nice, freshly painted and clean, but the faucet for the shower was falling off and very difficult to use. The night staff on this night was also not very friendly. I interrupted a 20 minute conversation between the desk agent and a guest for some information (I was using the guest computer, while I waited) . The clerk was very unhappy, although the guest seemed relieved. It was great to have a guest computer, but a printer (for a boarding pass) would have been very welcome. And they will NOT print it for you. I'll stay again, but I'll save my questions for the friendly and helpful day staff.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR15069143">I have stayed in this hotel on several occasions when I have had to work so late I did not feel like commuting home. It is a very basic hotel but it is far and away the least expensive you will find in downtown Seattle by a hefty margin. I have always requested the European Rooms (Shared Batchroom) because they are even less expensive and I have always got what I expected, a Clean bed and a no-frills room. The shared bathrooms are clean if you get up early, but wait until after 9am and its bit messy. My only recomendation is that you request a room on the backside (alley) or a top floor room, as the street will get a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights. As for the neighborhood, it's no less or more safe after dark than any other downtown location. It is also close to Pike Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14223392">The Moore Hotel is the best deal in Seattle. On a recent winter weekend, they were charging half of what the other downtown hotels wanted. Don't let the somewhat shabby lobby scare you off. However, while the front desk staff is great, service is lacking. A broken light fixture in the closet went unrepaired despite 3 requests. (Aren't energy effiicient light bulbs great.) Also, avoid the rooms with bath down the hall. Finally, ask for a quiet room away from the 2 busy streets. You can't beat the location -- close to Pike Place Market and the restaurants and shops of Bell Town. Take the 194 bus from the airport--just a $1.50 non stop.<topic>none</topic>

My girlfriend is the type to always seek out the hotel were she can have room service for every meal; she loves to be waited on. Well, we missed out departing flight and were stuck in a city with ZERO rooms available (Neil Diamond was in town). We needed to book a room fast. I got online and found nothing, and then I came across the Moore Hotel. Not only did they have ample rooms, but the rate was CHEAP. My girlfriend complained the entire way to the hotel, because it wasn't the Hilton, Four Seaons, etc. She nicknamed the place the "No-Moore Hotel" befre we even arrived. Once we arrived, the hotel had SO much personality. Everything was exceptional, rate paid considered. We will both be staying here every time we visit Seattle.

<comment category="positive" id="UR12311235">When booking this hotel online we were pretty skeptical. The images of the hotel were not the best and the description was pretty vague. The price was right for our budget at the time so we took a chance. Very glad we did, this hotel was charming and historical. Outside: From the outside the hotel looks â€œwornâ€�, something you would expect from a 100 year old building. Parking is hard to come by anywhere down town in Seattle, so the Moore is no exception. Plan on paying for parking; use the parkade across the street. It gets locked up at night, and since crime is a big issue in down town Seattle it will just give you that little extra piece of mind that your car is locked away. Parking will cost you $20.00 per day in the parkade. Lobby: Once you step inside, you are greeted with a marbled reception like area. Friendly staff to check you in promptly and help with any questions or concerns. The building has a very outdated elevator, something that is par for the course considering the age of the building. The hallways (corridors) are extremely wide. Something you just do not see, it was refreshing. Rooms: There are two types of rooms available in this hotel. There are the ones who have stood the test of time and those who have been decorated to meet todayâ€™s style. We were lucky enough to be told up front and requested a new room. Here you get the privilege of having your own personal bathroom. Thatâ€™s right folks, not all rooms have their own bathroom. Some floors have communal bathrooms so be sure to ask for an updated room. The room we stayed in was on the 7th floor. It was spacious, clean, funky paint job, and looked over the harbor. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was a great, inexpensive way to be in the heart of down town and not in one of those â€œstuffyâ€� hotels. The Moore is very close to the Pikeâ€™s Market, about a 5 minute walk at the most. Shopping centers, movie theatres and numerous restaurants all within a 5 minute walk as well.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12020791">Considering the exorbitant hotel prices in Seattle, the Moore is really good value for money. The front desk is really helpful in providing you with tips on where to go and how to get around. I had a huge room on the 7th floor where I could see the bay. It was such a joy to wake up in the morning to that view. The location is good too. I could get around conveniently without much hassle, though the bus stop is at the next block. Nevertheless, it's a stone's throw away from Pikes and 5th Avenue. And if you are brave enough, you could actually walk to Pioneer square down 1st Avenue, or to the Space Needle in the opposite direction and that's nearer. Even though it's next to a theatre, The Moore Theatre, I'm not sure if there are actually performances. I checked it out, and the box office seemed perpetually closed. One caution though. If you are walking back late, the route along Stewart Way gets a little dodgy. The bar next door also tends to have people lingering outside after dark. So be on guard.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11529423">Let me start off by saying that I rated this 4 stars for the atmosphere and hotel staff, not for the hotel property itself. The rooms are no more than 2 star at best but its located in a great downtown Seattle location. There is no parking other than lots and the street (I'll go into that later). You can walk around all of downtown from this location. We heard of this place from Trip Advisor and it ranked high as a budget hotel. At over $100 + per night in December, wasn't precisley a budget hotel. We chose a room/suite that had kitchenette and it was room 705. Initially, we had 605 but becasue there had been smokers inthere before us, they were in the midst of fumigating the room. It was on the backside of hotel and slightly less noisy than the front (apparently) because of traffic. The front desk staffer, Robert (Bob), was an extremely helpful person who gave us a myriad of ideas on restaurants and places to visit , shop, etc. I have read other reviews that included him on this site and they stated he wasn't helpful and they didn't like him. Far from the truth in our case. The room was fairly big with a sitting room and a separate bedroom. it had a dining area and a small kitchenette. The view wasn't much but we were there to walk around, not look out the window. Very small elevator (eclectic again). The clawfoot tub and shower system was interesting if not a bit cramped. Lots of space to store stuff. TV was small and had a lousy remote but again wasn't why we were there. We didn't go (but heard lots about it) was a restaurant/lounge called the Nite Life. Apparently good food and awesome drinks, the Long island Ice tea is supposed to be spectacular and they never heard of a too strong drink. We went to a few local restaurants, El Malecon, Mama's Kitchen (awesome Marg's and Elvis Presley burrito plate!!) and Ivar's Seafood buffet. Elliots looked good but the 2.5 hour wait turned us off. Parking in Seattle is a nightmare or expensive or both. We happened to be there on a NFL Seattle Seahawk football game weekend so that added to the parking trauma. If you like spending $20-40 per day for parking, then no problemo, there'll be parking for you somewhere downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10984870">We're from South Africa and stayed here for a night before cruising to Alaska. OK, on the positive side, the rooms were large, staff friendly, and we got an early check-in. Plus it really was cheap. It was clean, and one could easily walk down to Pike Market- about 4 or 5 blocks. So pretty convenient for one night. On the downside I have to say it really is very basic. Bed and Tv, that's it. And the surrounding area shuts down real early as there's nothing around it. So to get a bite you'd better leave early or alternatively be prepared to travel! But for a single night? Just fine.<topic>none</topic>

If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10592485">Stayed one night at the Moore Hotel because of the value and location of the hotel. I am not a super picky traveller and only really require rather basic amenities while traveling. Upon entering the Moore, one can tell it is a rather old hotel and building. The scariest thing about the hotel is its elevator, which if you have a fear of elevators, it will be brought even further to light when going up this elevator. It's creaky, small and just old but scary because of it. The room itself was nicer than I expected. It was a typical budget hotel room, with comfy beds, a nice view and a tv set. The bathroom could use a renovation and had some mildew around the shower's edges. Additionally, the shower stalls drain was extremely slow, causing some water to overflow from the shower stall and onto the bathroom floor. (Hence, probably the reason there was mildew around the shower base.) A nice touch was that the towels were all folded into shapes to create a very lovely presentation. Even the toilet paper roll was folded into a seashell shape. Overall, the stay was nice and even though we had a room that face 2nd Street, there wasn't much traffic noise at all. Additionally, there was a show at the Moore Theatre the night we stayed. However, that show seemed to end by 11 PM and even when it was occuring, there wasn't much discernable noise coming from it to our room. All that said, I was able to soundly sleep at the Moore. The hotel has great character and charm and once you get past the scary elevator, you realize just how many people have walked and stayed in these rooms. If you require newer surroundings with updates, I wouldn't necessarily think this is the place for you. However, I find its history and charm to be insurmountable and for the right person, this is the perfect place to stay. I wouldn't be surprised if those halls are haunted!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10583989">The Moore only looks a little sketchy from the outside. Once you're inside, it's solidly average and a great value in Seattle, which has outrageously priced hotels, for some bizarre reason. We went into our stay open minded, not expecting any more than cleanliness and a great location. Yes, the rooms are spartan -- we opted to "splurge" on a room with it's own bathroom rather than to share. The tub/shower was fine -- an old clawfoot tub, which was cool. However it was very difficult to regulate the hot water and I got scorched a couple times. The initial staff that we dealt with when checking in were very pleasant but the night clerk, Bill, is a total jerk. One of our pillows was exceptionally flat and when we came in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30pm, I asked for an additional pillow and another bath towel. Bill rolled his eyes and acted like I had asked him to jog around the block twice in his undies. As Bill complained and slammed things around in a storage area behind the desk, I told him, "Nevermind -- I'll make due." He responded with a snarky, "Yeah, I'm just going through the motions here." In other words, he was just pretending to look for a pillow. What a jerk. Other than Bill, everything was fine at the Moore. The location is perfect, our room was clean and comfortable. However, I can imagine that in the summer it must be hot as hell on the upper floors and there is no air conditioning. Probably fine for most of the summer but if you got an unexpected heat wave, it would be really uncomfortable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10429776">This is an affordable downtown hotel that has recently been renovated, it appears. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is great, but do note that this is right downtown, so there is plenty of noise. I slept just fine with earplugs and the windows closed. If you're there during a heatwave, you may be sorry you chose this hotel. There is no A/C and the portable fans provided in the room are tiny. The hotel has no parking, so expect to pay $15-17 a day in nearby lots.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10286362">My fiance and I were in town for a wedding and did not want to break the bank. Thanks to a write-up in the Lonely Plant, we discovered the Moore Hotel. The rate was unbelieveable and the hotel was centrally located to many of Seattle's renowned attractions (Pike's Place market is only two blocks). The hotel was quaint and charming and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We convinced four friends of ours to also stay at the Moore, and they were delighted with their spacious suite. Street noise was not a problem for us and we found the surrounding neighborhood to be nice and safe, with plenty of good restaurants. We all will definitely stay at the Moore Hotel again when we return to Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10116571">We recently stayed at the Moore Hotel &amp; had a great experience. No frills, for sure, but our room was big, clean &amp; comfortable. It is centrally located, we could walk to almost everything Seattle has to offer. And the staff was super friendly &amp; helpful, especially Bob at the front desk. The only negative is the hotel is on a busy street, so bring earplugs!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10058499">We had our concerns when we booked at the Moore for Sept 6 &amp; 7, because you get what you pay for, right? And any accommodations anywhere else would have been more than triple. We were very pleasantly surprised! We got more than we paid for. The rooms were clean and spacious with character. Even though Megadeth was playing at the theater, we slept soundly. We will absolutely stay there again. The location is excellent. We used the city bus service, so parking was not a problem. Although there was no air conditioning, open windows and fans kept us comfortable. Splurge on the John Malkovich suite if it is available (private joke, you'd have to see it.)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10017368">I stayed here for 2 nights in a single room with shared bath. The room had a sink with mirror, small TV, small fan and large closet. The building is old and the rooms have seen better days, especially the carpets. The bed sheets were scratchy - no Egyptian cotton here! Shared baths were clean. Bottles of cold water could be purchased anytime for $1 at the reception. Staff were friendly and helpful. The sliding lock on my door was broken, but I could lock the doorknob with my key. My room overlooked the street at the front of the building and the traffic noise was bothersome, especially the night of the Torchlight Parade for Seafair. The fan helped that a little. The second night, there were people talking loudly and walking around all night and their voices echoed in the halls. It sounds a little miserable, but it's no different than a youth hostel. The location can't be beat, so if you need a cheap place to crash downtown, this place is good enough.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10007391">I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems. I always book in advance and pay with my credit card. Last time they asked for my drivers license. With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down. The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room. I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID and My group went there instead. I reported them to Visa.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10003037">We stayed at the Moore for 2 nights prior to our Alaska cruise trip. The Moore locates in a very good location. You can walk to the pier, pike place market and downtown area easily. I went jogging along the waterfront and to the nice park and enjoyed it. We walk to our NCL Pearl at Pier 66 to board our ship and it is a nice walk downhill. So, location is excellent for the price. The hotel is not fancy but clean. We spend a little more to have our own bathroom, instead of sharing, which is worth the money. There is a small TV, but no refrigerator or drink. But, that is not a problem because you can walk to buy all the stuff you want nearby. This hotel is good for budget traveller who wants to stay near downtown area. By the way, we have a great time in Alaska and NCL pearl is fanstastic.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8885557">As a single young woman traveling alone, I was a little wary as to what the hotel/surrounding area would be like. But the Moore Hotel felt safe and in a great location for the price I paid. The only time I really felt scared is when I arrived at 3am due to a delayed flight. and had to walk a couple blocks to the motel from the bus stop. (I know, not the best situation for any area of any big city) No one gave me problems, but just be aware that it might not feel completely safe walking in the area alone late at night. The motel is just a short walk from the Pike Place Market and bus routes to other places. I even walked to the Space Needle from the hotel, but it is was quite a long walk. I was most impressed with the housekeeping staff! They deep cleaned my room between the nights of my stay. They also have origami washclothes/towels every day. I chose to share a bathroom ("European style") to keep things cheaper. The bathrooms were clean, but other hotel guests frequently had left their towels laying around and a hair or two in the tub. That didn't bother me, but it may bother some people. If you showered first in the morning, you'd have a completely clean shared bathroom.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8840358">We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle, and we certainly got that. We got one of the suites on the 4th floor, and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky). It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet. Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite. Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms. It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom! It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college. On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe. It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd. When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in. I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8737736">My boyfriend and I are both students and booked into The Moore for a weekend away. We paid $66 plus taxes a night for a double room with no bathroom. This was during what is still considered â€œhighâ€� season in Seattle (Seattle being what I consider to be an expensive hotel city, but I digress). Look, The Moore isnâ€™t fancy, but for $66 what are you expecting? Our room was on the 7th floor. It was small, but CLEAN and I felt SAFE which is all that matters, to me at least. The bathroom and showers were just down the hall, but I never encountered any one when I went to use them. The staff are very helpful and kind. Yes, there is some noise from the street and The Moore theatre below if there is a concert going on. As for the â€˜streetâ€™ people, theyâ€™re harmless and left us alone, which was refreshing (considering weâ€™re from Vancouver where you can encounter aggressive panhandling) and I felt pretty safe in the area. The Night Lite lounge was great for a quick drink, $3 beers cant go wrong!. Great location, 2 block to pike place market, 2 block to GREAT shopping in the Pine Street area. The hotel is also in the middle of the â€˜freeâ€™ zone for busses, which makes it pretty cheap to zip around down town. We were so busy out seeing Seattle we didnâ€™t spend much time at the hotel, except to sleep. Ask for a room higher up, youâ€™ll encounter less noise.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8697237">This hotel is about 3 blocks from Pike's Street Market and 11 blocks from Amtrak station. That is one of the reasons we chose it. Problems: It's really old and needs renovation, there is no air condition, there are street people hanging outside the door, there is no parking for the hotel, parking behind hotel is $7 for 2 hours, there are night clubs opened most of the night so you get entertained wheither you want to or not, you can't close the windows because there is no a/c, some of the windows are at fire escape so you don't want to leave them open, and last but not least, the mirror in the bathroom opens to the outside.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8518801">Absolutely great hotel! When I saw the outside I thought it might be a bit run down but I found no problems. It is a little dated looking but I thought everything was fine. The 2 guys on reception were really helpful with tips of where to go and were really friendly. There is free internet in reception for hotel guests although it can get a little busy at times....guests are asked to limit to 15mins a go. The room I had was on the top floor (7th - I had asked for a quiet room). It was large, roomy, clean and great views of the Olympia mountains! The bathroom was clean and even had origami towels. Had a bath/shower so you could chose and a fridge too. There is only 1 lift and it is a bit old and small but it never broke down or anything when I was there. The area is not the greatest but then a lot of Seattle I found to be the same. I walked everywhere and had no problems. The hotel is a 15min walk or so from the Victoria Clipper terminal. Its right beside Pike Place which is a lively place with loads of places to get breakfast and stuff. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the shopping hub with all your shops. I loved the hotel and would have no problem staying there again. The price was great too!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8513014">I read many reviews on citysearch and trip advisor re: Moore Hotel. Called to book; only "shared bathroom" queen room was avail. I lived/traveled in Europe for over a year; didn't think shared bath would be a problem. However, fiance and I shared a bathroom (one toilet, one shower) with an entire floor (we stayed in room 403). That is, 25 rooms: 1 bathroom. Yes, you read correctly, 25 rooms with at least 2 people in each room, and ONE bathroom. Everytime, day/night/6am/midnight/noontime that we tried to use shower, it was busy. Paper-thin walls, no shower, toilet so far from room, tiny room with dirty sink in room, and smaller-than-reserved-bed...well, we were miserable. Asked to change rooms but were told they were full. Tried to find another hotel in Seattle for under $150/night, impossible. Loved the town but will never, never, never stay at this hotel again. Passed many homeless/drunk/druggie-looking types on way to hotel each night---for sure I wouldn't have felt safe without my 6'5" fiance on my arm. Wanted to warn everyone with our experience--try to stay in Capitol Hill or Belltown, both close enough to downtown action/shops/mass transit and far enough away to enjoy more of "the locals' Seattle".<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8434586">We stayed in this hotel two years ago and had a good experience then (obviously, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered to come back this year). The hotel is clean, friendly and it has a nice authentic touch. We stayed for four days in two adjoining rooms with a bathroom in the middle. The rooms had enough space, the beds were okay and we liked the antique details like the lamps and the doors. Also great was the distance to Pike Place, shops and restaurants (Crocodile CafÃ© is fun, also for breakfast!). The bathroom was a bit small but the shower was hot and the origami towels were really nice. But... don't expect roomservice or fancy shampoos. Accept that (in the weekends) there is some noise from the street below. And don't bring to much luggage, for it might not fit in the elevator in one time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8249481">After seeing a large renovated suite in this hotel, we booked months ahead so our daughter and her friends could see a concert there. We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival. When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation and that that room was booked. We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend, so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying. They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead, one renovated where the kids stayed, and one that had not been renovated. Had difficulty locking the door to one room, lock seemed out of alignment. My wife hated the room. There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning, she had trouble sleeping. The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street, while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away. Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people. Parking is terrible, expensive. .<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8218838">This "boutique" hotel is different because it is very plain. No a/c, small tvs, and minimalist decor. This is NOT a fancy place, but it is the right price for budget-minded travellers. The biggest problems are: 1. PARKING- The hotel has no parking and no agreement with local garages. You'll wind up parking nearby for about $20/day with limited access to your car, especially after dark. 2. Neighborhood- While it is two blocks from the Pike Place market, the street is a little rundown and a little shady after dark. The street noise might keep you awake at night in the summer. 3. Maintenance- The hot water did not work in our bathroom sink and the elevator is small and noisy. After 9pm, you have to use the elevator All those things being said, you cannot deny the value of this hotel for its location. Just be prepared to get the level of amenities appropriate for your money.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8204534">We stayed for one night at this hotel, which is clean, quiet and has a great, central location. Not to mention having reasonable rates! I would say, however, that the hotel is still undergoing redecoration and we were given a very drab room that had us thinking of the song "Hotel California". On the other hand, we DID arrive prior to check-in, but the staff were very friendly and could see we were eager to get settled. Had we been patient I am certain we would have been put in one of the newer rooms. The Pike Place Market is two blocks away (downhill), and Belltown is right there so there are plenty of options for dining. Seattle is also a very walkable city (aside from some of those hills). I am not the type who really takes decor into consideration, though. All I really want is a room for a reasonable rate that is clean, quiet, comfortable and located in a good area. And the Moore Hotel certainly met all of those qualifications. They also have cable television and free internet access if you bring your laptop. If you're expecting doorman service, bellhops, extra linens, etc., this is not the place for you. That kind of hotel you would spend over $200 a night for.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8030000">I love old hotels! When I was searching the web for a place to have a mini-family reunion, I was pleased to find the Moore Hotel. One could tell that the owners are trying to keep its 1907 flavor. The ceiling lighting fixtures and cast iron bathtubs were true to the hotel's era. The Moore reminded me of some of the hotels that I have stayed in in Europe. We had two private sleeping rooms with a Jack-n-Jill bathroom on the 6th floor. One room had a queen bed and the other had two twin beds. The beds were very comfortable. The furniture was your basic budget hotel variety and was well kept. The closets were huge. I enjoyed looking out the windows at the different periods of architecture in the area and the bits of the waterfront that could be seen beyond the buildings. Our rooms were basic, but very clean. There is no air conditioning, but the windows opened to allow for a nice breeze. Each room also had a fan. The staff was the best!! Everyone aimed to please. They guided us to some great eateries, explained the parking situation so that we were able to stretch our vacation dollars, and helped us polish off a birthday cake from Cold Stone's Creamery. There is a room where the management will hold your luggage after checkout time if need be. The location was great! We were two blocks up from Pike Market, four blocks from the car rental office, and four blocks from the mono-rail station that took us to the Space Needle and Seattle Center. We encountered some homeless people in the area, but we also encountered them in other parts of Seattle as well. None of them were rude or forceful. The area around the hotel buzzes with nightlife as there are a variety of clubs in the area. This was a plus for us as we had a birthday in our group that needed to be celebrated with more than cake and ice cream. The only drawback that we encountered was the noise from the street. We used our portable radio as "white noise" and were not bothered by the traffic sounds. We will definitely be back!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8001197">The Moore Hotel itself is an excellent place to stay for the money but not so much if you are driving a vehicle. Parking is a bear around the hotel. We had to wake up at 7:00am every morning when our overnight parking expired to pay additional fare, we spent almost $100 in parking fees. I would definately stay there again if I flew to Seattle but not if I drove.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8000535">My husband &amp; I stayed at The Moore 6/9/07 &amp; 6/17/07 (before &amp; after a cruise). On our first stay we arrived before check in, but when the desk clerk heard our story about being stranded by the airport shuttle in the rain without our suitcases &amp; not knowing where we were, he volunteered to find us a room we could check into early. The room was VERY clean &amp; I thought it was alot larger than some newer hotel rooms. The tub is old, so it was huge! You can lay down in it. The bed was comfortable.Our rooms had recently been redone. In the morning we asked the desk clerk were we could catch a cab to the terminal, she said have a seat and I'll call you one. Did'nt expect this much service for the price. On our second stay we arrived very early, 8:30(cruise ships are in at 6AM). The clerk stored our bags for us &amp; told us that check in wasn't until 3PM but that we would probably be tired by than &amp; to come back around noon &amp; she would have a room for us. She did! Both rooms we had were near the elevator, it didn't bother us at all. We delt with 3-4 different front desk employees, all were more than friendly and very helpful. We did see some homeless in the area, but no one bothered us. TWO blocks from Pike's Market &amp; walking distance to the water, Seattle Center, the monorail &amp; more! This was a bargin of a lifetime. About a block away is the Virginia Inn. We had a great dinner there on our first night. Lowell's in the market is really good for breakfast (ate there both mornings). Met friends there our first day for lunch, the clam chowder is horrible. Ivars on the water has the best clam chowder I have ever had.(Had this the second time thru Seattle) Another great bargin. The double decker (narrated) bus tour.. $18. per person, good for 2 days. Ride it all around, get off when you want ,sightsee, walk around..get back on when the next bus comes thru..do it again,all over town. Stops about 3 blks. from the Moore.

<comment category="positive" id="UR7990275">We stayed in June for 3 nights. It is definitely a no thrills place but the room we had on the fourth floor was massive, with a new carpet, comfy bed, clean sheets, walk in warbrobe and a sink. The toilet and shower room were across the coridoor. They could have done with a refurb but shower pressure was great and they were clean. It is really close to Pike Place and pretty much every attraction is in walking distance (depending on how far you fancy walking). The decor is alittle on the dull side but nothing to really bother about. Staff were really helpfull and friendly. Location is fairly safe (we didn't have any problems) but Seatlle does have its fair share of crazies but they are pretty harmless. The bar next door is one you would not normally go into if you were in your home town but we popped in for a cheeky cider or five and ended up chatting to most of the locals who were really cool, even if a little rough around the edges!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7779723">The Moore is nothing fancy, but it provides clean, spacious accomodations within spitting distance of Pike Place Market. Folks could complain about the decor, and rightfully so--the lobby and hallways are drab, the rooms are on the dim side--but it is a budget hotel after all, right? The furniture and carpet in our room looked newish, the beds and bathroom were clean, and I'm not sure what more you can ask for at the price. Speaking of which, prices are reasonable, with few rooms topping $100. We had a double queen room for Memorial Day weekend and paid only $92 per night. Rooms a few blocks away at the Westin and other similar chains were easily double that. Lobby staff was helpful and friendly, and there is a large, secure room for storing luggage after you've checked out. The crowd at the attached bar /restaurant was sparse, and the place put off a slightly depressing vibe. For a good breakast, hit the Crumpet Shop at the market or the Crocodile Cafe a few blocks up on 2nd. Overall, the Moore is a good budget option right near the market, waterfront, ferries, downtown buildings (check out the public library), and bus lines to all the neighborhoods. Can't say we'd want to stay in Belltown again (a bit sketchy at times--safe, but sketchy), but we'd definitely stay at the Moore if we did.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7682021">The Moore is quirky, clean, and an amazing value for staying in downtown Seattle. My husband and I rented a suite on the 7th floor with my MIL for Mother's Day, and we had a wonderful time wandering the market, visiting the Sci-Fi Museum and Experience Music Project, as well as taking in a Mariners game at Safeco field, which is about a fifteen to twenty minute walk away. Comfortable queen and twin beds, great little kitchenette, dining room table, and our own bathroom for less than $150 in downtown Seattle on a Saturday night -- this is unheard of at any other property in the area. Perfect place to stay if you need a safe place to crash for the night downtown. Noisy? You're in the middle of downtown Seattle -- what do you expect? We heard the usual assortment of vehicles and city sounds, but no problems with our neighbors in the hotel. The elevator is tiny and old, but I consider that to be part of the charm. If you are high maintenance and need every detail to be spit and shine, stay someplace else. If you like staying in an offbeat hotel and want to be in the center of everything, this is the place to book.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7670228">This is a fantastic value for the money! I hesitated before trying it because of the negative reviews, but in my experience a 3.5 average TripAdvisor works for me, so I went for it. The only way one could be disappointed with this place is by having unrealistic expectations. I made my reservation directly through the hotel website, choosing the $52 "European" queen/single adult, which turned out to be Room 711 facing the water. I checked in on Saturday afternoon, after 2:30. The room itself, the sink and the linens were all perfectly clean in appearance, feel, and smell. The tap water tasted fine, although I let it run for a while before filling my glass since it's an old building. The decor is not worth mentioning but just to be complete here it is; hodgepodge cheap motel style, which by definition is unattractive, but it wasn't remarkably ugly. There were 3 sets of towels, 4 cups and 4 bars of soap. There's no clock, but you can ask for a wakeup call, or use the TV to keep track of time (reception wasn't great on all channels, but the news &amp; weather were fine). The toilet across the hall was a little concrete cell, but it was clean. The full bathroom right around the corner was roomy, clean, and dry. I didn't use the sink because I had one in my room, but I had no problem getting plenty of hot water for my shower. The water pressure could have been stronger, but it was adequate. I never had to wait for the toilet or the shower, nor did I have people waiting after me to use them. There were some rowdy neighbors late Saturday night, which I expected, but I'm an easy sleeper so it didn't bother me. There was some street/city noise from outside, but nothing extraordinary if you've ever lived in an urban setting. My time in the room was spent either getting ready to go out or to sleep... I wasn't around to experience noise from the theater downstairs, so I can't comment on that. The homeless are very direct in downtown Seattle, but they're also quite "professional" so it's not that big a deal. My impression was that they were just exercising their right to ask me for money and in turn, they respected my right to say no. I really enjoyed my stay because it was no fuss, no frills, and no ugly surprises, so I could concentrate on other things. Even though it was inexpensive, I never felt, "Oh no, I should have splurged on better accommodations!" which has definitely happened to me before. I'm going to stay at The Moore again on my next Seattle trip.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7552782">Felt like a weekend away from the wife and kids (more wife than kids to be honest- I know she wont read this !!) Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver. Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget. Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be. On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check in was turned away as place was full-so book ahead. Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean. No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs. The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.Ok so 125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote- 125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on. A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of said remote-shrug of shoulders-"our guests take them home you know" set TV to CNN for duration of my stay. Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/ Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ? no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pm and Sunday all day free. Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m. A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room, not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle and splutter and keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlites decide its time to go home.I nod off into a fitful sleep. Something about this hotel though-somehow its quaint and pleasant in an obscene kind of way.Was almost sorry to leave-or was it teh thought of another Monday at the office looming large ? Give this place a go-just catch up on sleep before you do.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6800830">My husband and I stayed at the Moore for 3 nights while attending a professional conference in Seattle. The hotel lobby is pretty spartan, but the front desk staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay. There is one free internet terminal in the lobby, but we did not use it. Unlike many similar hotels I've stayed in, the elevator at the Moore is modern and pretty speedy, though small. Our 7th floor room (714 - single queen bed) was clean and comfortable, with a nice view of Puget Sound over the rooftops of neighboring buildings. We enjoyed watching the ferries come and go. Amenities were minimal (no clock in the room, no toiletries beyond basic soap, poor TV reception) but we felt safe and comfortable for our entire stay. The building has been renovated, but historic touches, like original solid wood doors and old-fashioned brass keys, remain. Lack of water pressure and temperature regulation in the shower are my biggest complaints. We didn't have any problems with noise. The location was excellent; within easy walking distance of the convention center and major hotels where our conference was located and major attractions such as Pike Place Market. The neighborhood felt reasonably safe. We arrived by train and found it easy to hop on a city bus that took us almost to the door of the hotel. The bus ride was free because it was within Seattle's downtown "fareless" area. Overall, we were very satisfied with the Moore.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6333093">Stayed in the corner suite on the 7th floor. Room was nice from the walls up, but the floor squeaked horribly, everywhere. We had not been informed of the "no guests" rule when I made the reservation--only the people sleeping in the room may enter it. Definitely the kind of information you want before making a reservation. The people at the desk when we checked in and out were nice, but the night man was AWFUL. My roommates got on the elevator at the same time as someone in another room who had brought a guest. The night man stopped the elevator to badger those people, and couldn't get the elevator restarted, resulting in my roommates having to climb the 7 flights of stairs (while one of them was still recovering from a bad back injury). BUT THE WORST THING OF ALL was when the night man took one of my friends to be a drunk and refused to rent a room to him. My friend has cerebal palsy, and happened to be the headliner at the Moore Theater that night. Overall, it was a bad experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6133661">We looked for a long time to try and find a reasonably-priced hotel for the 4 nights we would be staying downtown. As you might imagine it is very expensive to stay downtown Seattle. In fact the West Coast has a much higher cost-of-living than Milwaukee. We checked out chain hotels, discount travel sites, and bed-and-breakfasts â€” but ultimately it was a travel guide (Frommerâ€™s 2005) that suggested The Moore Hotel. Itâ€™s 2 blocks from the Public Market and sits on a main street (2nd ave) 1 mile from the train station. Itâ€™s 3 blocks southeast to the West Lake bus tunnel and there are literally dozens of cafes / clubs / and shops in every direction. We walked from the Amtrak station to the Hotel with our luggage when we arrived; and we walked from the Hotel to the bus station when we left - ideally situated for use of public transportation. We opted for the $55/night room which has no bathroom (â€™european styleâ€™). This was half the rate we found even at most â€˜discountâ€™ chains. The bathroom was about 10â€² from our room and we had our own key - so even though it was not a â€˜privateâ€™ bathroom, it was never inconvenient. The picture on the Moore website is not one of the european style rooms - ours was much smaller. The hotel was built around the turn of the [20th] century so thereâ€™s a lot of historic details that make it an exciting place to stay - tall ceilings, lots of windows, exposed woodwork, wide hallways. And most (if not all) of the 7 story hotel has been refurbished with new carpeting, fresh paint and retiled floors. In fact, the room we were in had brand new lamps, bed and TV. There is also a phone in each room (dial â€˜9â€² to get out) and basic cable. The only negative observations about our room were that the sink (all rooms have sinks) had no hot water pressure and Harmonie thought there should have been a full-length mirror and there was no clock. We were on the 7th floor - room 711 to be exact - and were afforded a great view of the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. Iâ€™ll upload some movies when I have some extra time so you can get a feel for the layout. I would highly, highly recommend staying here if youâ€™re ever in Seattle - and ask specifically for room 711 as some of rooms are in-facing (thereâ€™s a kind of a â€˜courtyardâ€™ space running up the center of the hotel so that in-facing rooms can open to the fresh airâ€¦ but itâ€™s not a pretty view) and some of the south-facing rooms are on an alley. There is also 1 public-use internet terminal and wireless access in the lobby. The workers were very helpful with suggestions and they provide a big rack of literature for tourist-y things-to-do. The clientele seems quite mixed, with a lot of younger / international travelers as well as some older. I didnâ€™t see any families. There is no pool or arcade, but there is an adjoining lounge/bar and theatre (which was, unfortunately, playing â€˜Annieâ€™ while we were there) which gets touring bands every now-and-then. Also thereâ€™s no breakfast or coffee. There is also an elevator for those that donâ€™t like walking up seven flights of old-timey stairs. So, once again - the Moore Hotel comes highly recommended.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6111643">The Moore appealed to my friend and I because it was in downtown Seattle and was, by far, the most "bang for our buck". At $70 a night in the downtown area, we didnt expect much but after reading the reviews, we looked forward to seeing the charm of a well- taken-care-of hotel from yesteryear. We didnt find what we were looking for. Our room was a sloppy mix of one picture of a skyscraper, furniture from an office in Hawaii in the 80's and an awful lamp that had a crack on one side. Although I craned my head out of the window and got a magnificent view of downtown, I tried not to open it that often due to the bad draft coming in. We had no shampoo for the shared bath down the hall. One of the toilets had a problem and you had to push a button inside commode to flush it. And if we hadnt had a small desk fan in the room for quiet noise, we would've heard everything downstairs. We were SEVEN floors off the street. As we wandered the hallways, we found that there was nothing charming about the hotel other than its old fixtures. The whole place is in dire need of plants, pictures and color. Parking was an absolute nightmare; THIS HOTEL HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY OF THE PARKING GARAGES OR LOTS. It was "every man for himself" and more than slightly frustrating. Although the older front desk clerk kindly explained the procedures, I found it very inconvenient to have to get up at 7am or 8am and run down to pay for the parking after already paying for it overnight. The Moore did have something going for it: a very awesome location. Only a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and anything else downtown. That was about it, however. Good price? Yes. Good location? Absolutely. Worth it? No.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6012436">Given its central downtown location and low price, the Moore is a very good value for a two-star. For the price, it's not fancy but adequate, clean, and roomy. The elevator and hallways are small and rather dingy but the rooms are fine. Beds are good, TV has sufficient channel selection, telephone, bathroom normal size with adequate motel-type towels/face cloths, soap, no shampoo, etc. There's no air conditioning, but there's a small fan in the room that was barely sufficient. Being from a rural area, we didn't find the street noise to be bad at all and we were on the front of the hotel facing 1st. Ave. It's about what you'd expect for a city but not objectional - running the fan for some "white noise" helps. We would definitely concur with other reviewers that an upper floor (5 or higher) is definitely recommended. They have free internet service in the lobby as well. The staff was not overly helpful or friendly but provided acceptable service. The best thing was it's central location to Pike Market, good restaurants, and all the downtown sites within the free bus ride area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5814218">I recently visited the Moore Hotel with my family for the purpose of doing some sightseeing and to take in a couple Mariner baseball games. I booked a couple rooms for a long weekend, having stayed at the Moore previously on recommendations from friends. My family completely enjoyed their stay. There are three things about the Moore Hotel that make it a hotel I highly recommend - the character, the location and the value. The Moore is one of Seattle's more historic hotels with the charm of a bed and breakfast. Though an older building, it does not lack in comfort or amenities. Rooms are extremely generous in size. They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere. The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games. And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all. The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

<comment category="positive" id="UR5811391">Is it spartan and dated: charmingly yes! So for the traveler who appreciates a clean, classic hotel in a prime, downtown Seattle location, this is for you. We've twice chosen the Moore for a pre-cruise stay with our kids in a suite of two conjoined rooms seperated by the bathroom. It's right downtown, so there is typical noise from trucks/sirens; but the beds were comfortable and showed no sign of bugs as others claimed. My only caution is to use the same ordinary caution outside as you would in any urban area after dark. The staff is incredibly cool, accomodating and provide free internet access in the lobby to check email, etc. I have recommended this hotel to like minded frugal friends and look forward to the next time we visit Seattle for another stay at the Moore.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5811189">Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks. The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met. I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room, he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue. Very, very dissapointed.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5724517">The best part of the hotel was the staff. I enjoyed sitting in the lobby watching the goings on. Interesting and nice people. They have a computer set up in the lobby for you to use as you wish for free. I was able to check emails. I booked the hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was prepared for anything. I booked it because I did not want to spend 170 and up for an overnight before a cruise. You enter a small lobby with a few chairs to comfortably sit in, and one person working at the desk. A 2nd person is usually in the office next to the desk. Check out when parking is free on the streets before you pay 10 dollars for about 10 hours of parking in the lots. I think we could have saved 10 dollars if we read the signs. They are extremely nice and helpful. I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed them. You then take an elevator to your floor. When the elevator door opens, you start to giggle. "I can't believe I booked this hotel". I hope you have a sense of humor, or don't expect much. Expect the worst for ambience. The hotel is old. Very old. The walls have been painted over in a very dark color, along with almost black colored carpeting in a wide hallway. You get the feeling of entering an old dormitory at an old, and I stress OLD, school . You walk down the depressing hall to the door (which has one real key even if you have 4 people in the room). You leave the key at the front desk when you leave if others might need it to get in. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room. There were 4 of us. The bed was comfortable enough. The decor was 1944 bland. There was no place to put anything down in the bathroom, like a counter. The toilet was so close to the wall on its left that your butt hit the wall if you sat down. You had to sit more to the right. The flusher hit the wall, so they cut a hole in the wall to be able to flush the toilet. The shower was fine. Fat people could not use the facility here. Not in my room. There is no screen in the window and no air conditioning. We left the window open all night (birds could have flown in as there were many), and traffic noise went on. I had no problem sleeping, but others could not stand the sound of traffic. I was exhausted and crashed with no problem. Staying near Pikes Market means you are in the run down part of town. I would prefer to stay in a nicer section. I did not realize how scary it could be.You are literally a 5 minute walk from the Market, and a block or 2 further to the waterfront. It is all downhill, so remember you need to walk back up again. During the day it was ok. We walked past a lot of scary people. I would not go out at night. I did get up earlier than the rest of the group, and since I had no place to watch tv without disturbing them, I went downstairs. They told me there was a McDonalds that opens at 630am. I walked there. about 3 blocks.I met all the drunks in recovery while I bought my coffee. Starbucks opens at 7. I brought the coffee back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, comfortably reading until about 930 when others got up. Seattle seems to be the most expensive city in the country. I don't think you will be murdered if you stay here, but I think I would prefer to stay at the airport the next time I overnight for a cruise. Or in a nicer neighborhood. If you walk in the opposite direction from your hotel you come to a really nice (expensive) section with Nordstroms, and all sorts of expensive fancy stores. A nice area. Way too expensive to stay there. There is a steak house across from the hotel (on the corner) that I really wish I had a chance to visit. It was Argentina beef and I remember that being awesome when I had it in the old days. I bet it is good.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5700717">No frills, but clean, unique, and in the city center. The Moore Hotel is in an old building with a marble entryway and lobby. We stayed in rooms with private bathroom inside the rooms, but "European" style shared bath rooms are also available. The rooms we stayed in had wooden doors, and the bathtubs inside had "feet" like old-style bathtubs, though these also had shower connections. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, though there was no air conditioning. Windows open onto the street, which means that there's some noise from the street. Staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about things to do in the city. We compared notes with some folks staying at a local youth hostel and found that our private rooms in the Moore Hotel were about the same price. Since this is one of the least expensive places to stay in the city, I would recommend it to anybody looking for budget accomodations with old-style character. Most of the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle are within walking distance. We found the neighborhood to be safe. There's a single free Internet terminal in the lobby for those wanting to check their e-mail.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5661558">My husband and I booked a room at the Moore Hotel based on all of the glowing reviews and the amazing price (we paid $89.01 for one night in downtown Seattle). Although the price was great, the room was less than great. Nothing was technically wrong but everything was very very old and smelled very strongly of cleaning supplies even after I opened the windows for several hours. And, I am usually not bothered by "downtown" noise, but the windows must have been incredibly thin because I woke up multiple times due to sirens and other noises even though we were all the way up on the 6th floor. On the other hand...like I said above, the price is hard to beat for downtown Seattle and the location itself is great! We were within walking distance of great restaurants, nightlife, Pike's Market, and the waterfront! So...if you are looking for a nice and relaxing place to stay, the Moore may not be it; but...if you are looking for a cheap (and clean) place with a great location, the Moore is for you. One more thing...parking. The Moore does not have a parking lot or garage so you have one of three options: (1) park on the street after 8/9ish at night for free so long as you wake up and pay the "meter" at 8AM the next morning, (2) get to the hotel before 8/9ish (call and see what time) and park in a garage across the street for $15 for a day a think, or (3) park in one of the many lots around the hotel but pay a lot of money. We ended up parking the car on the street because we got to the hotel too late to park in the cheap garage; then, in the morning (8AM), we moved the car into one of the lots around the hotel for "early bird" parking ($10 for all day).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5623382">The Moore Hotel is an older building, yet scrupulously cleaned and maintained. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The prices were great. However, its chief advantage is its location. At the corner of 2nd St. and Virgininia, it is only two blocks from Pike Place Mkt! It is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center area. One block either way puts you on major city bus lines to connect to the stadiums to the south, or the Space Needle to the north. Airport transportation via the Shuttle Express vans drops you off/picks you up at the door of the moore for a great price. Two cruise lines dock at the waterfront directly below the Moore, but HAL and RCL dock closer to the Pioneer Square area. We stayed two nights pre-cruise, and two nights post-cruise at the Moore and felt it was a bargain. I would advist to request the upper floors, as street noise was noticeable in our room on the fourth floor. Also be aware that there is no air conditioning, but this was not a problem at all during our stay in August, 2006. If you want luxury and pampering this is not the place for you. However, for a clean room at a great price and in a great location, the Moore is the place. I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5589917">My boyfriend had stayed at the Moore Hotel 6 years ago on a cross-country trip, so when he suggested that we stay there on our recent trip to Seattle, I let him take care of our vacation plans. We took public transit ( MT194 / $1.25) from SEATAC, which lets you off 3 blocks from the hotel - an easy walk. This place is fantastic for the money if you don't require a lot of "extras." They offer shared and private baths (the private baths go pretty quickly), and we tried out each. Even the shared bath option gives you a sink in your room. The hotel feels much like a hostel at first - it's old and not in the best visual condition, the hallways are a little dark, the elevator only holds a couple of people, and the doors to the rooms require *gasp* actual KEYS! The neighborhood is a little gritty, but we never felt unsafe at any time. It is a highly trafficked area, so you're seldom wandering about by yourself. Once inside the room, it's a pretty bare bones setup, but everything was super clean, functional, we had a fantastic view of the water, and the building is constructed like a prison (thick plaster walls), so we never heard a peep from our neighbors. The close proximity to just about everything is amazing - we walked to Pioneer Square (~25 minutes), Safeco Park (~35 minutes), Pike Place Market (less than 5 minutes), and took a quick bus ride over to the Seattle Center. This place is central to everything you'll need to explore Seattle efficiently and thoroughly. If you're into fancypants-type accomodations and need a lot of catering to, this place is not for you. There are no clocks in the room, no pictures on the wall, you may/may not get a mirror in your room, but the place is well worth the money that you'll save, and the service that we received from everyone working there was 5-star. They definitely have a lifelong customer in my guy and myself. The Moore Hotel is located smack on the border of Belltown, which is loaded with great eats, great bars, and tons of twenty/thirty-something hispters. For food, check out Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, OHanas, and Caffe D'Arte for awesome coffee/teas (skip Starbucks/Tully's). For entertainment, the Virigina Inn is a nice place to grab a beer, while places like Lava Lounge, Shorty's Coney Island, and The Whiskey Bar are more chaotic, but still good fun. The Palace Kitchen is a great late-night option, and they serve free pistachios at the bar.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5560470">I was worried when I got there...it was an hour or two before check in, but the desk staff made it seem like they didn't have my registration. This was after e-mail contact and a phone call with my credit card. They wanted me to come back for a 3:00 check in. They stored my luggage and the hotel is within walking distance to EVERYTHING downtown, so it wasn't a big deal. When I got back at 3 though, I don't think my original room was ready yet, but they gave me a room on the 6th floor on the side street (above the theatre, perhaps?) No view, but the side street allowed me to have the window open all night (no air conditioning- it's alright!) That being said, this is an awesome hotel with friendly staff and people staying there, and it's right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, so the location can't be beat. A car is not needed. Walking and busing got me everywhere I needed to go! I travelled solo (29-year-old male) and felt completely safe everywhere I went, but it you are a nervous traveller, this might not be the place for you. Rooms were simple, the age of the building gave it some character. Appreciated the fan in the room- wouldn't have slept as well without it. I would stay again next time in Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5508003">The Moore SO exceeded our expectations!! People seem to love or hate it. We did reserve one of the suites, which we're guessing might have been in better shape than the standard rooms, b/c otherwise I can't imagine such complaints as I see here. It was clean, stocked with bathroom basics (which i did not expect, given the no-frills descriptions), the room was huge, the location excellent. Given that it includes shared-bath rooms, there were some hostelers (tho the desk clerk noted they get the "good" hostelers b/c they require a credit card deposit), but also other middle aged and older couples. Staff was great and gave great restaurant recs. One item to note: the hotel is over a theatre, and when a band was performing, it was loud, even up on the 5th floor! However, the front desk told us most acts are over by 10, which is what we experienced. We will stay nowhere else in Seattle now (if we can get that suite)!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5480157">RE: review of the Moore Its a little wordy but it speaks to the character of the Hotel and the people who run it. First we had never heard of the hotel but wanted to find a place for a night that was close to interesting city life (not really spent anytime in Seattle before) and was relatively inexpensive (budget) and also a place that was in an area where we felt safe to explore as well as one that was safe and clean to stay in. When my wife called the hotel number she got "Bob" on the other end, he absolutely was the reason that we decided to book a night at the Moore, in one phone call Bob answered every question she had and made her feel at ease about all her concerns (as listed above), still we thought that the price (for what he said on the phone about the area etc) was too good to be true. We arrived on the evening of July the fourth and Bob was working the desk, after meeting him we knew that he wasn't acting on the phone, VERY helpful and personable, every question again he answered and we were relieved and impressed. The room was great, very clean, quiet, it was everything we were hoping for. As we were there for only one night we didn't get to explore much but we felt like if we were to return that the Moore Hotel was for sure the place we would base out of next time. So we left the next day to camp in Oregon for a week'ish, we decided though to cut the camping short by a night and head back to the Moore to see more of Seattle, we were all excited feeling comfortable heading back to Seattle knowing that our nights stay was not a concern at all. So as if I wasn't impressed enough with the Hotel and its staff they went one step farther, as we pulled up to the Hotel after an 8 hour drive I see "Ray Davies" on the marquee for a show at the theatre that night, being a hobby musician I thought I would see about getting a ticket as the rest of the family wanted to walk around and shop, the manager of the Moore Hotel overheard me in the lobby and said that if I left my name with Bob that he would leave me a ticket for the show, this is right after I found meter parking right outside the front door of the hotel!!, I almost went and bought a lottery ticket I was feeling so lucky. Anyway a long story short, the show was great, I had a blast seeing Ray and being that I enjoy old buildings I was feeling very fortunate to be seeing the show (at no charge!!! things like this don't happen to me) in a theatre with such rich architectural character and history, it was an evening to remember, and it was all thanks to the Moore Hotel Mgt and staff. So big Thanks! to the Moore Hotel staff for the generous hospitality of the free ticket, and for the worry free couple nights stay we had, when in the area again we will definitely return to the Moore. If you want the perfect balance between cost, location and quality, absolutely stay here. -Russ Saskatoon, Sk, Canada<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5476016">I stayed at the Moore for 2 nights recently and as most other reviewers posted, it was great for the price. ROOMS: The Moore offers both rooms with private baths and rooms with shared baths. You'll save about $15-20/night if you take a room with a shared bath. I was a single traveler and took a room with bath for only $65/night. The same room for two people in it would have been ~$80/night. You won't find a lot of amenties, but at this price, I didn't care. Like there was no shampoo or even glasses for water, but this was a very small inconvenience compared to all of the other great pluses (price, location, etc.). The rooms themselves were very clean, if a little worn in places like the bathrooms. Also, they were fairly large, so you won't feel like you're living in a closet. LOCATION: It can't be beat. It's between Pike Place and Belltown. The walk to each is about 3-5 minutes, if even that. TRANSPORTATION: From the airport buses (174 and 194), it's a 5-minute walk with luggage. You're also close to a ton of bus lines. I was able to save money and not get a car because of the great location. I took buses to the University district, Madison Park, Fremont, and Capitol Hill. All of these bus stops were about a 5-minute walk away as well. INTERNET ACCESS: There is one computer terminal in the lobby you can check email from for free. Free wireless internet is also available, but only in the lobby. STAFF: I found all of the staff I interacted with to be extremely helpful and friendly. CHECKOUT: Checkout is a little on the early side at 11AM, but I was able to secure a late checkout (noon). On busier days, I still think they would let you have a late checkout of 11:30AM.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5473111">I did not feel safe at this hotel. Couples may feel more comfortable but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice. I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller]. When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite and the other night I would have to move room and share a bathroom. Totally unacceptable as a lone female. When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere. Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else]. I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5444055">We stayed here before a cruise last week. The location is great, the price is right, and the rooms are decent. The staff was very helpful. If you want to pay $250 a night for a few hours in a room go ahead, but I would saty here again in a minute. The bathroom was fine. Small TV, but your not there to watch TV. Don't expect the Ritz, but you will do fine. You can keep your luggae in a closet while you chaeck out Seattle before the cruise. Take a Taxi to the cruise. They will call the cab.

<comment category="negative" id="UR5412914">The Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center &amp; Pike Place Market. Our first room was on the street &amp; was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. The courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early). I'd still prefer this over the budget hotels near Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5374316">As a solo Canadian traveling through Seattle for the first time I am so glad I ended up at the Moore Hotel! I'd been on the road for a bit and my credit cards were running low, about $70 left on my MasterCard. After being turned away from half a dozen downtown hotels I found myself in the lobby of the Moore. The front desk was understanding and set me up with the most affordable, safe downtown room I could ever dream of! I was able to get a huge basic room with beautifuly clean baths and washrooms down the hall. The location is perfect for the city sights and sounds and walking distance to everything. The Bar staff and regulars were very welcoming to a stranger, being a Chef, I soon realized I was in the after work hangout for the downtown service industry. What would be the chances of ending up in the place I'd be hanging out at if I worked and lived in Seattle? I have a couple Seattle trips planned for this year and there is no doubt where I will be staying. Falling in love with your city started at The Moore Hotel! Whistler, BC, Canada.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5372743">I am experiencing the most peaceful and serene time off from work. My spirit has been lifted. Our visit with Jayna was the best. It was raining when we landed at Sea-Tac, but by the time we loaded our luggage into the trunk of our rental car the sun was peaking through the clouds. The weather was cool, but when the wind blew it made the hair on your neck stand up. The Moore Hotel was nice. Our Room was on the 6th floor with a panoramic view of the Puget Sound. The room was clean and comfortable. If I could make a suggestion to the proprietor, it would be to put a small shelf in the bath room and a place to hang your robe behind the bathroom door would be nice. This hotel is in the heart of Downtown Seattle, a block east of Pike's Market Place and a block west of Nordstrom's. We spent a small fortune in parking, but all in all it was worth it. The Mariners swept the series with the San Francisco Giants. Barry Bonds hit a home run his first at bat. So did Ichiro. Day 2 Mike went to the ballgame with his brothers Randy and Steve for game two of a three game series. It was Gay Pride week in Seattle. Jayna and I exhibited our diversity and joined the festivities at the Fremont Street Fair. This is it's 35th year of celebrating the Summer Solstice. It was a large diverse group of warm bodies. Belly dancers, floats and naked men and women (sporting only body paint) danced through the streets raising awareness to the needs of low-income and the homeless community (the 6 foot tall stuffed penis got my attention). The fair is free but donations are accepted. Donations received directly fund Fremont Public Association (FPA). The fair was loaded with exhibits, art, crafts, musical entertainment and food. Jayna and I escaped the hot pavement and retreated to a Thai restaurant. I had the Cashew Chicken with vegetables and rice, YUM! Jayna had the Chicken Curry with noodles. Afterwards, we met Mike and his brothers at Ivars to say our goodbyes. Then Mike, Jayna and I took the ferry over to Bainbridge and headed towards Port Townsend. Day 3 Jayna's friend Shannon was a life saver! Our reservation at the Water Street Hotel (WSH) was nearly lost. But Shannon was able to retrieve our room key before 6pm. Thank you Shannon! The WSH is very old. It was built in 1889 by EH Fisher. The Hotel offers a beautiful view of the Puget Sound, Mount Baker, the Cascade, and Olympic Mountains. It is in the heart of Downtown PT Historic District and within walking distance to shops, and restaurants. The festive spirit of Gay Pride week followed us up to Port Townsend. The WSH is above the Water Street Brewing and Ale House. The Ale House offered a masquerade/costume party on Saturday evening. The music was so loud you could hear hear it three floors up. The patrons partied until the early morning hours. The featured entertainer was DJ Ramiro. For breakfast we went to the Landing Restaurant. Jayna suggested the Baked Blueberry French Toast stuffed with Cream Cheese. Oh my Gawd! I highly recommend this one. Afterwards we walked out onto a pier and watched as boats docked. Then walked through all the shops downtown. The shops are all quaint and tastefully done. My favorite, was "Maestrale". An eclectic collection of old and new. I found the cutest cobalt blue antique drawer pulls. ~Cute-Cute-Cute!~ That evening we ate dinner at the Fountain CafÃ©. We had dinner salads with Honey/yogurt dressing and Taylor Gold Pears. Our meal was the most flavorful blend of Italian cheeses, noodles and chicken. Most people call this Chicken Fettuccini. I say it was the best I've ever tasted. For dessert we shared a CrÃ¨me Brule. Oh My Gawd! This is the best restaurant in the world. We had the best waitress, the atmosphere was delightful and the Art exhibit was colorful. Day 4 We checked out of the WSH, then went to visit Jayna's friend Joe. He is a Barista in uptown PT near Aldrich's Market. Joe makes a mean latte. Day trip with Jayna to Fort Warden and the beach. We hiked to a remote cliff face with a 500 foot drop. Scary! Then we took a long long walk along the beach. We laughed, talked and reminisced. It was a good day. We took Jayna back to her house and made the drive back to Seattle and then home. I miss her.

<comment category="positive" id="UR5362871">I loved this hotel even though my husband had his reservations about it at first. He did NOT want a room with a community bath (which are cheaper) so I booked a suite for a little over $100. It was quite large, 2 rooms, brand new sofa, furniture, minimalist decor, little kitchen, TV, clawfoot bathtub, comfortable double bed, and freshly painted. We had a great time walking around the Marketplace and surrounding area. The desk clerk was very helpful, telling us where to park (across the street $15) showing us how to catch the free bus to ChinaTown and how to get back. We even went to hear live music next door at the Moore Theater! If you want a place with character, and not a generic chain hotel, this is the place! Do be aware that there is a significant amount of homeless people, panhandlers and dope dealers, but I find this element in most major cities in the U.S.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5351404">I just got back from a five night stay at the Moore Hotel in Seattle. For $65 a night I paid it was an amazing deal! My room was on the 6th floor, and I had views of the bay. The room was large, clean and quiet, if somewhat dark, and the staff was friendly and helpful. the one drawback was the clawfoot tub in the bathroom had no decals or bathmat, so if you are not careful it can be a bit slippery. The front desk does not provide bath mats, so you may have to spend three or four bucks on one while you are there. The location is also really convenient, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market, and within easy walking distance of Pioneer Square and the main shopping area, as well as the location to catch tourist buses and cruises. Also, the Metro bus (which is $1.25 to $2.00 depending on the time of day) to and from the airport is just two blocks away. Would definitely stay there again when I go back to Seattle, and at those prices I can certainly afford to!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5316440">I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle. It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market and the major central tourist attractions are within easy reach. If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable. Several of us stayed there and we were all happy with the value for money and service.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5313438">We stayed at the Moore for two nights right after Memorial Day, in a standard room with 2 double beds and a private bath on the 7th floor (719). The room was huge, while sparsely decorated. The bathroom was average - small, and there was a large walk-in closet. There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle. The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room. The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated. The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone, so you don't have to walk if you don't want to. Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night. I'd stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5291915">My friend and I stayed at the Moore for one night during the memorial day weekend. I booked a hotel in Seattle for the rest of the stay and just needed a hotel for the first night--which was difficult to find since all the hotels seemed to be booked on that night. So I found the Moore as a fluke through tripadvisor.com-- I did a search for hotels that were under $100 dollars a night in the downtown region and the Moore came up and ranked #15 of all seattle hotels. I read through the reviews and was a little nervous at first since some compared it to a hostel or sleazy motel. But I noticed those reviews were quite early and the most recent reviews were pretty favorable so I decided to book. Plus the night my friend and I arrived in Seattle we had to catch a show at the Crocodile Cafe--which was only 3 blocks away from the moore. When we got to the hotel, we observed how a couple in front of us were treated since there was a mix up with their reservation. apparently they reserved two queen beds with private bath, but since there was a glitch in the reservation system (that neglected to acknowlege that the two queen rooms were sold out) the person at the front desk offered the couple a room with 2 beds and a single that was connected together at a discounted price. When it became our turn to check in, he did the same for us except we got a room with 1 queen bed and 1 and twin bed. The person at the front desk was really nice and cordial. Now on to the actual hotel... The room was decently clean but no frills--lacked little amenities such as remote control. But I think the lobby had a free internet terminal and I saw a few people downstairs using wireless. Since the moore is located in the heart of Seattle's trendy Belltown neighborhood as soon as you step out of the moore, there's tons of bars and restaurants at your feet at night, and litlte trendy shops and salons to visit in the day. Pike Place Market is an easy walk as well. So it's not bad considering the price (esp with the 10 dollar discount) and convenient location, so it's definitely recommended for students or others on a budget.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5289730">The other reviews seem to have it right - best part about this place is the location. Easy walking distance to everywhere. We were on the top floor, so we weren't kept awake by any street traffic, but I can't vouch for the lower rooms. Reception were friendly, and the price is great for Seattle. Only negative points were a dingy little bathroom and a fairly small lift, but who cares?<topic>none</topic>

It had just been painted so was as good as new. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and there was free internet access in the lobby. The hotel is situated a couple of blocks from Pike Street Market and the major shops, and about a 15 minute walk from the Space Needle.

<comment category="positive" id="UR5231999">THis hotel couldnt be better placed and it was fantastic value for money. It was very close to Pike Place Market which is great and full of culture. It is not too far from the Space Needle and EMP plus downtown and shops. Our room had a view of the sound which was a lovely view. I was definately pleased with this hotel. It was centrally located, safe and clean and the bed was comfy. THe only thing I could find wrong, and even then it was not a big issue, was the bathroom was a little dull, but you dont go to seattle to spend each living second in the bathroom! The swans that they made from towels were great! One last thing, if you get the chance whilst in Seattle, go to Mt St Helens, you can get a greyline tour or you can do it by hiring a car. its fantastic!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5191434">If you want a comfortable, affordable place to stay with your family while visiting Seattle, you can't beat the Moore. If you want the Ritz, make your reservations somewhere else. There were nine of us in our family group. Grandparents, children, ages 7 and 8, parents and aunts and uncles. We arrived on AMTRAK at 10:00 PM on a Friday night and walked all the way to the Moore Hotel. It was a weekend so there was plenty of activity on the streets and we felt perfectly safe. Lots of couples walking together. If it is night and your are a single woman, or it is raining I would suggest a cab. It is about a twelve block walk from the train station. A little bit more if you are taking in the Mariners or Seahawks. During the day we walked everwhere. Pike Street Market was just two blocks away, so you can get up early in the morning and head down to get a cup of coffee and watch everyone set up before the crowds arrive. Tully's and Starbucks one block away. I patronized the Starbucks in the morning for our coffee and cocoa and a few pastries. Friendly young lady working in there that remembered me each morning as I came stumbling thru the door. The Athenian at Pike Street serves an affordable family style breakfast. Also CJ's on 1st was a good family restaraunt. It was about 5 blocks from the Moore. The guys in our party found a large army surplus store a few blocks away on 1st. Seattle Center with the Space Needle and Science Center was a close enjoyable walk. We met people at the Moore who were walking up to 6th Ave to take in the jazz music. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom had plenty of towels and a good shower. We had two rooms to accomodate all of us. Room 424 had two rooms with a total of 5 beds. Windows aren't spotless, but they open so you can get a cool breeze. It was warm while we were there, not sure how warm the rooms would be if it is chilly outside. If you want lots of peace and quiet this might not be for you. Street was noisy till about 2 or 3 AM. We were all tired from our busy days so it didn't bother us. About 6:00 AM the city comes alive again. We had a small view of Elliot Bay from our room. Did not have a chair to sit in so we could look at the view. I did meet one gentleman in the elevator at 7 in the morning who was grumbling about having to feed the parking meter so early. Sounds like that is a Seattle downfall. Staff was very friendly and had our key ready for us when we would return from an outing. Only one key per room, so we left it with the front desk when we went out. I can't wait to go back! Even if I went back by myself as a single woman, I would stay at the Moore.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4971670">The reviews on here are not always spot on but most times they come through. Not with the Moore. These reviews must be written by the owners or something because this place reminded me of something between a hostel and sleazy motel. The lobby is falling apart (like most of the building)the rooms are big, i'll give them that, but the bed sheets were torn and stained, horrible old mattress, pillows that me think it would be better if i laid my head on a brick. The place wasnt super dirty but it was not kept up. I realize its old but its just not worth it at any price.<topic>none</topic>

The staff is friendly and is always willing to give you suggestions on places to go. It's just up the street from the Pike Place market which you have to visit even if you are only there for the day. Also very close to capital hill, the space needle, crocodile cafe, etc. All this and at an incredible price too. I will only stay at the Moore!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4707041">This old hotel is in a 7 story building built in 1907 that includes the Moore Theatre, a busy concert hall. Not sure how much of the fixtures, including granite shower enclosures, glavanized pipe and cast iron radiators are original, but they take you back, in a good way. Clean and functional. We paid $79 for a high ceiling-ed suite, two rooms, each with a queen bed and cable TV, and a bathroom between. On the 6th floor, we had a view of Elliot Bay. $15 for 24 hours at the parking garage directly across the street. Cheapest overnight parking in Seattle.

<comment category="positive" id="UR4359189">My fiance and I stayed here over Thanksgiving weekend. He wasn't sure that I had found a "deal" and teased me all the way from Portland that I had found a dump. I have used trip advisor for work though, and most the reviews were good, so I went with it. We are young, and even if it was a total flop, it would have been a good experience. When we got to the hotel, the clerk, was quite the expert on the local night life, and gave us a map that he marked with all the local bars and walking distance. We had a great night on the town, and were able to leave our car next door since we had checked in around 7pm the night before ($15.00 for a full 24 hours!)this allowed us to venture out to Pikes Market, and walk down to Pioneer Square after check out. The area is not Posh by anymeans, and neither is the hotel, but it is a bargain, with some unexpected charm, such as marble stairs, red wood doors, clawfoot bath tubs, and thin, but decoratively folded towels. But if poor lighting can be seen as romantic "mood lighting" and you like a clean tub to bathe in with a bottle of wine and enjoy a lively night life without having to seem pretentious to fit in, then this is the place. For a poor young couple trying to pay for a wedding, and a newer car, this is the kind of place we can afford to go to every few months!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4335132">I stayed at the Moore for two nights in the end of December. From outside, the Moore looks like an aged Grand-Hotel which probably had itâ€™s grandeur a long time ago. The worst about the hotel is the lobby, making a run-down and cold impression. Nevertheless, the staff behind the front desk is very friendly and tries to help you whenever possible. The room was large (and heated very well in winter) and even with two queen size beds, youâ€™ll have enough space to walk around without bumping your legs. Although the furniture is modern and functional, there are some interesting details: A spacious old closet with a gloomy light where you could easily place a cot instead of hanging your coat. A bathroom with a ancient clawfoot tub. And a historical ceiling light reminding of past times. The very best about this place is itâ€™s location (5 minutes to Pike Place Market, 10 Minutes to Waterfront) and itâ€™s unbeatable rates. I doubt youâ€™ll find another hotel in Seattle in such a central location for less than 80 US$ (Off-Season). There is a WiFi internet connection you can use for free in the Lobby. Sometimes it even works in your room. Other travellers were not sure if the neighbourhood was safe. I walked there in the evening when it was dark and I never had any doubts. If you prefer places telling a story, places that don't need to be tiptop in every detail, the Moore is a Hotel you definitely should consider staying at.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4316391">This was the first trip for two students outside Canadian borders where I was in charge of planning flight details, lodging and daily activities. The main focus of our trip was to take in a football game, so we wanted a place in the downtown core, central to all the attractions this wonderful city had to offer. Many of the hotels in the core were pricey, but the Moore had a cheaper nightly rate, as well as a 10% off coupon i had found online. Considering the price, discount, location and numerous recommendations, we had no option than to give the Moore a shot, and we were certainly not disappointed! We took full advantage of the shuttle bus (route 194) almost directly to the Moore, and can't imagine how much money we saved between two trips! We booked a 2 Queen bedroom with a view of the sound (as was recommended, and is pictured below) on the top floor. The hotel itself is very basic in regards to provided amenities. Make sure to bring your own shampoo and pack your own mints! The wireless internet was a great perk for minors unable to fully enjoy the nightlife Seattle has to offer. The location of the hotel, while very convienent, manages to make you feel very safe in a somewhat shadier area of downtown. The staff on hand were incredibly helpful in aiding us with transportation tips, sights and attractions, and dining options! In fact, everyone in the city is VERY courteous, pleasant and accomodating! GO SEAHAWKS!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4216887">I booked a room at the Moore for two weekend nights thinking I would get one with a shared bathroom. Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance. It was very comfortable, warm and secure (which in Belltown is always an issue) and the location could not be better. I will definitely be back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4123611">I stayed Moore for 3 nights. I was excited when I found this hotel from this website, sounded fantastic. Maybe that's why I was dissapointed when I stepped in the hotel. It's obviously a budget hotel, not so nice. Some of staff were not so nice like other comments say. But there was at least one guy who was helpful. I stayed queen single room with bath. The room was really large, but the bathroom was old and terrible since it has cracks on the really old tiles etc... and everything in bathroom is 100 years old. Water pressure was weak. Somehow, the furnitures in room are new, so that's good part. I asked room with view, and it had a good view, but comes with some street noise. Anyway, I wanted to save money while close to downtown, it's ok experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4111367">The Moore Hotel is touted as a once grand hotel and serious emphasis must be placed on the 'once'. Although the lobby appears relatively modern, the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s. Rooms are very basic to say the least, but you only get what you pay for and the Moore represents fair value. The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable. Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit. However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming. We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite. Internet access is free in the lobby and the Moore's downtown location is good. Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead. The location is better,safer,cleaner and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3992317">We stayed at the Moore from August 27 - Sept. 2 in a "3 bedroom suite." It wasn't exactly as one would expect: one entered, and had to pass through, one bedroom to get to the others. The bathroom was off of another of the bedrooms. But since we were all friends traveling together, it wasn't too bad. There were doors between each bedroom, so you could have privacy if you needed it. There were no kitchen facilities, but there was a small fridge in one room, and a sink in another. Two bedrooms had tvs. It was a shame to be so close to Pike's Place Market without kitchen facilities, but there were lots of good restaurants nearby. The location was great for being able to see the touristy sites. I took a public bus in from the airport, the hotel was only a block away. In fact, when we finally picked up a rental car, we just left it in the garage for 3 days, rather than deal with the whims of Seattle's meter maids. We had a view of the bay from one room, and the Space Needle from two of the rooms. The bar across the street tends to be a bit rowdy at night, and there was always some "interesting" activity down on the street at nights, but we weren't concerned about safety when walking about late at night. Almost as bad as the bar was a nest of raucous seagulls atop the apartment across the street - who needs a wake-up call? With the coupon, the week cost us $335 per person. It would be hard to find a better deal in such a convenient location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3937733">Spent four days at the Moore, and it delivered what I needed: safe, clean lodging. I went for the absolute cheapest rooms at this, the absolute cheapest place to stay in Seattle (short of a flophouse). The $45-a-night room with no bathroom was fine: spacious, quiet, and sanitary. TV and sink in the room were an unexpected extra at these rock-bottom prices. The shared bathroom just down the hallway presented no problems, and housekeeping kept it clean enough. And of course, you can't beat the location -- two blocks from Pikes place, walking distance to just about everything. Parking isn't provided by the hotel, but there's plenty of parking lots/garages within one block. The garage across the street is pricey and atmospherically gothic, but convenient -- it allows overnight parking and doesn't demand that you show up at 7 am to renew your parking as most other lots do; note that it closes at 10 pm, though. Hint: on-street parking is free all day Sunday.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3930115">We stayed for two nights (Sept 17 +18) while in town to see Dead Can Dance at the Paramount. Coming from Victoria on the Clipper it was $7 by cab (including tip) to the Moore. Check in was quick and front staff were very helpful! Our 7th floor room was charming and very clean. Water pressure was perfect but watch out for the shower - hot was cold and cold was hot - at least in our room. The hotel was quiet - we only bumped into a couple of groups in the hall and yes the noise on the street from the bar scene was noticable but close your window and you won't be bothered. The area is safe and really would you walk anywhere alone at 3 am? We found a coupon on the web for 10% off the already great price. Close to the Market, Monorail, major shopping, a 10 min walk to the Paramount - location cannot be beat. Belltown has many great placed to eat - Belltown Pizza, 2 huge slices and a soda for $7.91. For a late nite snack and a game of Connect Four or an early morning coffee try Nexxus - just 1/2 block to the north on 2nd ave.

The staff was very helpful and friendly, Ed was a dear! Our rooms had all recently been renovated and were lovely. The beds were great. The location is great for being able to walk and see the sights of Seattle. No car needed.

<comment category="positive" id="UR3888534">My friends and I stayed at the Moore Hotel over a long Labor Day weekend and were very pleased. The location offers easy access to attractions, nightlife, restaurants, ferries, and shopping. I did not find the area unattractive in the least. Yes, there were eccentrics and homeless around, but I found that to be the case throughout Seattle. It is located in a very young area, and you may have trouble finding a bar with anybody over 30 inside. But again, that seemed to be true throughout Seattle. We had a nightcap one night at the neighboring Nite Lite Lounge, and enjoyed ourselves, even though it was a young crowd. The hotel is old but clean. I paid $286, including taxes, for four nights in a single room, and my friends paid $311 for a double. You can't beat that price for such a central location. The beds were very comfortable. Every day, the maid would pick up stuff of mine that was lying around and leave it neatly on the windowsill. My only complaint was with the bathrooms. I could not get my shower to deliver both hot water and good pressure, and the shower stall was extremely small. The toilet sometimes had to be flushed twice. Also, there was no plug for the bathroom sink, so I had to put a washcloth over the drain before putting my contacts in. My friends had one of the claw-foot tubs with shower curtain, and said they had no problems with the water. However, their toilet malfunctioned on our last day, and no one turned up to fix it. They were able to use the hall toilet, and the front desk offered to move them to another room, but they didn't want to bother and so just used the hall toilet. The front desk people were extremely helpful and friendly-can't praise them enough. We did not have the parking problems that others have encountered, partly because we stayed there over Labor Day weekend and street parking was free on Sunday and Monday. We had to get up early to move the car once, but we spent a total of $8 on parking the entire weekend, and one night we got a spot right in front of the hotel!<topic>none</topic>

Thanks Bob for alll your help while we were there. The manager, was also terriffic. I had a problem and he allowed me the privilege of sending a fax free of charge from his office. He couldn't have been nicer. The location of this hotel is great. Just a few blocks to Pike Street Market.. (BIG ATTRACTION IN SEATTLE) The rooms are big and the closet is emence. The hotel is not fancy but it is clean, quiet and safe and there is a computer available in the lobby which can be used free of charge and an elevator to take you to the upper floors. Rooms with or without a bath can be obtained. I would definitely stay here again. The city is great. The buses in town do not charge anything. Great restaurants and a fun place to visit and a great place to start off your vacation. We used the Clipper Boat/ferry Service and visited lots of close by places; San Juan Island; Victoria and Vancouver... you will not go wrong if you stay at the Moore. Read the history of the place...which is very interesting....I only wish I had time to visit the Theater next door...which I understand from the Manager/owner it is one of the oldest in the US. Smart ecconomical travelers will stay here who do not require the Marriot ambiance and/or do not want to pay the top prices.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3846689">There's not much more I can add to the other reviews, other than to say that our stay was equally satisfying. I used to live in Seattle so I didn't need travel help from the staff, but they were always pleasant over the phone and in person. I love the location because I could walk to Pike Place each morning and watch them set up the market. It's also great to be able to walk to Bell Town restaurants and the Space Needle. The room was funky and the hotel is a bit cavernous. We had a claw foot tub with a shower - the hot water was so weak that I never added cold when I took a shower - but it was just warm enough to be comfortable. We were serenaded awake each morning by seagulls - something that would not be as much of a problem if we'd had the window closed. But overall, it's a good place to stay and I would definitely stay at the Moore again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3824644">The Moore is an old Hotel, but is is clean, the beds are comfortable, my husband said that the pillows were the most comfortable he has ever slept with. You can stay at any chain hotel and after you check out you can't remember much about it. Not so at the Moore Hotel, first of all the Hotel staff are the friendliest we have ever met, Robert was outstanding. They will go out of their way to help you, in finding a bus, dining spot, events..... When we called to make our reservations we asked about parking our rental car. They told us that we did not need a car in the city, city transportion is free. They saved us over $300, by us not having to pay the airport car rental charge, renting the car for a shorter period of time and no parking charge. We took bus #194 from the airport for $1.50 and walked 2 blocks to the Moore. When we were ready to leave the city we took the free bus to Budget rental and took off to the ferries. If you come into the city by the airport check out the coupon book. The Moore is in the book, which they honored upon check in. We had a room with private bath, which cost us less than $70. The cleaning staff have quite the knack for folding the towels into interesting shapes. While staying at the Moore check into eating at the Farestart Restaurant just a few doors away. It is a food service training facility for the Homeless, every Thursday they have a Guest Chef work with the students making a 3 couse meal, it was fantastic. When we come to Seattle again we will stay at the Moore.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3812479">Entering the hotel was like entering a 2 star European hotel in a major city. Simple, spartan but friendly (minus the smoke). We were there 3 days and the hotel grew on us. It's age turned to charm and the clean and simple rooms a bed and little else were just what we wanted to pay for. We didn't miss the pool, restaurant, fitness center, in-room coffee or any other nice but unnecessary 'frill' provided and most other hotels. At just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market, the location is perfect. The parking shuffle can be an issue - moving from street to lot - but the timing really worked out OK for us. (need to move the car off the street by 8am). The neighborhood seemed safe enough - as did most of Seattle - although the panhandlers around town are a real annoyance. The mayor might do well to read up on Giuliani's program in NYC. Back to the hotel - For the price and location, it's a must for anyone on a budget or just interested in a nice old place in a great location. Just don't expect all those creature comforts....<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3802560">I've stayed here 3 times, and you just can't beat the price or the location - just a couple blocks from Pike Place Market. The first two times we got a room with a shared bathroom ($55 for two people/one bed). However, the last time we stayed, we'd forgotten to book ahead and all hotel rooms downtown were booked up. The Moore had one room left, which was a suite for $120. It was like staying in a large one bedroom apartment, and we thought the king(?) size bed/bedding was of better quality than the less expensive rooms. The furniture was nice, the kitchen and bath seemed newly renovated, and overall it was a terrific value for the space. The suite would probably be good for families, or people who need a hotel room with a kitchen.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3788031">It's a bit assuming to write an excellent review about a hotel as spartan as the Moore but this place is a real "value for money" find. The double room was large and clean and the bed comfortable while the staff was extremely helpful. But the relatively low cost isn't the main reason to choose this hotel. The main reason is that it's around the corner from Pikes Market, a block and a half away from the monorail and a 15 minute walk down to Pioneer Park. That's all we had the time to explore in the day we spent in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3781763">The Moore was exactly what we were looking for--low cost but right in downtown Seattle. The across the street parking lot was expensive--about $18/day--but even when you combine the parking with what we paid for our room, it's still less than any other hotel downtown. From where we were we walked everywhere, even to a Mariner's game. The room was clean and small to medium size. Our room had a view of the public market and the Puget Sound. For some reason half the channels on the TV didn't come in very well. I liked the character of an older hotel. We chose the "bathroom down the hall" option and we never had a problem having to wait to get into the shower, etc. If you are looking for luxury, it's not for you. But if you are looking for a reasonable price combined with the perfect location, the Moore is the best you'll find.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3744928">I consider the Moore Hotel a good deal for downtown Seattle. The location is very close to the harbour and the piers. Although the neighbourhood is not the best, I never felt unsafe. The room was clean enough but the lamp did not have a lamp shade. The closet smelled of moth balls or disinfectant. Unfortunately, I had to change rooms after two days although I made my reservation a long time in advance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3737974">I stayed here last month and was terribly disappointed. After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price. I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle. However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap. First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle. There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider "bad", and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town. Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room. After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!! I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies. I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep. Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking. I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking, but the Moore had nothing. I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day. My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place! Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3629493">After scouring the web for an inexpensive hotel in downtown Seattle, I came across the Moore Hotel on tripadvisor. I was surprised by all of the positive reviews it had, because I hadn't come across it on expedia, orbitz, etc. I was a little skeptical but stayed there for 3 nights in June. After my experience staying at the Moore, I felt that I definitely had to post a review. For anyone who's a little weary about how reliable on-line reviews are, the Moore Hotel will not disappoint. My room was huge, clean, and as a single female traveler, I felt completely safe. The location is unbeatable--just 2 short blocks from Pike Place Market. And I still can't believe how inexpensive it was. Awesome hotel. Would definitely stay there again if I ever go back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3621867">Went to Seattle for business in June and in an attempt to save the company some money I booked a room at the Moore. All the reviews I had read about the hotel were right-on. It is CLEAN, safe, old, and an incredible price. Every employee was exceptional and friendly. I was a little intimidated by the location at first, but after getting familar with the area, found it to be very convenient and safe. I will stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3558357">The Moore must be the best kept secret in Seattle. I researched downtown hotels extensively online and booked a room here for a weekend trip. I got a nice little room with a claw foot bath tub for $70 a night. The staff was very nice and accomodating. I used the internet in the lobby to check my flight times. The bar seemed a little daunting to a solo female traveler but there were many other options close by. Got an early check in which was awesome. Can't wait to come back.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3533139">After doing a little research looking for a 2 bedroom for 4 adults, I choose the Moore Hotel. I was given a rate of $135 a night (plus $10 for the extra 2) for a total of $150 a night. What we recived for our $150 a night was the biggest 3 bedroom you've ever seen! The 1st room had a full size bed, the 2nd room had 2 twin size beds, and the 3rd room had a queen. Each of the 3 rooms had a sink, and we did have to share a bathroom. Yes, we had no air conditioning, but we got 2 fans from the front desk, and left our windows (that open completly) cracked to get a nice cool breeze. I was worried at first when we arrived, as the lobby was very old and had not been updated in a long time, and there were a few "characters" hanging out right outside the entrance. However, the desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and assured us not to worry about the people outside. We took the (tiny) elevator to our room, where we were very impressed with the cleaning job and the size of the room. Being on the 4th floor, we wern't blessed with the greatest view in the world, but that was just fine. Yes the parking situation -----, but there are plenty of lots across the street, and if you park at night on the street, it is free, and very safe. Check out the Night Lite lounge next door for the best cheap strong drinks in the city. A funky little dive, where we were made to feel right at home.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3515041">After an exhaustive online search, I booked the Moore Hotel from May 22-24, 2005, for my sister and I to take a short shopping/sightseeing trip to Seattle. After a beautiful 3-hour drive from Vancouver, Canada, we arrived (late check-in; no problem) to be greeted by the "cool" front-desk clerk, who was more than accomodating. Our room, on the 6th floor with a lovely view of the Sound, was large and comfortable, with an impeccably clean bathroom complete with creatively-folded towels, just like in the Caribbean! For $69 a night, I couldn't imagine a better value in a major city, especially given the location, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, amazing shopping and great Belltown restaurants. Don't forget to ask the front-desk staff about parking. We were directed to a parkade across the street for $15/24 hours. Every city should have a Moore Hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3425880">I believe the Moore is the best budget hotel I've ever stayed in. I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been, my room has been clean and pleasant, the staff are friendly and helpful, the beds are comfortable and the location cannot be beat. I always stay in the rooms with a shared bath and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition and I have never once had to wait for an occupied bathroom. The hotel is located in Belltown where there are great restaurants, music clubs and bars everywhere. It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum. It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city. Just remember: the Moore is a budget hotel. You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it. The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive. But for $60/night in downtown Seattle you can't expect luxury. What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3398168">Historic Hotel just blocks from Pikes Market. The hotel offers very clean rooms, each with a sink, as well as a telephone, cable TV, Comfortable Queen size bed, several lamps, night stand, desk and several chairs. The room I had was very large and clean. The room's outside wall was all large windows with a great view of the Sound. I chose a room with a shared bath. I found the bathrooms down the hall were always kept clean, and I never had to wait to use one. The maids fold the towels and wash cloths into animal designs, such as a swan, which offers a nice welcoming touch to the room. Overall, I found the staff to be very friendly, and the location was tops. Only drawback if you are visiting in the middle of the summer is that they do not have air-conditioning. For the price you can't go wrong. They do not have parking, which you really don't need, as the downtown busses are free from 6:00am to 7:00pm (provided that you stay within the free bus zone). If you do need parking, there is a parking lot just across the street. Right next door to the Hotel is "The Moore Theater". It is the oldest theater in Seattle, and is still in operation.

<comment category="positive" id="UR3372138">If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the action and will have some money left over for fun, this is the place. Service was great, from booking to checking in etc. Very friendly staff. The room, which was a suite on the 7th floor, was fantastic! Okay sure the towels were a bit wimpy, but the arrangements they were put in daily was terrific. The view was great, fun to watch the ferries and cargo ships go by. We ended up just leaving our car on the street overnight. It was intact every morning. A great bargain, don't make the mistake of staying somewhere else to save a few dollars. Granted it is not new, but it does have old charm and they have done a lot to spice it up. Thumbs up Moore hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3321213">What a great find and what a great price! Thank you TripAdvisor! I stayed at the Moore for two nights before moving to the Grand Hyatt for a conference I had to attend. In my humble opinion, the Moore's location was infinitely better than the Hyatt's. Although it's 100 years old, the Moore glows - the restoration was done well and the rooms are quite comfortable. Downtown Seattle, in all its splendor, is just a couple of short blocks away. The restaurants and nightlife of Belltown are right there too. I loved having Starbucks on the next block for my morning coffee, and Pike Place is just a few blocks away for breakfast The young man who worked at the front desk each evening was also fascinating to talk to. I can't wait for my next visit. The Moore is a jewel!<topic>none</topic>

I stay here when attending tradeshows or rock shows. Price range is from $39 - $129 depending on whether you want dorm style shared bathroom/private room or all the way up to a multi-room suite. Very clean, would stay here again. Close to great restaurants, Belltown, shopping. Can't say enough good things about this place.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3309093">If you are on a tight budget and don't feel like spending much time in your room---this is the place. The rooms are very dated and sparce with thin towels and no ameneties(blow dryers-shampoo-irons) All of the linens, however, were very clean. When I plugged in my blowdryer in the morning---the lights dimmed from the power drain...the windows were very thin and you can hear the sirens going down 2nd and Virginia through the night..Luky for me---my visit to the Liquid lounge by the Space Neddle provided me with a little extra sleeping power. The location can not be beat---Walk to Pikes and the waterfront as well as the mall and the Monorail. The Rail stops at 7pm and the taxi ride back from the Space Needle was only $4.50 exc. tip. The front desk was very friendly----What the Moore lacks in sparkle--it makes up for in service. If old means "charming"and peeling paint means "vintage"---you will like the Moore---The price and location can not be beat---just don't expect a mint on your pillow :)<topic>none</topic>

Staff are very helpful, rooms are very clean and the hotel itself is charming and interesting. Very close to Downtown Seattle, bus lines, the ferries and only a few short blocks north of Pike Place Market. If you are looking for plush towels and jacuzzi's, stay elsewhere. If you are looking for historical ambience, a staff that cares and to save yourself some money, the Moore cannot be beat.

<comment category="negative" id="UR3222620">Had two seperate stays at The Moore. First room was on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the Puget Sound. The room had updated furniture, bathroom fixtures and possibly new carpet. I was pleasantly surprised. I was prepared for the small and thin towels. The water pressure wasn't good and I am not that finicky. Second room had bad water pressure as well. There was music at the Theatre one night, but at least it was soothing to fall asleep too. Can't say enough about the helpful and knowledgable staff. Kudos! GREAT LOCATION!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2905146">I stayed at the Moore Hotel on Dec 3rd, 4th and 5th, 2004 and I have to say the Moore Hotel had it's positives and some negatives. If you are a tourist and want to check out some of Seattle's downtown famous attractions like The Space Needle, Pike's Place Market and Pioneer Square then the Moore is a great hotel to stay in because you can walk to all three of these locations from the hotel. The Moore Hotel has clean rooms, they are kind of old, but it's a clean place to sleep and shower. The staff are very friendly, but the only bad side is, you won't get the nice bathroom amneties in a Holiday Inn or a Hilton. The Moore Hotel's bathrooms are small (they are clean) but small, the towels are very thin and not full bath size, so bring your own. Other than that, it's a nice place to sleep and stay for a short period of time. We had a room facing Elliot's Bay, and it was a beautiful view. There is a large mall about 3 blocks from the hotel. Pike's Place market is 2 blocks from the Moore Hotel, the space needle is about 8 blocks away, and you can catch the free city bus to Pioneer Square if you don't feel like walking 10 blocks. Basically, the Moore Hotel is a clean place to sleep at night, it's clean and the rates are very reasonable for a hotel in downtown Seattle. I'd stay there again, for a short time. If you are arriving in Seattle from Sea-Tac International Airport, use the transportation company 'Shuttle Express', they have vans that take you from the airport to the hotel for about $20 bucks...they are efficient, on-time, friendly, and affordable...they dropped us off and picked us up from the Moore Hotel perfectly.<topic>none</topic>

Two blocks from Pike Place for less than $70 before taxes is tough to beat. A clean room with a partial view of the sound adds to the value.

<comment category="positive" id="UR123871805">I must admit that our 2-night stay at Miauw was unplanned. A little back story: My husband and I arrived in Amsterdam on New Year's Day, 2012 and discovered that the "highly rated" B&amp;B we had booked two months prior was a complete and utter disaster. (long story, different review) After enduring one very dreadful night, I remembered that we had brought along an older (July, 2007) New York Times article of "36-hours in Amsterdam". Miauw was one of the suggested places to stay, so I immediately called and reached Analik. THANKFULLY, some guests had just checked out and Analik invited us to come on over - even though it was barely mid-morning and not even close to check-in time. Analik greeted us warmly when we arrived and took us up the two flights of stairs to view the apartment, which was still being cleaned after the previous guests. Even in an untidy state (seriously, how can people be such slobs?) we could see that the space was fantastic! At this point we realized how hungry we were and asked Analik for a coffee/breakfast recommendation. She suggested Screaming Beans, which was just around the corner. Great choice - good food and excellent coffee. Returning to the suite an hour or two later, it was as if we had walked in to a magazine spread! I won't repeat everything that other reviewers have rightly mentioned about how comfortable and well-appointed the space is, but I do wish to highlight a few things that made the White Suite so special: 1) The fantastic views from the windows - day or night. 2) Heated floors - these were absolutely wonderful to come back to after walking about in the cold and rain, and helped make the apartment incredibly cozy. 3) Location - so, so close to wonderful restaurants, bars, and excellent shopping ranging from unique boutiques to vintage. 4) Analik - even though we had just two days to experience Amsterdam, she listened to us when we described our interests and offered spot-on tips and suggestions. Like others, we were sad to leave Miauw Suites and Amsterdam - but we do hope to return one day.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122358509">Miauw is one of the most beautiful holiday experiences we have ever had. Every detail has been thought of in the rooms. We stayed in the White Suite and loved the design, the views and the location. Super comfortable king size bed bed, spacious gorgeous living room with gorgeous big windows and views of the Keizersgracht, and a full working kitchen with a table big enough for us to host a small, home cooked dinner party for 5 of our local friends on the last night. The White Suite was always impecaably clean, and also has great details like a Bang &amp; Olufsen TV, and lovely Ren bath products. We stayed just before Chistmas and the room temperature was always perfect, heat easily and quickly adjusted. There is an Albert Heijn (supermarket) literally 3 mins away, a great coffee bar just next door (Screaming Beans) and so many wonderful restaurants and bars to choose from. Analik is thoughtful enough to leave a few essentials in the kitchen like tea, sugar, olive oil etc so that you dont need to buy these things if, like us, you take full advantage of being able to cook your own meals in the gorgeous smeg kitchen! Maybe I am biased or somehow understood this immeditately beacuse I am Dutch, and originally from Amsterdam and know the area well -but I honestly I don't know how anyone could have gone to their website and thought that they were getting a full service hotel experience, they make it pretty clear that you are getting a very exclusive apartment! As far as other comments about showers being small and stairs being steep- you're in the Netherlands! Stay at home or in a big chain hotel if you don't want to experience or cant handle the quirks that make Amsterdam so special and quaint as a city (tall and not very wide houses!) My husband and I will only stay here from now on when we come visit and honestly cannot wait to return!<topic>none</topic>

The nine streets area is probably the most unique Dutch experience you will have anywhere in Amsterdam, minus the Wind Mill... It truely feels like a village.

<comment category="positive" id="UR120562434">Letâ€™s get one thing straight â€“ Miauw Suites is not a hotel â€“ there is no concierge or room service and if you need a full service hotel, then donâ€™t stay here. However, if youâ€™re looking for a very central, stylish apartment as a base for a city break, then Iâ€™d thoroughly recommend it. The rooms are a little noisy as they overlook a canal street, but the views of the Amsterdam canals are stunning and the interiors very chic and minimalist. I especially liked the wet room bathrooms â€“ small but practical. Would definitely stay again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118758250">Miauw Suites looked great on the internet but the reality is completely different. This is not actually a hotel as it has no facilities outside of the rooms whatsoever. Having lugged our bags up the steep stairs to the first floor (no elevator) we arrived in the White Room. The temperature was around 90 degrees inside (despite being 70 outside) and there is no air conditioning. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to experience a boutique hotel but this was appalling in every way. We checked out straight away and found alternative accommodation close by that was very good. Miauw Suites has declined to refund any of our costs for the 2 night stay. I understand that we arrived at 3pm on the first day and that it would be unlikely that the room could be sold again but feel that the second night should have been refunded.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117879342">The TRIPADVISOR reviews were so glowing that I chose Miauw Suites over many other possibilities. Supposedly my husband and I had been upgraded from a room to a suite, but the space didn't seem to be a suite by what I consider a suite. The bed was very comfortable; the room was clean; the young woman Maya who showed us to our room was very helpful and nice; the building was on a canal. But the room/suite was probably not worth the price we paid. Given that there is no lobby or concierge service, we walked a block to the Hotel Pulitzer and used their concierge services. They were very helpful in arranging a day tour to Rotterdam, Madurodam, Delft, a flower market, etc. They also got us taxis once or twice. Several days after we returned home, I read an article in the New York Times about people getting paid $5 to write positive reviews about hotels or restaurants. I was sad to read that the authenticity of some of the TRIPADVISOR reviews might be compromised.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR107575563">I rarely write travel reviews but with our stay at Miauw, I just have to. First off, it's not your typical hotel but that's the reason why we chose this. Secondly, location is fantastic. Third, the rooms are spotless, greatly designed and furnished and well-maintained. Like what others have said, dreamy and airy, bathe in white and subtle colors, with fresh flowers during our entire stay. We stayed for 4 nights. Two nights at the White Room, 2 nights at the White Suite. The suite is like having your own apartment in AMS, complete with a functioning kitchen, dining and living area, and a serapate bedroom.

<comment category="positive" id="UR106568726">Miauw Suites was a highlight of my stay. I love design hotels and this one fit the bill, but was even more intimate, because it's almost like staying in your hip, stylish friend's spare room versus a veritable hotel. The room was a modern design lover's dream: charcoal walls, crisp white bedding that's just as comfortable as a Westin bed, an Apple computer in the room, fresh flowers and a view that is postcard-perfect. I would love to stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR84855125">I have been to Amsterdam numerous times over the past 6 years, and the western canal belt / night streets area is my favorite area of the city. Beautiful canals, nice boutiques, cafes, higher quality restaurants, etc. Miauw Suites is a unique property with 4 rooms of different design. I stayed 2 nights in the souterrain suite, and 1 night in the white room. The souterrain suite is a good choice if you want your own kitchen, and separate living space. The white room, despite being smaller, was somehow even more charming with the high windows and canal view. You get a little more street noise in the white room, but I am sensitive to noise, and it did not bother me. I slept great in both, and I would stay in either room again. If you want to feel like you have your own apartment in what I consider to be the best area of the city for walking along the canals, this is a great option. In this area of the city I have also stayed in hotel ambassade, and hotel estherea. My personal preference is Miauw out of those three choices, but Ambassade is also a good property. Miauw is a good choice for couples who want some privacy and do not need a concierge service.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR78171786">We stayed with my partner for 4 nights at Miauw, one night at the white room and the rest in the black room. In my opinion the place is one of the most stylish in Amsterdam, and one of the most stylish I have ever stayed in. Elegant, understated, a kind of 17th century Amsterdam meeting today's city (one of the main capitals of European design). Ok, I will grant you that the baths were a tad small (and frankly a bit weird) and there was no closet in the white room. But both rooms were truly a unique experience. We felt like we were staying in our own place or as guests to a friend's house, not in a hotel. And the location was simply fabulous. Martha, the girl taking care of the rooms and checking us in/out, was so kind and smiley and helpful, it really made our trip even better. We will definitely return!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR64285502">We stayed here for 3 nights in April. This is an amazing find and in one of the best locations in Amsterdam. It is very close to the Nine Streets, which provides some of the most charming eating, shopping and walking in Amsterdam. We stayed in the White room, which provided a large and very comfortable bed. The bathroom is a little unique, but it works. The room has large windows facing the canal. The room is also equipped with a Mac for your use. There is no breakfast included but because of the location, you would want to go out and have breakfast in one of the cafe's that offer a great Dutch pancake! You may want to make sure that you bring your own soap and shampoo.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR28760951">We spent three nights in a wonder suite which was basically a one bedroom designer apartment . We usually stay at the Amstel or the Grand and this was very special as well. Of course you don't have all the help of a fine hotel but the location is top notch and you really experience the best of Amsterdam. I loved the 9 streets area which surrounds the apartment. I would go for the larger suite which is the whole floor of two attached town houses. The bathroom is smallish but really there are so many pluses like the all white interior and cool furniture and lamps; it all looks like an apartment you find in designer magazines. The kitchen was amazing and very elegant and cool. Also included is a Mac and internet which makes everything so much easier. Also I should mention you will have to tackle very steep stairs with your luggage so keep this in mind before booking. We would be definitely staying again. Our friends were staying nearby and they were very impressed by the place and the price. Really really nice!, I highly recommendy the Miauw Suites for a fantastic and classy experience of the best of Amsterdam.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR27359786">We stayed here for one night due to a late flight arrival time, and had a great stay - short, but great. The location is super easy to get to by tram from the main train station. Check in was easy as well - I sms'd my contact at the hotel when we were leaving the airport, and she was there when we arrived. The room was amazing - it was quite spacious, and the decor was french toile with a great chandelier. The bathroom was small, but very functional. Apple computer with tv and radio functions, plus some movies and cds available for your use. Coffee machine in the shop downstairs is available for use as well. All in all, no complaints. If you're looking for a 24 hour concierge, room service offering type of place then this isn't for you, but if you're more independent and looking for a comfy bed in a greal location, then this is a good option for you!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR26267661">I have been traveling all throughout Europe staying in moderately priced hotels, and this is by far my favorite. Whitewashed rooms, large and luxurious beds, everything done tastefully and as simply as possible. Great locations. Tiny bathrooms, but much nicer than anywhere else I've stayed. It's not a room service/concierge kind of place, it's really just a comfortable place to stay. But it was everything I needed. Highly recommend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24761270">Great room (white double) in a fab location with stunning views of the canal. Bright and airy with a small, functional wetroom (some may find it cramped). The lack of soft furnishings in the spacious room made it more difficult to enjoy the view but we managed ! The bed was very comfortable and you could enjoy the views without getting out of it ! The location was fabulous, near to everything, great part of town. Access to a communal area with fridge and expresso machine (fab coffee available for guest use) was great. Apple computer in the room with WIFI and movies, music, etc. Booking the room was a bit of a chore but that may have been due to the fact that the owners were abroad.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR126442278">I was a little underwhelmed with this hotel. The price was good, though, so I wasn't expecting the world. I had read reviews saying the hotel was run down. It isn't. It's an older property so isn't brand-spankin' new, but it is certainly not run-down. We stayed in a basic room. It was a basic room. Standard layout. Small bathroom. Excellent bed. The lobby is unimpressive. There are no restaurants in the hotel except a coffee shop. However, there is a great italian place just up the street with the best tiramisu. The staff were very friendly. We came with two dogs, so we're not the most desirable clientele, but the staff were all very accommodating. All-in-all, there was nothing really wrong with this place but I don't think I would stay here again. It was just very average.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR125664131">This was the first hotel we stayed on our westcoast trip and we stayed here for two nights. We already booked this hotel at home, especially because of the good reviews of other visitors regarding the great location. It was easy to reach from Seattle-Tacoma airport, a disadvantage is that there is no free parking available, we had to use the parking garage next to the hotel, which costs about 23$/day. The location is really excellent, many sights are in walking distance to the hotel (e.g. Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and Space Needle, waterfront, ...). Our room was nice, clean and had the perfect size. Only the bathroom was a little bit too small, but still okay. The only thing about this hotel which was not acceptable was this terrible smell in the corridor and even worse in the room! Due to the fact that we couldn't open the window entirely, there was no chance to get rid off this disgusting smell. However, after 5 minutes in the room we got used to it. In our opinion the room rate is too high (despite the great location) and therefore we would consider to look for another accomodation in this area for our next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR125291091">this is a value priced hotel, and there are some inconveniences. however, some are to be expected when staying downtown in an older hotel in a large city. parking is around the corner, and will only allow for a normal height SUV at most. there are some stairs in both the parking structure and hotel before you get to the elevator, inconvenient when you have large bags. the rooms, albeit very small, have most of the modern conveniences. the air circulation, heating, cooling are not the best. the brite side is that the staff is wonderful, and the location is convenient to walk to the best shopping and embibing the city has to offer.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124931970">We are frequent visitors to Seattle from Vancouver Canada. Take the train down, relax and walk about 15 minutes to this refurbished hotel. It isn't five star but it is good value and great location. Rooms: clean and neat. Bathroom: smallish but very well appointed. Location: excellent access to SAM and a few blocks to Pike Place (but transit in Seattle downtown is free, so don't take the car and pay for unnecessary silly parking). Staff: helpful and professional. Shout out to the doormen/bellmen: great guys who hustle those cabs late at night. Stop whining about "it isn't big enough" "we have to walk uphill": Hotel has all the amenities of a more luxurious stay: robes, hair dryer, coffee maker and upscale toiletries. Seattle is a get what you pay for place as most are and this is my best choice for a budget conscious weekend get away. Save a few bucks and go out for a great meal. Only downside was a slightly noisy heating system- but you can get over that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124479181">I was looking for a better than average Hotel downtown for my wife and I to enjoy a valentine weekend and I thought the price offered was the best deal. We only stayed one night in #423. Well, you get what you pay for. The location is good for being downtown, but you still have the street people present around the area enough to make you feel uncomfortable. If you are looking for roomy rooms, well donâ€™t come here. The rooms are nice, but very small. If you are a taller or a larger person the bathrooms within the room are not for you. The door and the wall are about 5-6 inches to the toilet (no leg room to sit properly). The only roomy thing in the bathroom is the tub and even that is only 5ft long. The cleanliness in the room was bad. The bathroom glass door was dirty with hand prints. The bedding looked like they changed the sheets and the pillow cases, but kept the down comforter from the previous tenant. The bed is hard and the walls to your neighbor are very thin. I could have had a decent conversation with my neighbor and understand what they were saying. Plus, the self parking is "steep" in my opinion at $21.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124281133">We traveled from Vancouver to Seattle and stayed only one night at the hotel. The location was perfect for our purpose: have a night out in downtown and attending a preview at the Seattle Art Museum the next morning. The Executive has an agreement with a parking next door and we payed $23 for a 24-hour parking period. Our room faced the Seattle Library. Noise from the street wasn't much of a problem, but I could hear other guests using their showers through the pipes. In the morning, I could hear people talking on the hallway and doors being slammed. Small room ,very small bathroom (no bath tub), but we didn't need anything more than what was being offered. There is a coffeemaker in the room and a Seattle's best Coffee at the lobby. When we visited, they were offering a 'wine reception' at the mezzanine â€“ that meant having a glass of wine before leaving for dinner. Nice! I would stay here again whenever I need a central place, but it's not exactly the kind of hotel I would recommend to friends, unless they are looking for a great rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR123851457">This hotel is in a older building across the street from the Seattle Public Library. There is a Seattle's Best Coffee shop inside the hotel which is great. The staff are pleasant and very helpful. Unfortunately that isn't the issue. We stayed here Saturday night in a Queen Room. The walls are so think I could hear someone next door coughing every 2-3 minutes. Then the person on the other side of us came in from a night on the town very loud and drunk. Coughing on one side, talking on the other..needless to say we couldn't get to sleep. In fairness, I don't think the people talking were talking that loud but it was still very annoying. We called the front desk and they graciously moved us to another room at 1 a.m. This room was a King and much nicer than the queen. I would only stay here again if I had a King room and asked for a corner unit. The decor has been updated but you can see that they only upgraded the essentials. The bathroom in the Queen was small and cramped.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR123271408">So I stayed here alone for two nights. Staff was extremely friendly - great with recommendations. They allowed me to check in to my room several hours earlier than check in. The hotel is your typical downtown hotel in a historic building. In other words, pretty small (I had the basic queen room) but it should be enough for two people. Very clean, comfortable bedding. Location: although I thought Downtown Seattle had a surprisingly big city feel to it (it is very built up, great urban planning, great density in buildings) in reality, it isn't that big. That being said, all it means is that this hotel is very central and very walkable to all of the main attractions. One other thing, as mentioned by someone prior to me, the 5-6pm wine hour is really great. Free booze and you get to meet other people! And to the staff member who was planning to move to San Diego, I almost made it all the way to the airport on foot. Well not almost, I walked about 4 miles but the the area started to get a little shifty looking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122796541">First of all let me say that we had a Groupon so our rate was lower....I am so glad I didn't pay the full room rate. If Groupons are being offered to introduce the property for recommendations or return visits, they lost this recommendation and I won't be returning. So we had a Deluxe King....small room, small bathroom, itty bitty sink and I couldn't dry my hair without the power going out! I was even using the hairdryer provided in the room! One robe in the closet that was ...well I guess it was a robe. We were supposed to get wine and Sees candies in the room. My husband called down about the wine and about 15 minutes later this guy knocks on the door and says "Here." passing a bottle of $6.99 wine (the wine was supposed to be a $30 value) and a box of Russell Stover candy. After the delivery, we discovered there was not a corkscrew in the room. My husband called down about this and they said that they don't have corkscrews in the rooms, but there is one at the front desk. No offer to come up and open our wine...guess we were supposed to go down ourselves to open it. We decided to save it and bring it home....FAIL! All in all...ok..pretty clean, not what we expected. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to be in center of things downtown which the location of this hotel is excellent for that. Service not so great on many occasions but I don't have all night to go into it. It's too bad. But because it was our anniversary we did enjoy ourselves and it didn't spoil our fun BUT we won't be back again.<topic>none</topic>

Also the lobby and other street level access is not wheelchair accessible from the elevator. The elevator opens on its own level and you have to walk up or down stairs to get out of the hotel. Strange set up. It was difficult getting a cab from in front of the hotel. It seemed a little expensive for the odler style rooms and building. One good note-it is attached to a Seattle's Best Coffee and across the street from a great Italian restaurant.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR122227693">The details of the rooms detailed on their website are falsely listed. They do not offer continental breakfast, they do not have a fridge in the room. Booking travel comes with expectations based on the outline of hotel and room rate details. This hotel misrepresents what is offered. The rooms are very small but that is the expectation for a downtown hotel of this era. The bed was small and rather hard, pillows also flat. Bathroom ammenities were minimal and the sink very small. The location was very close to the stadiums but quite a distance from the markets on the waterfront. Reasonable for a reduced rate. Elevator slow and very old.<topic>none</topic>

The morning staff was also very pleasant. I particularly liked the bellhops, very very nice people. The room was pretty small (think European-sized bathroom), but for the price (compared to other hotels within a few blocks of this location) it has everything you need. If you just need overnight accommodation in downtown Seattle, this is a perfect place to be. Walking distance to Pike Place Market and Convention Center. If you are staying for a lengthy period, maybe pay more for a larger space, but this was exactly what I needed when I needed it.<topic>none</topic>

Rooms aren't big, but for the price, all we needed was two beds, a nice tv and a bathroom. AC didn't work all the time so we had to sleep with the window open, which was not a huge issue.

The bed was super comfy. The hotel was in the heart of downtown Seattle and was walking distance to a lot of shopping and attractions. Overall it was nice but needs some upgrades.

<comment category="negative" id="UR121499472">Pictures are deceiving. Rooms were small. My son paid extra for a room with a city view and we received a room with a view of the parking garage. Please don't pay extra - its just one way they will screw you out of more money. The room had no a/c, only heat. The room was EXTREMELY stuffy and hot. They did give us a fan which helped just a bit and was told to open the window. Yeah right - couldn't open the window. It was cooler in the hall than the room. I cannot tolerate a warm or hot area. It was difficult to sleep - bed was small and uncomfortable along with having no air circulation. Bathroom was really, really small. Very disappointed. No continental breakfast although there is a coffee shop attached to the hotel. When we checked out, my son expressed his dislike and concerns and the girl on duty said that she would have the manager call my son. My son asked if she had his number and she stated "yes" and we knew she didn't because he booked through Expedia and the person on duty did not ask for a phone number when we checked in, so we knew she was lying. My son asked her what number she had and of course she couldn't say because (A) she really didn't care, (B) she had no plans of telling the manager and (C) She was lying. Customer service was definitely lacking at this location. Although it was in a great area, it lacked EVERYTHING else. Would NOT reccomend this place at all.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR121304300">We stayed at this hotel Nov 25-29th, and this is our 3rd time staying here. This is a great hotel because not only does it have an awesome location in the downtown area of Seattle, but it also has a coffee shop basically in the hotel, and the coffee is great. Plus if you don't like that coffee shop...just walk down the street about a block and there is a Starbucks! One thing we love about this hotel is the fact that you can pretty much walk anywhere from this hotel, no need for taxi rides! We had reserved online with the advance purchase and got 20% off plus when we arrived and asked if it was possible to get an upgrade to a king size room, it was free! The bed was very comfy, the tv was good, alittle small, but it had cable tv, the room itself was clean and had everything we needed...one thing that would good in the rooms would be a mini fridge for drinks. The bathroom is nice, it was a little small, but it was clean &amp; have everthing we needed. A couple bonuses that we liked was a safe in the room as well as free wi-fi in our room! One thing to be aware of (we were not) is that you will be charged for all local calls. We did not know this, and when we got a bill at the end of our stay, I did dispute the charges because for one thing we were not told about this and also many of the calls we made had not been answered, so we felt we should not be charged. The Manager was great, and did discount the charge by half, which was good, but just beware...don't make any local calls at the hotel! Our room faced Spring Street and could be alittle noisy at night, but its the city, and most hotel rooms are noisy in the city.

<comment category="negative" id="UR121004195">The name and exterior entrance is evocative of a slightly more luxurious experience than whatâ€™s in store for you. Although their user fees, like $0.75 per local phone call, seem to adhere to a luxury tier. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the place is clean and nice, has some vending machines on the mezzanine ($2 for a can of pop), and nice TVs in the room but the place was built in 1938 and it shows in some places. Sometimes charming like the tiling in the bathroom and the cast iron tub but other times downright irritating like the radiator that you canâ€™t turn off that constantly makes noise (it wasnâ€™t until I managed to force open the nearly-painted-shut window that I was finally able to get some sleep) or the bathtub not draining properly (I got a shower, my feet and ankles got a bath). The electrical outlet sparked at me more than once as I was plugging things in â€“ not only a fire and safety hazard but dangerous for your electronics. The staff are fantastic, check in is a breeze. When you check out thereâ€™s just a guy standing in the lobby â€“ no uniform, no nametag but very polite, helpful, and nicely dressed (in a sweater, not a suit), but part of me canâ€™t help but wonder how hard it would be for some grifter to just stand there and con people out of luggage, fees, credit cards, or whatever. If youâ€™re going from the train station the walk from the station is a killer as it is uphill the entire way at a significant incline. The toiletries that are supplied are nice, organic, and effective. Overall Iâ€™m not sure that this place is your best option in Seattle â€“ if youâ€™re driving there are much better and cheaper options further out from the downtown core and if youâ€™re not you may want to consider staying at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle. In the end a hotel is a place to sleep and that radiator problem makes that problematic at best so while this property has some nice touches it unfortunately fails in a fundamental way. Exceptional service canâ€™t make up for a bad nightâ€™s sleep.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120886317">So, let's start from the pros: This is place is in a good position, has a parking on the next door building (you have to pay extra, of course) and is below the average cost for a hotel in the city centre of Seattle. Let's go to the cons: Elevator was working intermittently, it happened that we sometimes had to wait for 20 min before we could use it, and once we used the stairs instead (bear in mind that we were on 7th floor). All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys. Going to the rooms: our was small, not so clean, and the bathroom was microscopic, too. We could barely fit our suitcases on the floor. We could hear noise coming both from the corridor, and from the neighboring room, which was pretty annoying especially late at night. It is true that we did not spend much on this stay, but next time I would rather pay 100$/night more rather than staying at this place again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120468515">The hotel is located in the heart of downtown. If you are arriving by car, you should expect steep hills, lots of one-way streets, a lack of on street parking and (of course) traffic in Downtown Seattle. Taxi would eliminate all of those issues. I had some challenges finding it, but that was probably more about me &amp; driving in downtown Seattle. As others have said â€“ the room was small. I found it to be plenty big enough for my purpose. See the photos. The bed was comfortable â€“ and the covers were warm enough even though very thin and light. Thatâ€™s saying something â€“ I tend to be cold at night. The closet it large and has a door. That is one of those little things that I really like. I donâ€™t like looking at a bunch of clothes hanging in the open closets. It also comes with a safe that was easy to operate. It was really nice to be able to lock up laptop when I was away from the room. Across from the closet is the tiny, tiny bathroom (see picture). I am not usually claustrophobic, but it is so small I did not feel comfortable with the door closed. The tub is another matter. I could not decide if the tub was just old and looked tired, or if it needed a good cleaning. Fortunately, my stay was brief enough I never had to actually use it. Look at the picture and decide for yourself. Expect a few quirks just from being it being an old building â€“ Example: the window did not seat 100% allowing some fresh air and a bit of street noise. Nothing that bothered me, but I overheard others complaining about it. Part of being an old building also means it is not good for those with mobility issues. You must go up or down about 7-10 steps to get to/from the elevator. Most people without limitations wonâ€™t be bothered by it. In the afternoon there is a complementary wine bar. That alone is a nice touch, but I was impressed as the manager is there and greets his guests personally and inquires as to how you are enjoying your stay â€“ and he actually wants to know! Too many managers lock themselves away in an office somewhere. There is a coffee place off the lobby â€“ a separate business, but connected so you can get your morning coffee/bagel without going out in Seattleâ€™s weather. Around the corner (same building) is Jasmine: It felt like a bar and had really good Asian foodâ€¦.but thatâ€™s another review. The Good: * Staff â€“ friendly, helpful * Manager â€“ goes out of his way to make sure his guests are happy (staff too) * Location â€“ Middle of downtown * Old building â€“ charm, details * Free wine social hour â€“ a great way to have a glass or two and unwind after a day of meetings while we decide how to spend the evening. The Bad: * Location â€“ too far (walking) from the main restaurant area, or waterfront. * Old building â€“ not accessible, showing its age * Questionable cleaning? Bottom line â€“ To be honest, I had mixed feelings about my stay - Iâ€™m still not sure if I would stay there again<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120157674">The Hotel was in a great location for walking to many attractions in downtown Seattle. We arrived on the train and didn't rent a car but we were able to walk to the hotel within 10 minutes and walked everywhere from the football stadium to the Space Needle comfortably and with no problems. The rooms were basic but clean, the staff was nice and, even though there were in the middle of remodeling and construction, everything operated pretty efficiently.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119919838">Was ambivalent to stay after reading some reviews but we found it a great hotel at a great price in a great location. Don't expect a homogenous chain experience here. Refreshingly unique. We easily got a street facing room, had no noise problems and found no problem with the bathroom! The wine reception was delightful! The staff was very attentive and friendly. Would definitely stay here again! You can't beat the rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119903643">This small hotel is at the corner of 4th and Spring, which is a very convenient location for all of the main downtown Seattle things to do, like Pike Place, the Public Library, Smith Tower, Bank of America Tower, nice restaurants, the SAM, the Symphony, shopping, etc. We almost didn't need a car except that we wanted to go around the Olympic Peninsula. The rooms are a little small, but still comfortable, and clean, and the price was very respectable. The customer service was great at the front desk, the valet, and the ladies who cleaned the rooms (we always left the room a little disheveled, and returned to a spic and span room). I booked the room and then later called and asked if it had a tub, to which I was answered with a yes. Turns out, they hadn't actually checked or something because we checked into a room without a bathtub, but when we called down and mentioned our problem, they immediately switched us to a room with a tub at no extra cost to us. I'd definitely stay here again based on the customer service and location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119759658">I was in town for the weekend on business and found the hotel to be a marginally average place to stay if you will not be spending a lot of time in the room. I reserved their "deluxe suite" which was quite small (I'd hate to see what the standard room looks like, probably a closet). It was only manageable for a single traveler. The bed was comfortable and the TV had a nice array of channels. The bathroom was quite small as well and not built for someone over 5ft6. You cannot close the door without lifting up your knees if you are on the commode. The tub appeared to be stained which wasn't very nice to look at but the shower was nice. I found the heat/ac unit to be rather old and clunky. You cannot do much to control either. There is just a fan option. When I arrived the room was super hot and stuffy. The window only opens 6 inches (to prevent people from jumping since the room is so hot I assume) so it took a while for the room to air out and cool down. The front desk staff seemed rather aloof and disinterested in their customers as well. Do not use the vending machines in the hotel, they charge $2.00 for a can of soda!! Instead, take a walk to the Bartels drugstore just a few blocks south of the hotel and purchase beverages and snacks. On the bright side, the fabulous Seattle Public Library is right next door and there is decent WiFi in the room. This hotel is best for those who do not plan on driving since parking is expensive and minimal. One guest was given the incorrect parking instructions and was told he had to pay $87 for parking since the staff told him the wrong complex so beware if you are parking there, make sure you are given directions to the absolute correct complex. Also, Spring Street is a pretty vertical hill so if you are walking there from a Light Rail terminal, stay on 4th or 5th Ave to avoid having to walk up that crazy hill with your luggage. Other than that, it was an okay stay. I would only recommend this hotel if you do not plan on spending much time in the room, aren't brining a car, aren't too picky about temperature, are a single traveler on a budget, or enjoy walking up hills.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119310656">This was our second time staying here, So I already knew the location was great and a good value. This time with our booking we had the hosted wine reception with our package, and it was amazing! The host Roberto was so welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable about the city. He even ran across the street and got a newspaper for us!!!!!! He went above and beyond, and the wine was great. Yes the rooms are a bit smaller but the bed was comfortable! The location is great, you can walk to everything! and there's some great restaurants nearby. When we checked out, the Valet literally ran to go get our car! We will definitely be staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119279864">Just spent 4 nites at this hotel and loved the location! Across the street from Seattle's beautiful public library and within a 10 min walk of Pike Place Market, this hotel is a great bet for the money. Just be sure to request a room that faces the street. We spent a stuffy first nite in an interior room that faced an algae-ridden AC unit on the back of the property. The room was tiny, hot, and had very little natural light. (No working AC.) l Needless-to-say, that was not okay. The next morning, I nicely asked the front desk folks to move us to a room with better circulation so we could stay cool and they put us in a spacious corner room at no extra cost. Just goes to show...it's always worth nicely asking for what you need.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119278720">Location is good and I wouldn't have minded the small rooms and older style building but my biggest complaint was the very thin walls. I find it so frustrating when hotels insist on putting all their guests together on one floor side by side when it's clearly a non busy time. Here's a thought spread out your guests so we don't have to hear each other flushing toilets at 5:30 am (especially if you install industrial toilets that you would find in a public washroom). I probably wouldn't return but if you are reading this for advice - ask for a quiet room away from other guests.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119207421">After reading the past reviews I was a little apprehensive on what to expect of this hotel... I booked a basic queen room through wotif.com for myself, partner and lil one, for just over $100 usd.. On arrival we asked for a free upgrade as we had heard that the rooms were on the smallish side, they obliged and gave us a king business room on the 7th floor. The room was good, big enough for us all and all of our luggage. The bed was super comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping at all... The bathroom was a tad small but it didn't really bother us too much!! The location is fantastic and you can walk to all the major attractions in the city - which was great for us as we only had a short time to see everything. The free drinks from 5-7pm was also a bonus!! I'd definitely stay here again if in seattle!! .<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119163380">I am an international traveller, with access to all types, sizes and brands of hotels worldwide. I love this hotel. The location is excellent, the staff friendly, cleanliness is exceptional and again, the location, location, location is the best ! This property if for the seasoned traveller, like me, who know the difference between a real city hotel, and a hotel in any city. This hotel represents the way Seattle is and was before all the large brand hotels rebuilt and knocked down the ones with character. It is not for the cheap, inexperienced traveller who does know know the difference between vintage and old.However, it is for those of us, who have the ability and knowledge to chose what we want, and where we want to stay. This hotel reminds me of the one I also perfer to stay in when in London England, The White House whose rooms are well appointed and smaller, because that is how they built them to attract the city dweller, not the inexperience traveller who does no the difference. If you want to experience the history and charm of Seattle this is the place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119056470">I am a college student, used to living in dorm rooms. I have never heard such intimate details of what people staying next to me were up to as I have at the Executive Hotel Pacific. The couple next to us obviously waited to initiate intimacy until after the six o'clock CBS news, both of which I could hear clearly. The woman next door had such loud yelps and gasps of pleasure I felt like I was in the wrong by just being in my room. By two am I had had enough and when my roommate and I called to the front desk to ask to switch rooms they put us right next to the elevator, which we could also hear extremely clearly every time it was used for the rest of the night. I would have rather stayed in my dorm which had as much free space and also never left me so certain anyone in the next room was "faking it."<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119040197">We arrived at the Executive Pacific Hotel a good three hours before our scheduled check in time but the receptionist was quite happy to allocate our room immediately, so we dumped our bags and headed straight back out to a Mariners ball game and didn't return till midnight. We therefore totally missed the complementary wine tasting offered in our deal and I forgot to enquire whether it was to be held. So, we basically used the room to sleep and for that it was ideal!!! 'Executive' to me conjures up an image of a business standard hotel that I would say the EP doesn't quite hit - the room wasn't massive, the window was broken and the bedlight was suspiciously intermittent. But for a one-night rate of Â£76 for a double room bang in the centre of town and two blocks from University station, I'd say it was a result!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118829444">This is an older property that has been rehabbed as space permitted. Rooms are tight but doable. The biggest problem for us was lack of handicap accessibility. The lower floor is actually 3 levels and one has a full fight of stairs to get to the elevators from the outside entrances.

<comment category="negative" id="UR118754506">Positives: Location is great, its close to the Pike market, shopping and food options. Staff was very friendly Negatives: This hotel is very old and you can see by the wooden window frames and building structure. Its been updated but its still nothing special. The elevator was a huge problem, we had to wait so long for it and only one of the two elevators worked. The elevator would always take you down to the basement where the cleaning supplies are for no reason. Parking is in the building beside the hotel so you have to walk a little ways to get anywhere. Our toilet bowl was black when we got there (toilet is white). The washrooms are ridiculously small.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117998111">Knowing nothing about Seattle, I checked on Trip Advisor for a well-located and not too expensive hotel. Overall, the reviews were very good and the location which is of utmost importance to us seemed excellent. It actually surpassed our expectations although the room was abit small. However, Seattle has so much to do that we were rarely in the room except to sleep. The staff could not have been nicer, the room was quiet and we were right across the street from the amazing library with buses (free from 6 AM to 7 PM) all around us. But since we are big walkers, we rarely took buses except occasionally since the hills are pretty steep getting back from the Waterfront. And the very elegant Fairmont was just one block away so this is in one of the finest neighborhoods in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117812023">I had stayed at the hotel a few years ago when I was in Seattle for a conference at the nearby conference center. This past weekend my wife and daughter stayed there after a long day of driving and attendance at the memorial for a family member. We were up early and away to get in some time at Pike Place Market nearby before getting back in the car. When we arrived home, my daughter thought she had left a Very Important action figure behind in the room. I sent off a quick email and received a prompt response and follow-up. Luckily we discovered Ironman concealed in some laundry at home. I was impressed by the swift personal response. I ill definitely stay here again on business or personal time when in Seattle in future.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117752407">This was quite lovely, small rooms but very clean. I was scared from the reviews but as usual the hype was overrated. I had a double bed room, actually had two rooms which I didn't need but that was what I booked on Hotels.Com for the special of $149/night. Parking validated with the hotel is $21 overnight stay. Very Close to EVERYTHING, including Bainbridge Ferry, Downtown Shopping area, Pike's Place Market. Mini Bar looked expensively scary so I didn't touch anything in there. Bathroom was small but I have stayed in old hotels before and this is just the way they were built. No real view as I was in the back of the building but then again I didn't spend the evening looking out the window. GOOD CLEAN HOTEL, Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby and it was awesome. The elevators worked the whole time I was there, then again I only stayed one night. Everyone was very sweet. There was no wine reception as the hotels.com web site stated but I asked what compensation they would give for that and they sent up two small small bottles of White Zin. I'm not really a wine drinker so it didn't matter much to me. I would definitely recommend and stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117546112">My brother and I stayed for two nights in late August. I'd made the reservation for two people a few months before, and when he asked to bring my nephew, I called the 1-800 number to see if cots were available. "Yes," said the operator, "but let me connect you to the local hotel so you can have it ready for you." The local hotel contradicted this: "We don't have any cots, but we can give you extra blankets." Fine. He brought his own cot. We arrived early and checked our bags; check-in was uneventful and the bellhop was friendly and eager to help. I returned to the hotel to get keys several hours later; no problem. The room was small, as I expected, but in several places had paint chips coming off the walls. The hot and cold water on the sink was reversed. The window overlooking the library across the street was dusty and had gunk in the tracks. The frosted glass bathroom door had liquid marks at various heights. I don't want to wonder what the waist-level liquid marks came from. When my brother arrived, he called down for the blankets for the cot. "We don't have any," said the desk. A hotel without blankets? Really? Fine. We pulled the comforter off the bed and let my nephew use it on his cot. I was fine with just a sheet until about 2 AM. The air conditioning works really, really well. The next morning, I was the first one in the shower. The water was up to my shins when I finished -- it wouldn't drain a drop. I messed with the drain plug in the murky water, but couldn't get it to a point where I could hear any water draining out. My brother messed with it, using the drain plug as a plunger, and got it to drain slowly. Ewww for him. We called maintenance, who fixed it while we were out, but seriously, isn't that something that housekeeping would have noticed the last time they cleaned the tub? Unless they don't clean the tub... On the way out that morning, my brother stopped housekeeping and asked them for an extra blanket. They were happy to provide one. If the hotel has no extra blankets, as the front desk said, I wonder who in the hotel had to sleep without one that night. We ate breakfast at the Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs. They were as good as expected. The rest of the stay was uneventful. The front desk was happy to split charges across my brother's and my credit cards, and the bell desk was efficient at checking our bags again. It's really got the feel of a two-star place that might have been a three-star place many years ago. Knowing what I know now, I'd shell out a few extra bucks for somewhere else.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117377497">We stayed at the Executive Hotel Pacific three days prior and one day post our Alaskan Cruise. The hotel is located about 40 min from the airport ($35.00 shuttle ride) on a steep road in downtown Seattle. We walked to all the major attractions and to Safeco Field for a ball game. Shuttled to the Cruise Ship terminal. The hotel is older, but very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are small so keep stuff organized. Bed super comfy! Bathroom also small but adequate for two people. "Seattles Best" coffee shop is attached and handy for breakfast. The hotel is advertised as "room and wine reception" I never saw any wine, but I didn't really care anyhow. I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117346636">My friend and I went to Seattle to see the sights for a couple days and after reading lots of reviews I had chosen to stay here. Based on the reviews I had read my biggest concern was the hotel being noisy and being able to hear through the walls. We didn't have a problem with this at all, although we did stay on a Wednesday night so it could be a different story on the weekend. I did hear a couple voices in the hallway in the morning, so I could see how if there were people around being loud you would be able to hear them. Now I will start from the beginning. They have a loading zone right in front of the hotel so that you can check in and unload your stuff before parking, which was very nice. We had a quick and easy check in and the guy even asked which floor we would like to stay on which I thought was nice, we ended up on 4. We used the self park parking which ended up being $23 cause there was tax since it was charged with your room, but that covered us from 4:30 when we checked in till 9pm the next day, amazing! Also some of the reviews made it sound like the parking garage was blocks away, there is an alley separating the hotel and the garage, they're right next to each other. I don't know what people were complaining about. The rooms are a bit on the small side but they look nice and we had all the room we needed. There is A/C in the room that seemed to work just great, we turned it off cause we got too cold. The beds were comfortable, I slept like a baby. Our only complaints were that there aren't fans in the bathrooms which makes it really difficult to clear the steam after a shower, and the bathroom door was rather loud to open and close because the doors are very old. The shower heads are fabulous though. Checkout was also super fast and all in all we had a wonderful stay and I will definitely stay there again next time I am staying in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116577217">My bf and I stayed for two nights in July 2011. We booked online and got a decent rate for a Deluxe King with wine reception. We were able to drop off our bags at 10am and park the car in the parkade. Upon our check in around 4 pm we discovered that there is no such thing as a "wine reception". They haven't started that program yet!!! False advertising...... Not that it's a huge deal, but c'mon...take it off the website. The room was pretty small, but really....we were only there to sleep. The bathroom was slightly larger than a medium closet. And there was no fan. Which is bizzarre. Maybe this is why a lot of the reviewers complain about the musty smell. Thanks to TA we brought a scented candle :) The bed was comfortable. Room temperature was perfect. We were supposed to have free wifi in the room, but alas.....there was no signal in the room. In the stairwell there was perfect reception, but not the room. In the morning i was able to pick up the Kimpton's signal from across the street. We complained three times about it. Apparently they rebooted the server, but that obviously didn't work. We had an iPad, iPhone and Blackberry...none of them were getting the hotel's signal. Not terribly impressed about that. But again...we were only there to sleep. But don't advertise things you don't have. The location was perfect. Close to Pike Place, the waterfront, the Ferries...... I would stay again, but only if I got a really good deal.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116541853">This "classic" property was likely once a happening spot located right in the center of Seattle. Alas, it's small European hotel-sized rooms are showing their age. Despite a few modern conveniences like rain shower heads and older model flat screen TVs the rooms feel tired and worn. The bathroom in my room, 804, was tiny with a sink the same size as an airplane bathroom and the toliet is so close to the wall it is almost unusable. We paid $200 which is a bit much given the age of the place and size of the room. On the positive side the girl at the front desk was happy and helpful as was the doorman.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116471728">The Executive Hotel Pacific was a gem and is located within blocks of all the sights of Seattleâ€™s city center. Built in 1928, the Pacific Executive Hotel has been restored to a wonderful level of comfort and has a Seattle's Best Coffee bar on its ground floor level. We selected the hotel as our starting point for our visit to the Pacific Northwest prior to our Alaskan cruise. The Hotel's location, it's nightly stay price point and it's website photos of the hotel were major factors for our choice of this property. We reserved two rooms online and got superb rates by navigating to the Manager's special section of their website. Our nightly room rate was $110.00 + tax and was a very good find for the location in the downtown of Seattle. The rooms were smartly decorated and took advantage of some of the historical features of the property like the vintage inset tiles in the floors of the bathrooms. Guests will find ample hot water in the bathrooms and the guest ammenities (towels, shampoos, soaps, etc.) were top quality. From the time of our arrival until our departure the staff provided friendly and attentive service. In conclusion, the Executive Hotel Pacific in the downtown of Seattle is a great find for those seeking a pleasant stay, at a historic property, without breaking their vacation budget. The hotelâ€™s website has lots of specials so check them out if your plans take you to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116407563">We go to Seattle often, but this is our first time staying at this hotel. We got a deal through expedia that made it less than half price, so we thought we'd try it out. The deal made it worthwhile, but I don't think I'd stay here for full freight. The recommendations on here that decry the small rooms, smaller bathrooms, paper thin walls and slow elevators are accurate. The service was good though, very friendly. If you can get it cheap it is an ok place to stay. Don't stay here if you expect $225/night quality.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116399421">If you stay here, DO NOT let the doorman check out for you. I had prepaid for the room in full, and was going to front desk to hand in the keys and check out, and the "helpful" doorman said, 'Oh, are you prepaid? Just give me the key card.' I did this, and rather surprisingly he almost escorted me out of the hotel. Anyway, I had a plane to catch, so did not want to argue and it was only when I got home that I thought I should at least get a copy of the bill, but when I contacted the hotel, they had charged me the full amount again! No apology, and they did not even bother denying what they had done. The whole thing had been set up, and they try to scam as many customers as they can with this trick. Forget that this is an old, smelly hotel - just don't stay here unless you want to pay double.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116287232">I had read several reviews before booking this hotel, and most of the positive ones were very true! Before staying here, you have to know that this hotel is older. They have done several renovations to upgrade the hotel. This hotel is not the nicest or fanciest hotel you will ever stay at, but it was located within walking distance of many of the destinations that we wanted to visit. If you are going to Seattle as a tourist, this hotel is perfect because you won't be in your room very often if you are out touring the city. The rooms and bathrooms were small, but again not that big a deal if you are in and out as quickly as we were. Stay here if you want a great deal and a safe, clean place to sleep at night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116209878">Take your money elsewhere! The hotel rooms are outdated and dirty! When we checked in we were ignored by the front desk attendants for more than 10 minutes while they talked among themselves. Once we got into our room, we opened the door and immediately saw that the room had not been cleaned (unmade bed, dirty room). We returned to the lobby and the attendants merely changed our room without apologizing. We got to our second room and were still not confident that the room was clean. My husband and I were too tired to fight a battle and got into bed after a LONG trip west. When we checked out, my husband told the front desk attendant that the rooms were not satisfactory and again... NO apology. Bizzare.

<comment category="negative" id="UR116171277">My wife and I recently stayed at the Executive Pacific and had a nice stay. The other reviews were correct in that the rooms are small (but not tiny), the bathrooms are small and the configuration is weird (don't care for the autoflush toilet)) and there was a bit of an odor from the room being both old and am sure smoking was allowed in years past. The elevators were not functioning properly so there was a bit of a wait for the one elevator that worked, was never a big problem for us as we were in no rush. The location was good, convenient to most things downtown and very close to the University Street Station for the light rail which worked out very good for us. Our room location was nice as it faced 4th street. Overall it was a good place to stay for the money compared to the prices being charged for the higher rated hotels. I would consider staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115777379">I spent two nights at the Executive Pacific in July . The staff was friendly and helpful, the room clean and perfectly comfortable -- not large (particularly the bathroom sink), but adequate for myself and a friend who didn't spend a lot of time there anyway. The location was great -- right across from the library and close to everything we wanted to see -- Pike Place, Pioneer Square, Elliott Bay, the Sculpture Garden, etc. I highly recommend it for anyone who isn't looking for high end luxury -- just a well-located, comfortable, inexpensive place (with a tad of European charm) to stay in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115630212">This hotel is situated in a business district but sightseeing and shopping are within easy walking distance. It is an older hotel and the lifts in it were certainally very slow (and noisy) during our stay. The room was small and the bathroom tiny, with a door which did not quite shut. There was air conditioning in the room which worked, but rattled. I think the best bit about this hotel was the proximity to places and the safety. A few blocks away the area did not seem to be quite so pleasant,, so we were pleased to have opted for the Executive Pacific for our short stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115537637">The bathroom is quite unique, i.e., the shower stall has a large slab of marble as most of one wall, the toilet is auto-flush, and the door is smoked glass. That said, while we were quite comfortable, for more than two people there would simply not be enough room, two could not be in the bathroom at once, and large people simply would not fit. This is a nice, boutique hotel in a great downtown location, close to everything, not to mention buses that go everywhere (downtown is quite parking-challenged )and light rail between the airport and hotel. Hotel staff were very knowledgeable and friendly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115510109">I booked a reservation at the Executive Hotel Pacific weeks ago, for a two day business trip. My reservation was confirmed and there was no notification that the status of my reservation had changed at all, but when I attempted to check in the front desk informed me that the hotel was overbooked and there was no longer a room available for me. This is where the adventure started. The girls at the desk, without asking me first, made reservations for me at a different hotel and *informed me* that my only option was to spend the night at this different hotel. When I asked for more information about the new hotel, The 6th Avenue Inn, they proceeded to lie to every question I asked. I asked if it was of a comparable quality to their hotel, they said yes, of course. It's absolutely not - it's a budget hotel with peeling, paint, dirty carpets, and smells like urine. I asked if it was still in a downtown location, they said yes, it was only a few min away from the Executive Pacific. It is not, it's at least a 20 min walk away and in a completely different, run-down part of the city on the fringe of down town. I asked if it was still in a nice area with a nice view and restaurants and shops nearby - they said yes, it's a lovely hotel that's right in the heart of a bustling shopping area. It is not - my room overlooks a parking lot and a highway, and the only things next to this hotel are a police station and a McDonalds. They proceeded to whisk me into a cab, they women from the front desk said "Don't worry, we'll tell the cab driver where to drop you off" - the cab then dropped me off at the Pan Pacific hotel, who, when I tried to check in there, informed me they had no idea what I was talking about. The *very nice* staff at the Pan Pacific then called the Hotel Executive to figure out what the hell was going on, and then informed me that the cab took me to the completely wrong hotel. They were also nice enough to have their town car drop me off at the 6th Avenue Inn at no charge, and the driver even accompanied me into the lobby to make sure that I had arrived at the right location this time! The Pan Pacific was booked solid, which is too bad, because they were absolutely lovely and I would have just stayed there! Once I arrived at the 6th Ave Inn and discovered it was COMPLETELY NOT what had been described to me by the Pacific staff, nor was it in any way worth the price I was paying per night at the Pacific, I called the Pacific and said that at this point I was exhausted and very upset, and they really needed to do something to rectify the situation - I did not want to spend the night in a room that smelled like urine. (No offense, 6th AVE - I will say that the people at your front desk were also lovely and kind to me - It seems every hotel in Seattle has professional staff EXCEPT for the Hotel Pacific.... Hm.) The woman who answered the phone informed me that there were no supervisors at the hotel in the evenings (Excuse me??? Are you kidding me??). After some back and forth, she agreed to call her manager's cell phone, but he or she did not pick up so now I am stuck at the 6th Ave Inn, it's already 8:30pm (and my body thinks it's 11:30pm EST), and apparently I'm having dinner tonight at McDonalds.

<comment category="negative" id="UR115496410">2 of our staff members were scheduled to stay at this hotel July 19th for a business meeting in downtown Seattle. A credit card authorization form was required. It was completed and included copies of the front and back of the corporate credit card. It was faxed as directed back to the hotel and we recieved a confirmation from our fax service that the transmission was successful ( 2 faxes so that both sides of the credit card read clearly). On the 18th of July we had not heard from the hotel and a number of calls were made to the hotel from the staff members themselves, and from the corporate office. No one ever called us back. We were told by the front desk that they did not have reservations and no rooms were available. They transferred our calls to another department that only had voice mail (that had a message stating that they would be out of the office June 17th through the 20th - a month old). Many messages were left, and we still haven't heard from anyone. This is just poor business. These staff members had a reservation, made in good faith, and guaranteed that the corporate card would pick up their charges. When that was provided, no call or email (which was not on ANY paperwork) have followed. We are disappointed and will not use this hotel again. Key Property Services, Inc.

<comment category="positive" id="UR115226852">You really can't get much better as far as location is concerned in downtown Seattle. We were right in the heart of everything. Walking distance to Space Needle and Pike's Market, and the start/finish of the Seattle Rock and Roll Marathon. The rooms were quaint, nothing special, but clean and nice. They have the older-style elevators which were fun and the lobby joins to a Seattle's Best Coffee Shop, which is convenient. It's a little inconvenient that the lobby and the entrance to the elevators are separated by about 10 steps, which means you have to drag your luggage up those steps to get to the elevator. Overall, not that big of a deal. The bell-hop, Stanley, was so helpful to us in pointing us toward the right eateries and attractions, so ask for Stanley!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115210003">While the bed was nice and I slept like the dead, the room itself was smaller than most walk in closets. In addition, the hotel has very little amenities. The only thing you can find is a Seattle's Best coffee shop in the lobbey. If you are looking for a hotel for a couple or with enough room for more than one piece of luggage - look elsewhere. Oh, and the parking was just too much. Park outside of town and take the light rail in. It'll cost you only $2.50 instead of upwards of $30.00 a night to park.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR114946741">This isn't the place to stay if you are looking for a luxury hotel. But, given the location and the price, this place rises to the top. We stayed here twice in a little over a week--the night we arrived in Seattle, and the night before we flew out. Both nights, we had rooms that were clean, comfortable, and quiet. I agree that the rooms and the bathrooms are small. However, they were spotless, which to me is more important. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We had read some of the negative reviews and decided that, if our first visit wasn't satisfactory, we would go somewhere else for our second night. Needless to say, we didn't find that to be necessary. Location is wonderful, and we will definitely consider this hotel again if we head back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR114416365">We chose to book this hotel even though it wasn't the cheapest, because the name "Executive" lends itself to a certain standard that the cheaper hotels didn't have. While the lobby, bell hop, and front desk area were all well polished, the elevator was completely dodgy (mis-matched buttons, jerky and rickety and VERY noisy, the doors opened before you were at your floor, etc) and the rooms were pretty average. While the finishings and overall appearance of the rooms was nice, the crown moulding was about 1/2 inch away from the ceiling, the toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom was at eye level when you are on the toilet, the bathroom itself had a glass door to the bedroom, not a wooden door (not bad, just weird). In the hallways, the wallpaper was peeling off the wall and all of the trim work was well dented and scratched. We were on the 8th (top) floor, and during the night it was almost unbearable with the noise from the elevator. Though we were on the opposite end of the floor from the elevator, the noise kept us up most nights. The hotel also placed us in a room with a door going through to an adjoining room, but did not consult us if this was okay before doing so. Let me tell you: it was NOT okay - the walls and door were so paper-thin that we could hear the neighbour sneezing, drawing their shower curtain and talking quietly. I think the problem with this hotel is that the building was so old and try as they might to give it facelifts to make it an "Executive" hotel, it falls very short of executive status. We would not stay at this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR113388229">The hotel is clean, and the location is right across the street from the library and within walking distance of Pike's Market. There is a Seattle's Best in the hotel, and other hotels on either corner for more substantial meals. It's an old hotel with 8 floors and only 2 elevators. Shortly after we arrived and were assigned our room on the 8th floor, both elevators broke. The desk clerk reassigned us to a larger room on the 2nd floor since we had to take the stairs to our room, and the bell captain was great helping us move our luggage. All in all, we were pleased with the hotel for the price. One tip, DON'T TAKE THEIR SHUTTLE. It costs twice as much as a taxi ($16 to the wharf for 2), and you have to go with them to drop off other passengers at their destination. A taxi is only $8, and takes you directly there.<topic>none</topic>

Hotel staff ranged from very helpful to totally bored. This hotel has great potential, with a little bit of TLC. As is it seems expensive for what you get.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR112745044">This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff is friendly, but doesn't make up for the poor condition of the hotel itself. To start off with, you have to either go up steps or down steps to get to the elevator so forget about using a cart to take your luggage to your room. The rooms are small and furniture is shabby. The walls are very thin and rooms noisy. In the bathroom in my room, you can't put the toilet lid up without it hitting the handle to flush the toilet so you have to kind of sit down and lean forward so the lid doesn't go back and hit the handle or you have an instant bidet. I've stayed in better economy hotels than this is. The location is great, but the hotel is not worth the price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR110433191">The hotel was conveniently located downtown near attractions and had a very friendly staff (someone was always at the desk 24-7 and helped direct us to downtown areas). Free Wi-Fi and printer access was a plus. The room and bathroom was very clean and I felt was spacious relative to the price and the area we were staying. My wife and I reserved a hotel reservation using an online special in March 2011 for a great rate. We planned to stay here on the way back from an Alaskan cruise so we could see downtown before catching our plane back home through SEA-TAC airport. I called a few weeks ahead of time to confirm and even received an automated e-mail 2 days before hand confirming our stay. However, when we arrived they could not find us with the e-mail printout reservation number or by our last name. At first I panicked, because the hotel was very full and I was concerned I was going to be stuck going somewhere else for 3X the price given that the summer season had just started. I am not sure exactly what happened (computer glitch?) but the staff was very patient and worked hard to find a room for us. We ended up checking in a little later but we got a complementary shuttle to the airport the next morning (normally $35-$40 from downtown) and upgraded to a king size bed. A mixup like this could happen anywhere, but what is important is if it does how the problem is handled. I was very impressed on how the staff was very polite and geniunely concerned to make sure we were taken care of. Highly recommend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR109840783">Upon arrival it seemed that we may have chosen a decent hotel. Once we got to our room after waiting forever for the elevator (one was broken), the door opened with a rush of hot stale air. There was nothing we could do to fix it. They gave me some excuse about the boiler was off or something like that. Tried the old junky air unit by the window which had no effect. Tried to open the window but it was limited to just a few inches, so no one can jump out due to heat stroke. They were nice enough to bring us an old dusty fan which gave the room a little wind chill. The decor was unsightly and the bed was as bad as it gets. The upside to the stay was the location.

<comment category="positive" id="UR107808807">Had an enjoyable 2 night stay here in a central location in downtown Seattle. The hotel is 5 minute to central shopping area and 10 minutes to Pike Place markets. It is also only 10 minutes to the waterfront but beware the steep climb to come back that way. The University St SoundLink light rail station is only a block away which is convenient for traveling to/fro SeaTac airport. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and was promptly checked in on the 4th floor in a smallish room but it was clean and looked quite modern. Not a bad look for an older style building. They are currently renovating the 5th floor and 1 of the elevators. The current elevators are old and pretty slow and I found myself running the stairs most times but that would not be practical if you were on a higher floor or had luggage. The lobby and mezzanine level with the free business centre looks great. I went downstairs and asked the front desk for some dining out suggestions for the Sunday night and they had no ideas for me, suggested I order pizza delivery. As I wasn't feeling like pizza I took a walk and found heaps of places within a few blocks and decided on eating at a British pub.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR106270780">I stayed in this hotel for one night in January 2010 (not May, but I guess TA doesn't go back that far). Haven't been back since, and won't be back, but I remember my impression of the hotel vividly. The website fooled me with it's shiny and well kept-looking photos. This hotel is definitely old, and is definitely in serious need of a thorough update. It would be a pretty cool boutique hotel if this were to happen. My room was around the corner from the elevator, and the noise from that was literally constant. It's true the walls are paper thin. We could practically make word for word of our neighbors conversation. Either it's literally been ages since the walls have been washed, or the no-smoking rule is not enforced, but there was a stuffy, smokey, mushroomy stench throughout the entire hotel. The room, and bathroom, did NOT feel clean and were SO tiny. I was expecting to take a pack of bed bugs home with me. My biggest issue was with the headboard... It was a faux leather material, with huge scratches/gauges scraped throughout, which was pretty sketchy to me. I also had an excellent view of a neighboring concrete building, with an alley of dumpsters below. (If concrete is an unappealing view for you, beware of hotels with online photos of their rooms with the blinds/drapes closed... big red flag!) I personally like things bright, spacious, charming, and clean. If you do too, this is not the hotel for you. It is not at all luxurious. The location is pretty good and central (being from Seattle it's not the location I would want, but close enough), and of course the prices are great for downtown. My stay was pretty basic- just needed a bed- so I have no idea about their amenities if they have any.<topic>none</topic>

This was one of the only budget options in the area and we were initially nervous that it might be kind of worn down after reading some of the reviews on TA. And while there were signs of wear and tear here and there, we were more than happy with our stay. The staff was extremely nice and very helpful even providing us with complementary umbrellas when it rained one day. Our room was not small, it wasn't huge but hardly small. No idea what other reviewers are complaining about there. They only negative was that the walls are a bit thin, so you will hear noise from the halls and elevator from time to time, but we only heard noise during the day - at night it was quiet. We used the hotel's small business center and were able to check our email, check in for our flight and print our boarding pass all for free.

<comment category="negative" id="UR102377925">One of my favorite things about staying at this particular hotel is that it isn't pricey and the location is great. It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places. His suggestions were wonderful!<topic>none</topic>

I am deaf in one ear and I could almost decipher every spoken word - spoken, not 'yelled'! Of course I spoke to them and shut them up, but the point is the hotel is so old, the walls are 'paper thin'. Our room also faced 4th Ave and the street noise was quite loud. We could not sleep with the window open as a result but even when closed the sounds were loud. A little money spent soundproofing is in order. Our room with two double beds was also quite small and short of space. But again, it is an older hotel. The staff are all wonderful, and the location great, but your money is better spent elsewhere. And it is certainly worth it to spend more if you want a downtown experience. However, if you want to only have a four hour sleep and grouchy teens the next day, stay here!<topic>none</topic>

However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldnâ€™t sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise. I cannot fathom why they do not rent this room sparingly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR100784582">This was my second time staying at this hotel; I travel to WA every few months for business and will not be staying at this hotel again. Not that it was the worst place Ive ever stayed, but as a solo female traveler I didn't feel comfortable. The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up. When I notified an attendent my vehicle had been broken in to and items stolen he just shrugged and walked away. For the cost of the room and parking (nearly $200 for one night) it wasnt worth the hassles and condition of the room.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR99793614">First of all this is an old building and right in the middle of downtown. If you have any issues with noise bring earplugs or suck it up and stay further out. I really liked the hotel alot and feel I got a great stay for the price. The rooms are small but clean and nicely decorated. I intially got a noisy room near the center of the hotel but when I mentioned this to the desk they kindly moved me to another room since there was space avalable. The whole trip all the staff was freindly and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay and I have to say it was soooo convient to all the sites. We walked alot and when we drove it was fine. The garage is cramped and behind the hotel about a half block. Amazing I read reviews that peeps complained about that. If you cant walk half a block then no use in staying on downtown anyways. Over all I think this was a excellent choice!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR99461719">I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest price for downtown seattle. My inexperience as a hotel picker was quickly apparent when we finally arrived in our room after having to walk around the block from the parking garage to the hotel lobby because it doesnt lead into the hotel at all. Lucky for us we were just staying for one night so we packed lightly. We walked into the room and noticed it was recently remodled yet extremely small. There was no table like you see in most hotels. All of this I can deal with but the single worst thing about this place is that the walls are virtually non-existent. My neighbors were not being too loud however you can hear people talking at a normal level. You can hear every toilet flush in the rooms around you. This is not good for a light sleeper such as myself. I guess if your a partier and want to go stay out all night and need a bed to come pass out in then this place might work. I guess the one good thing to come out of this is that now I know that you get exactly what you pay for. And to do a little more research on a hotel before I make reservations.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR98449861">this was my last stop after a week in europe. i really liked my room and the bed was very comfy. but the walls were obscenely paperthin. i could hear what my neighbors were watching on TV. the ice machine on my floor did not work and had bugs on the bottom of the inside. my toilet was clogged. location was close to the light rail and close enough to other attractions to make it worthwhile for 1 night, but i could not get to sleep due to the noise. ill pay more next time for a hotel with thicker walls.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98246548">We stayed at the EHP during the coldest days in Seattle and had a great time. The staff was very friendly and helped us with bus routes, and light rail, and places to eat nearby. The hotel is in a convenient location to Pike's Place Market, and shopping if you wear good walking shoes. The room was small, but clean and warm during the coldest nights of the year.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR97105758">This hotel was perfect for a girls shopping trip in Seattle. The price was great, especially for the location - the rooms are small, however if you don't plan on spending much time in them, it shouldn't be a problem. The beds were comfortable, more so than the average hotel room. The only downside is you can hear everything happening in the hallway, so if you attempt to sleep in you'll be woken by a vacuum at 8 a.m. Luckily the other guests staying here were respectful, and we rarely heard them. The staff were friendly and constantly helpful, they allowed us to check in early before we hit the stores. Parking was right next door to the hotel, and only $21 - which I think is a good deal for downtown seattle. I'm suprised travellers are shocked that they must pay for parking at a hotel - it's pretty standard in large cities where parking is at a premium.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR96925429">First of all, the room was so small. I expected it to be cozy, and properly equipped, but it was neither. There was no table to eat at.. just a desk. In-room meals had to be eaten on the bed, or over one's lap. The staff graciously upgraded my family to a "King-Size Suite" which just consisted of a larger bed.. (which in turn made the room even smaller). The Bedding was stained, the staff didn't clean the room until I personally requested it.. TERRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I opted for valet service, and for the extra charge, I think it would have been better to have just self-parked. Why in the world would a guest at a hotel have to pay to park there?! The staff did NOT help us with our bags, even though we obviously had our hands full, there was no ramp so all luggage had to be transported manually. The elevator took at least 5 minutes to get to the floor, and its button didn't work half the time. The doors on the elevator nearly crushed me, as they do not have safety sensors.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR96743283">An older hotel kept clean by a friendly staff. The location is downtown, close to Pike Market. Easy to/from airport by Light Rail for $2.50. Perfect place to explore downtown Seattle by foot. The rooms are more quaint than spacious, but cute in their old style way. Yes, you get sounds from the city, the hum of the elevator, and can hear your neighbors come and go, but this is a delightful hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR96258708">My husband and I had a combined business/pleasure trip to Seattle last week and stayed one night in the Executive Hotel Pacific. We picked the hotel because it was close to our business appointment, close to the tourist area on the piers along Elliot Bay, and extremely reasonably priced. Throughout our stay the Executive Pacific staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. This hotel is older, with worn carpeting on our floor, but very clean, with newer furnishings in our room. Our bed was very, very comfortable. My husbandd had noticed on their website that they would offer a complimentary upgrade if space was available. So he asked and we received a complimentary upgrade from a queen to a king room with a view of Elliot Bay. This hotel is within walking distance of tourist activity on the bay front, financial district, Pioneer Square, the Amtrak station and if you are a good walker it's not that far to the Space Needle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR95793756">Starting off we were charged an EXTRA 25$ per night for parking (and that was discounted because we were staying in the hotel) For the price we paid... it should have been free. No drop off area.. you have to stop traffic on the street. The lobby was beautiful and love that it was connected to a coffee shop. The lady at the front desk was not welcoming or very nice. The rooms were WAY TOO small and old timey. The locks didn't work and doors/light switches were oddly placed. And I was woken up in the middle of the night by the cleaning crew. It was a good location I guess... We could have stayed somewhere bigger for the same price, and will next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR93393116">The price was affordable, which attracted us to the hotel. Everything else was downhill. We checked into a room on the 2nd Floor. The hotel promises wi-fi, but there was no signal in our room. We moved to a room on the 6th floor. After unpacking we realized there were no privacy curtains and that our bathtub was clogged. We promptly put in a request to fix both. More than 24 hours later, still no resolution. We promptly checked out, and for a mere $15 more per night, checked into a 4-star hotel across the street (who gave us free wi-fi, complimentary breakfast, room service, and had a gym/pool).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR92817980">I found the Executive Hotel Pacific on the net; I was looking for a hotel near the SAM (our primary reason for going was to see the Picasso exhibit) at a reasonable price. The EHP exceeded our expectation. it had a very nice urban vibe and was staffed by very friendly, helpful and fun people. The room was clean and well appointed. We appreciated the comfy bed and crisp white linens. The bathroom could have had some supplemental heat- but otherwise it was great. We were able to walk to all of the sites we were interested and had two great dinners near by (Serious Pie and Brooklyn ). There was parking right next door, but we walked everywhere so we weren't going in and out. Must say, I was also pleased to know the chain is Canadian based- happy to support the locals and the good folk back home. Highly recommend this place - can't beat it for the price !<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR91472777">If you're looking for a romantic weekend getaway...not the place. If you are looking for somewhere central and simple while visiting Seattle - it's perfect! I stayed here with friends for the New Years and found it clean, friendly, and a good value. There aren't a lot of amenities, but honestly of you're in Seattle you want to explore - not spend your days in the hotel room. This place reminded me the hotels you find in many European cities.I would recommended this place for friends looking to explore Seattle an young couples looking to get away without spending a lot. Best thing about this place...location, location, location. Plus, near a Link station so it ha easy access to the Airport.<topic>none</topic>

Great location, great price and the room was fine. While I would not choose this hotel if I planned to spend a lot of time in the room (the bathroom is particularly tiny...), it was the perfect choice for an overnight visit that included a visit to the nearby Seattle Art Museum, dinner near Pioneer Square and shopping. Friendly staff and Seattle's Best Coffee connected to the lobbymade it extra nice. Will stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

We chose your hotel because of the convenient location to almost every attraction in Seattle was in walking distance or by transit. We booked a superior queen room but was pleasantly surprised to get upgraded to a king. The room was small but it was cozy and it suited us just fine. The staff at Executive Pacific was AWESOME!! Everyone from the concierge, front desk to even the maid service were all so friendly, helpful and very personable!! The only thing that I would change would be that the robes in the room were geared for a petite individual but then I didn't think to ask if they had larger sizes.

<comment category="positive" id="UR88482126">The location of this hotel was perfect for our art-get-away weekend. The valet was at the door waiting for our Jeep, and the clerk at the counter had our room information ready for us before we approached the count. The room was a little on the small side, but staying in the room was not our goal. When we did return to the room after a lot of walking to see the art museum and downtown seattle, we found a very clean room waiting for us to retire. The only down fall of the stay was the behaviors of other guests, a little on the noisey side. We will stay there again. They took very good care of us. Thank you!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR87286949">You can't beat the price given the great downtown location - but this place is definitely more "motel 6' than 'executive'. They've tried hard to 'charm up' the tiny, old rooms, but it still looks kind of cheap and dingy. Room was unbearably hot (in November(!) but the AC didn't work. Luckily the window opens a bit - fresh air was great, city noise was not. Comfortable bed, but room wasn't super-clean. Free internet was definitely a big plus. If you are visiting downtown Seattle on a budget, this is a great place for you - but don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86701670">My stay was perfect in every respect except for two concerns. I prefer a low temperature for sleeping. As I was unable to open the window, I did turn on the blower on the ventilation system. However, the room temperature was still above what I desired. If AC could be provided year around, that would be wonderful. I have no idea whether plates and silverware are obtainable from the front desk, as I didn't ask. However, I was given take-out menus from various restaurants and ordered food from one of these. I happened to have a plastic fork in my belongings - otherwise, I would have not had a method for consuming my food.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86586142">I arrived at the Executive Hotel Pacific late on Sunday night and was helped by the front desk efficiently and kindly. Since I booked online, I received my free ipod gift card; they even offered to take my 1 bag upstairs but I refused. I questioned the front desk agent for a good 30 minutes in terms of technicalities about the surrounding areas and my room assignment and she patiently and willingly answered everything! I put in a request for a quiet room and they fulfilled that: I was given a room on one of the topmost floors in the corner and it had a breathtaking view of the Bay and City. I am eternally grateful for that! The room itself was furnished so cleanly and elegantly. There was a retro bathroom, high quality bathroom products, very chic accents throughout the room and it was well lit! There was a huge desk and comfy chair, flat screen TV, and the king bed was gigantic and extremely comfortable. I would always call the front desk with my questions and they would always ask me. This hotel is a few blocks from the link rail system which is the train that goes from SEATEC airport to downtown seattle. It is a quick walk (~5 minutes). You are also steps from the harbor (~ 5 minutes), aquarium, and all that good stuff! It is a beautiful location and very safe especially at night since there is a hotel guard at the front. There is a Seattle's Best coffee shop downstairs connected to the lobby. If you book online, you get a super discount. i got a buy 3 nights get the 4th free deal which came out to roughly $100 per night for a superior king. They also have a free computer lounge and free WIFI which was super convenient. No fridges though but if you find a hotel with a fridge in downtown seattle that doesn't make you pay for it all the power to you! Altogether, my stay was exceptional. I had absolutely no complaints! The service was phenomenal, the room was really comfy/cozy, and the hotel staff was out of this world nice! Every single person who I interacted with was so genuine and kind. They go the extra mile all the time. Don't stay anywhere but here. It is just as classy and wonderful as the Sheraton/ Hilton, etc... but it is substantially cheaper.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86446667">My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend getaway after three months apart. We spent very little time in the room since we wanted to do all the touristy things in Seattle, but it was always so nice to come back to our nice, comfortable room. The rooms are recently remodeled but still retain some of their "charm." This isn't really a "luxury" hotel, but it is definitely comfortable, clean, and quiet (considering it's right downtown). The location could not be better, an easy walk to Pike's, the aquarium, shopping, tons of restaurants etc. The space needle is about a 30 minute walk, but we opted for a cab which was under $10. The service from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out was phenomenal. You can't beat the price for the quality of room, location, and awesome service. Will definitely be staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86332427">I wanted a hotel that was reasonable in price, located in downtown, clean, and offered self parking at a reasonable rate rather than valet parking which I refuse to use primarely because I don't want some stranger driving my vehicle and I'm not lazy enough to require someone else to park my car for me. I got all of those things at the Executive Hotel Pacific. The room was small but comfortable. We were upgraded to a king room when I had reserved a queen which was a nice surprise and I'm guessing doesn't happen everytime.

<comment category="positive" id="UR85415326">Prior to booking a two night stay at the Executive Hotel Pacific, I read reviews from other guests saying it was "very old". Since I am from New York City, I thought it was actually very cute! It is not stuffy like other hotels that seem to overdo the decor with tacky art and nursing home colors. It is near Pike Place Market, Pioneer Place, the International District and great stores and restaurants. I say "near" because I walk everywhere in NYC and the major areas seemed pretty walkable to me. The only thing I wish for is a vending machine of refreshments because weather can be unpredictable and I do not feel like battling the elements.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR84231225">We stayed here for one night during the week of Labor Day this year. We arrived pretty late as we drove up the coast from Lincoln City, OR that day. Upon arriving, I was impressed with the staff. The front doormen held the door open and greeted us with friendly smiles. The front desk clerk was also very friendly and greeted us with a smile. After getting checked in, we headed to the elevators. I noticed right off the bat that the elevators were very old, but although they were a tad bit rickety, they still functioned. The hallways could use new carpet and decorations, but they didn't smell bad. The room was very nice with a plush king sized bed that made for a good night's sleep. The room also had nightstands, a desk, and television. The bathroom was very nice as well. My only complaint with the room was that it was very small with very little room around the bed, and the bathroom was cramped. Nice room with very little space. As for the location, this hotel is located in the heart of downtown right next to the interestingly structured library. It is situated in the free transportation district of town and is minutes away from Pioneer Square and Pikeâ€™s Market. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, and I will definitely look it up the next time I am in town.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR83294196">I knew that this hotel was 2/3rd the cost of the W next door, so didn't expect luxe accommodations. But my floor reeked of mold from the broken ice machine, the "air conditioning" couldn't bring the room temp down a single degree, and the window opened only a fraction, so sleep was hard to come by. Other issues: - Mattress was well past its prime, you could feel the springs through the top foam - Room was very small, bathroom awkwardly small - Tub didn't drain properly - No desk to write at (odd for a hotel named Executive) Water pressure was good, and staff did their best with what they have been given. Mgmt needs to invest in the infrastructure though. I'm going to ask my company to take this hotel off its list of preferred vendors when I get home. Lots of overseas visitors -- it makes me sad that this is their first stop. If your budget is counted out to the pennies, and you plan to do no work in the hotel room, just sleep there, and you don't mind a room temp closer to 80 than 60, and you aren't allergic to mold, might be your best option in this part of $town$.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR83252879">the negatives: -the A/C turns on but does not actually work...(it was too warm in our room and the window only opens a little bit) -when you turn the A/C off it still kind of makes noise...(bring ear plugs) -the clock radio had a connection for your MP3 which was GREAT...but the wire was split so it would constantly turn on/off...so that was kind of a bummer. -the view, sucked...(but we weren't there for the view) -the walls were thin; you could hear your neighbors...(again, bring ear plugs) -the bathroom door did not close - the only way it will close is if you lock it... -there was no fan in the bathroom... -the light wasn't working near the bed but after leaving a note for house keeping they fixed it... the positives: -it was clean -the bed was very cozy -the staff seemed friendly -a coffee shop is connected to the hotel so you can get a fresh cup of joe first thing in the morning -good location<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR82918401">This hotel room is average in every respect. From the front desk personnel, to the room itself it's all just okay. If you're looking for something special or memorable this is NOT the place for you! (i'd suggest you spend an extra $40 dollars and stay somewhere plush like the Pan Pacific) But if your objective is an affordable, safe, clean hotel room, without the frills, the Executive Hotel Pacific may be just the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR82262041">A/C didn't work, and window opened less than one inch. Bathroom door had no latch or fan, so we were afraid to use it and stink ourselves out. Decorations looked circa 1974. Counter at the desk was granite, and fractured like someone hit it with a sledgehammer. Computer didn't work in business center, and noise outside was loud all night long. We left the second night of our 5 day stay. Don't ever stay here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81973255">My husband and I spent two nights here for our recent trip to Seattle. I had read reviews online before booking and read mostly positive comments so I thought we'd try it. I booked two nights online and got a $10 itunes giftcard when I checked in! The hotel is in a great location for walking around downtown. It was very clean and the staff was nice and helpful. The room was very comfortable, too. The room and the bathroom were on the smaller side (okay, they were small) but it was fine for us. We wanted to stay downtown and were on a budget. I was happy with the room and the location. My only complaint would be the a/c. I called the front desk and was told that it may take some time to cool off since it hadn't been on long. I turned it on and the room would not cool off. It was on all night and only moved the air around a little without getting much cooler. The next day I saw that housekeeping had a fan and we asked if we could use it. That night we opened the window (I thought they didn't open the first night) and had the fan pulling in the cool air and we slept great. I think this is a great option if you want to be within walking distance of the market, Pioneer Square, shopping downtown, etc. There are several trendier hotels nearby but they are also going to be a lot more expensive. This is an older hotel but I think they've done a good job updating it and making it look nice and stay comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and would just make sure I asked for a fan when I checked in or when I made the reservation. Also we took the Light Rail from Seatac for only $5 for the both of us and it stopped within a few blocks from the hotel which was great!<topic>none</topic>

I was informed we would NOT be charged for our stay (we were only there a few hours) - after arguing with the desk clerk, the manager overheard us and said "we will not charge you" It has been a week and it appears I will need to call and get the credit card charge reversed (we WERE charged!).

<comment category="negative" id="UR81397352">This hotel is in a very very good location in Seattle. However, the weather was quite warm in Seattle (unusual for September they say) and the A/C had been turned off ! So they had a hotel full of uncomfortable travellers and could only say "sorry". Other than that the bed was good, the room was a bit small but functional, clean and nicely decorated. Probably won't stay there again since the management is not interested in the comfort of the guests.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR81335749">Had a 3 night stay for a sightseeing trip. First impressions were the hotel is small with no central area/lobby. Reception is in a small corner, and what would have been the lobby is a 'Seattle's Best Coffee' shop. Staff were friendly and helpful on arrival. Like others I was offered by the internet booking agency the addition of breakfast for $10 which luckily I declined as it doesn't exist. I experienced one other guest who had prepaid it being told there was no such thing, so beware. The rooms are very small, and a little tired as in worn carpets and old fixtures/fittings. Except the TV which is modern flat screen. However, everything was clean and the bed extremely comfortable. Location is good, a few blocks from almost everything in downtown/Pike Market and Pioneer square. Free wifi too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR81278080">Stayed here for one night at the end of September. it is clearly an old hotel that has been remodeled. They've done a good job - the lobby, our room and the bathroom were decent, but the elevator was still very rundown and dated and the hallway on our floor had a bit of a musty smell (as well did the closet in our room). It is in a great location and very reasonably priced compared to other downtown hotels, the two items I noted above wouldn't stop me from staying here again - however, the heat in the hotel would. It was SO HOT! There is no A/C and the windows in the room only open a couple inches. There are also no fans in the bathroom. I left my room to get outside to cool off and encoutered others in the elevator who were also complaining about the heat. If they were to add air conditioning I would stay here again, but I couldn't stay here again without it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR80101958">A friend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights and it was nothing like the photos online at the hotel's website-very deceiving. The carpeting in the main entryway of the hotel is filthy; the complimentary apples stale. We had to try three different rooms as each reeked of smoke, and the desk clerk did not care about the fact that my friend and I are both allergic to smoke. The room we stayed in was filthy-wallpaper dirty and peeling off in every corner, mildew, an air vent that was half out of the ceiling and caked with dirt and grime (has to be a code violation). Our power went out both mornings. When we asked the desk clerk to speak to a manager, or asst. manager, we were told both weren't available until after our stay was over. I have stayed in many hotels in Europe and even the Middle East and Thailand and have never had such a terrible experience! I felt like I needed a shower after staying there!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR79512744">We stayed here for two nights for the Seahawks home opener. My husband warned me that the rooms were small, but I was not prepared for how small they really were!!! We booked a superior room, but there was no room for anything, we were constantly shuffling our stuff around and tripping over one another. The worst part was the bathroom, and the sink faucet. It was leaking so bad that we called the front desk - they sent someone up and he fixed it to a slow leak but it was still driving us nuts, so we ended up turning off the main water lines to the sink. Someone in the room next to us wasn't feeling well (we know this because of the thin walls) and was up all night getting sick into his toilet - and lucky us we heard it all night. I mentioned to one of the employees about the sink and he wasn't concerned, just told me that this is an old hotel...

The staff are excellent - friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location is perfect for accessing all of Seattle's wonderful sights within walking distance, particularly Pike's Fish Market, which is so much more than just a fish market. However, the rooms smell of mildew from old carpets, The furnishings are very old and greatly need to be updated. The bathroom was basic but needs remodeling - ex. our shower pipe was extended out of the wall with a clear gap in the wall behind it. The cleaners are not good - they don't speak English very well and asking for anything extra brings little or no results. However, once they finally do clean the rooms, they are well kept, but they are very slow and obviously not motivated.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR74965556">This hotel is charming, right in the heart of downtown. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our four-legged family member was welcomed with open arms. The rooms reminded me of Manhattan hotels with excellent space economy. We had a pleasant stay, would recommend this hotel to friends and definitely will return again when next in Seattle. We were really excited that the soaps and lotion are vegan and of excellent quality. The bed was super-comfy and I did not miss my pillows from home. We do not usually use room service, so I cannot speak for that amenity or lack there-of but there are hundreds of options all within walking distance from this location. The SAM and Pike Market as well as numerous other sites are within walking distance. Our room's view was not great (alleyway) but this afforded noise protection from street sounds. We happened to be there during the Torchlight Parade for a local festival. The parade went right in front of the hotel. A fun surprise. http://heldveganbelts.com<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR73186593">i stayed here for a night last week. this week i'm here for six. Because of the longer stay,i asked for a room on the outside of the building rather than the internal ones which overlook the noisy, polluted, filthy concrete jungle of airconditioning units and a multi-storey carpark. I was lead to believe that I was given one, but no, I had the same outlook as before. When I arrived, both rooms smelt and had the air conditioners going full bore, despite the cool weather - I assume it was in a failed attempt to rid the room of smell. There are no fridges in the room either. The lifts are decrepit (take ages to get to you) and tatty. For what you get, it is expensive.<topic>none</topic>

The only logical space for the crib leaves appx. 6" of space to exit the room... Total fire hazard. When I called the front desk to see if there was a larger room option, I was told all the rooms were the same size. This is a total falsehood because our aunt stayed on the same floor with a much larger room. I then went to the front desk and was told there was no other option. Very dissapointed.

<comment category="positive" id="UR70277385">My husband and I were a bit worried about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but we were happy with our stay. Yes, the room was very small, but the furnishings were more original and better quality than I expected, especially considering the low price. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We stayed with our dog, a large greyhound, and a number of features made the place convenient: good potty spot across the street, a living room type area just above the lobby. We were able to take turns popping into the Seattle's Best coffee shop next to the lobby to get our coffee/breakfast sandwiches and relax in the living area with hotel-provided newspapers, breakfast, and a relaxed doggy on the floor. There wasn't enough room in our hotel room to spread out like this, and without the nice living room area, we would have had to take the dog out to car so that we could go eat. The self-park is very convenient for people want to keep their dog in the car while they go out to eat, etc. Some places only offer valet parking, which can be inconvenient if you are using your car as a dog kennel. It's nice, safe, clean, friendly, and cheap. I like the Monaco Hotel across the street, but at a hundred dollars less a night, the Executive Hotel is a better deal. Oh, one odd thing: the counter/shelf was about 1/4 inch too low... the toilet seat hit it when in the lifted position. Inconvenient for a man to have to hold it up the whole time. Bring a piece of tape... haha. No other problems with the bathroom though. We stayed on the 4th of July, by the way.<topic>none</topic>

The decor has an Art Nouveau feel to it, which might be a bit off-putting to people who prefer more contemporary surroundings. If you appreciate the (somewhat) unusual, you will enjoy your stay here. Staff were friendly and attentive. Location is excellent and close to Pike Place Market without being too close. Aside from typical hotel noises (neighbors opening and closing their doors as they left), we did not have to deal with anything annoying or distracting.

<comment category="negative" id="UR68829884">We stayed at this hotel based on the price and proximity to Safeco Field. The hotel had multiple issues that I wouldn't have expected for something that is advertised as "luxury and boutique". The room was very small, 2 full beds (not queen), no table, no chair, basically nowhere to set your things. The bathroom was the same. The single 6" wide shelf was over the toilet, so you really didn't want to set personal hygiene items there. None of the vending machines worked, leaving you to have to walk 8 blocks to get something to drink at night. The air conditioner couldn't keep up. The tub didn't drain properly, leaving you standing in 6" of water. On the converse, the front desk and valet staff were VERY nice. Unfortunately, they have to deal with the lack of concern that management must have about the property. I would probably not stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR67705473">We booked this hotel for 2 nights and left after the first only because it was pre-paid and we could not find another hotel. The room smelled like a gym locker. The bathroom looked 'reasonably' clean, but the tub needed replacing.... When I stepped into the tub the floor of the tub felt 'sloshy' and it had several cracks. As your moved around in the tub it felt like there was water beneath it and it was sloshing around. I think there was water under there - old, rotten, diseased bath water. The bath drain would not stay in open position so that made it worse. The bad thing is that we could of booked another 5 star hotel for about $5 dollars more over by the space needle, but we were not familiar with that area. I would check the room pryor to signing any papers and I would not pre-pay for rooms in this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR66812781">I don't like to complain, but I can't help it with this one. I really didn't enjoy my stay, but I was trying to find a reasonable rate in a prime location, during a peak season. It's true what they say... you get what you pay for. So I will start with the positive... The hotel's location is price. Nestled on the corner of 4th and Spring, this property is conveniently located to almost everything. This is what I wanted, and this is what I got. The price was right for the location and peak season. I don't think I could have found anything cheaper in the area. I paid about $170.00 including self parking. I love old, historical-ish buildings with character. This is for sure an old building and there is character. Too bad things aren't kept up a little better. The bed was very comfortable, but I'm not giving too much credit here because most hotels have comfy beds these days. The connecting restaurant, Jasmin was nice. Although I didn't eat here, I did enjoy the bar. And that's about all I can say positive. Now for the not-so-great. When I arrived it was obvious the parking was terrible. I was pleased to have prepaid for parking. I pulled up in front of the hotel, as I usually do when valet parking is offered, and there were not curb-side spots. I double parked and turned on my flashers, waiting for the attendant. The sign says to ask the attendant for parking instructions, but there was no attendant to be found. I waited for nearly 15 minutes before I called the front desk, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes before I hung up. I called back and asked if they could send out a parking attendant. I was advised he was parking cars... it should be noted that not a single car was moved during the 20+ minutes I sat out front, double parked. When the parking attendant came out, he got my name and took my car away; that's all that was said, He didn't even offer to help with my bags. I'm not a fan of tipping parking attendants when the price of parking in the city is so high anyway, but he for sure wasn't getting a tip. When I went in to the desk, there was one young man and he was incredible busy. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the lobby, but the phones were crazy. It took another 15 minutes for me to get checked in because he had to keep putting me on hold to answer the phone. And while he was nice, he was in a lose-lose situation. Not to mention, he had a visible arm tattoo. I have tattoos and I love them, but I felt it was inappropriate for a front desk clerk to have one visible. On an up note, I wasn't aware my rate included SELF-park and not valet. If there had been a parking attendant out front when I arrived, maybe I could have realized this. But the attendant just came to my car, asked my name, and drove away. I was used to this and he didn't ask me if I had valet or self park. When I was checking in, it was discovered that I had used valet services but only paid for self park. The tattooed desk clerk was nice enough to upgrade me at no additional charge for the misunderstanding. When I got in to the elevator, the walls were fabric that was worn and looked very dirty. I'm sure it was clean, but it didn't look like it. On my way to my room, there was a painter in the hall painting the baseboards. He didn't make any effort to move aside, and the hallways are pretty narrow. So I went around. When I arrived in my room, the first thing I noticed was how small the bathroom was. I have a thing for bathrooms, and this was small, cute, and charming. And again, while I'm sure it was clean, there were areas I questioned. The grout in between the little tiles on the floor was dingy and appeared to be dirty. I think this is from lack of maintenance. Also, there was a vertical pipe along the wall; at the base of the pipe there appeared to be something that looked like insulation or something, only it was tattered and painted over; it looked really gross. The wood baseboards were sort of torn up (again, lack of maintenance), but they had been painted over. Newsflash... painting over tattered wood doesn't clean up the look of the wood; it only becomes painted tattered wood. Like the fabric in the elevator, the carpet looked dingy and dirty. The room was small, but sufficient for one person, sorta crowded for two. What really upset me were the window shears. One window was above the air conditioner (which was loud) and when I went over to turn the air on, I noticed black spots at the bottom of the shears. I can only assume this was mold, give the look and the location. Also, the headboard was a padded feaux leather-type material that was all worn and scratched up. Not attractive at all. And while I don't frequent the honor bar items, I had forgotten my tooth brush and craved some saltiness in the middle of the night. Things were expensive, as they go with honor bars, but the products still weren't great quality. It seemed like the entire honor bar was stocked from bulk items from Costco. The noise in the hallway and neighboring rooms was loud for a weeknight; I would imagine a weekend night would be worse. And when I checked out, it took the valet another 15 minutes to bring my car around; there were no other people waiting. When he finally got there with my car, I loaded my luggage, again... he didn't offer to help, and he had the nerve to "linger" as if he was expecting a tip. Sorry, buddy, but I just paid nearly 30 bucks for parking one night; if you wanna tip, you're gonna have to take care of my bags. This was one night; I had a second night scheduled here a few days later. Let's just say, this hotel left an impression on me... one that caused me to call and cancel my second night and rebook at another in the same area. I paid more at my new place, but it was worth it. The moral of the story... when you pay budget, expect a budget product.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR65838138">We were unsure if we should book here because it only had 3 stars on here, but I am so glad that we did. The room was clean, the staff was attentive, friendly and professional. The location was great, quiet and close to many things we were there to see and do. The room was quite small, but we knew to expect that from other reviews, and found it to be very comfortable for our needs. If you're looking for a large spacious suite, look elsewhere, if you're looking for clean, safe and comfortable, it's a great deal for the price!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR64922744">This hotel offered a fine bargain in the heart of Seattle. I had a King corner room which was quite nice. The hotel is older for sure, but the staff was friendly, everything was clean, and it is right in the best part of town. There is a Seattle's Best almost in the hotel lobby which was convenient for a quick breakfast which was great, and you get all this at a much lower price than the typical hotel in this area. My only complaint was that the wireless internet access was slow and unreliable, perhaps because I was on the 6'th floor?<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR64083011">we stayed at this hotel about two weeks ago and booked a queen room through their website for a total of $85 incl. all taxes. the room was not amazing, but clean, good tv, clean bathroom. we were on the 8th floor facing 4th ave. it is fairly noisy but acceptable. it got a bit warmer outside and the air con is dubious so would not recommend a high room when its hot. free use of the small but perfectly adequate fitness room is a plus, the only thing we missed was a fridge. all in all it was a great stay, we could walk to pike place market in about 15 minutes. the internet connection is slow but its free.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR62977821">I had a very bad experience in this hotel. The rooms have very thin walls and you can hear everything from the room next door. There was a constant loud humming machine noise coming from outside. People coming back at night drunk and making noise and partying in the corridors and rooms. I changed rooms twice but they were both equally bad. Eventually I changed to another hotel because I couldn't get a good night's sleep there. I'm not usually very fussy about hotels and I'm used to staying in not so good places but this was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I don't recommend this to anyone who wants a quiet and clean room. Location is good though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR60930217">I found this hotel to be a pretty decent place to stay in downtown Seattle. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the location is absolutely unbeatable. There's a small workout room, it was OK. I especially liked that the hotel is so centralized and close to everything - the stadiums, Pike Place Market, downtown shopping and restaurants, Belltown, nightclubs. We had a room facing over 4th Avenue and it was very quiet at night. However, the hotel is older and not especially fancy. The rooms are small and showing their age, but it was certainly clean. If decor and opulence is a priority, you could opt for the W or Hotel Monaco, which are on the same block -- and probably 2 to 3 times more expensive. For the price and convenience, however, it's a good deal.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR59173153">This is a fine place to stay in downtown Seattle. The room and bathroom were quite small but very functional. Things were a bit worn but still clean. Its an older building so the tub drained a little slow but the there were enough towels and it had a window that opened to let in fresh air. The bed was comfortable and the staff were friendly enough. Little touches like fresh apples in the lobby and wireless Internet for guests was appreciated. If you are looking to spend a lot of time in your hotel room you might find it a bit cramped but if you're looking for a clean and safe place to sleep when you are out exploring the city, it is great. It is not a fancy hotel but then you are not paying those prices either.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR55728248">We recently stayed at the Executive Hotel during a quick weekend getaway....aka so my girlfriend could go shopping. I have stayed at a number of hotels in the Seattle area and consistently come back here because of the overall value. The location is awesome, only a few blocks from main shopping areas and within walking distance to Qwest Field, (Seahawks) or Safeco Field, (Mariners). The staff is friendly, the wifi is free and there is a Seattle's Best Coffee shop on the lobby floor. Our room has always been clean and the noise has never been an issue. The only reason not to stay here is because they are sold out.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53127302">Came to Seattle for a weekend with my mother and four year old son from Portland. It is but a five dollar cab ride from the train depot. Excellent. Although the hotel building is old and a bit shabby, our double queen room was clean and cozy. (We had booked a Cozy Double, but asked for the listed complimentary upgrade when available.) The shower head was nice and the room was comfortable for the three of us. This was my sons first time in a hotel and he had a blast! The in room coffee was delicious and strong and the folks at the Seattle's Best shop downstairs gladly gave me half and half to bring up to our room. The location is AWESOME!!! Very easy walking distance to Market, International Dist, Monorail to Seattle Center, and right across the street from the beautiful downtown library. We had a great time and my husband and I have book a room for our anniversary weekend in early February. And one last thing...about a block and a half away there is the very delicious Sweet Iron Waffles. Be sure to go there for an AMAZING six dollar breakfast!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR52722615">We stayed overnight to see the last seahawks game of the year.So was not sure what to expect. I must say i was presently surprised. The location was great..right close to both Pikes Market and Qwest and Safeco Fields. All three within walking distance. Sure the room was a bit on the small size,but i am not spending all my time in the room so the size was not an issue. The cost is reasonable and i guess it is you get what you pay for. The Bathroom was clean and the shower had good pressure and the water got hot right away. We had a king size bed in our room and it was very comfortable with a nice thick duvet. The TV is a nice size and flat screen which was nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were craving Chinese food so called down to the front desk and asked if there was any in delivery distance. The clerk not only let us know which ones but helped out by giving us menus as well. If you are looking for good location and good value and a comfy stay i would recommend this place. I am going to stay again the next time i am in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR47775487">A small, basic but well-run business hotel. The standard room is just big enough for one person. But the room is clean and pleasant, the bed was great --pillows too- and the large flat showerhead feels like a gentle rain. Nice large-screen TV, AC/heat worked great. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Locale was very convenient for my purposes --close to the conference I was attending (but MANY dollars cheaper) and in a safe area so I walked back and forth daily. Also an easy walk to the Pike Place market and the historic district. A good and much lass expensive option for a business traveler. But be forewarned -- no restaurant in the hotel --however, a coffee store on the main level offers breakfast sandwiches as well as Seattle's Best Coffee (think that was the name of it.)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR46705220">Terrible, dumpy old hotel. Worst hotel stay of my life, and I've had some doozies in my hosteling years. In a bid to save money the management had shut off the AC for the season and the rooms were stifling. The front desk told us to open a window. Thanks, Einstein! I had to roll up a magazine to prop the window open. Still stifling. We tried wedging something under a hall door to the outside stairwell to try to create a draft. I spent most of one night trying to sleep in the lobby because it wasn't as hot as my room until the night clerk made me go back to my room. The bathroom was so tiny you couldn't sit squarely on the biffy because of the toilet roll dispenser being in the way. The trim around the floor was coming away from the wall. paint is peeling everywhere outside. The carpeting looks filthy. Good location downtown and the SBC was handy, but that's about all. They have WiFi which is nice but nowhere in the rooms to sit a laptop - except on your actual lap. Avoid!!<topic>none</topic>

There is lots of shopping close by and plenty of restaurants for any taste. We took advantage of the hotel's valet parking whilw we were there and unfortunately our vehicle was broken into.

<comment category="negative" id="UR46250736">I stayed at this hotel twice in September, 2009. The first time I was charged about $150/night. The second time $71/night. The $71 rate is about what this hotel is worth. The location is great if you're a business traveler, or even for most tourists. It's a little off the shopping drag, but centrally located if you're also going to visit the aquarium, Chinatown, Pioneer Square, and the other things there are to do in Seattle. But the hotel, itself isn't great. It's like it was a crappy hotel that someone really wanted to upgrade, but only just started before having to stop. Certain things don't go together. Flat screen TVs: good. Peeling paint: bad. Internet access: good. Carpet stains: bad. I would stay here again if I was a single business traveler trying to save a buck. Would I bring my wife here? Heck, no! Not that it's not safe. But much of the hotel is simply worn out. Housekeeping tries really hard to fight back against the grime and does an admirable job. But you can only hold back the tide of funk for so long. There's a great Seattle's Best attached to the lobby, and a Starbucks across the street. Free wifi at Seattle's Best and throughout the hotel. Starbucks wifi is free if you have AT&amp;T DSL service or an iPhone. One note for anyone who has difficulty getting around -- avoid this hotel. You must navigate a set of stairs to get from any of the entrances to the elevators. Here's a helpful hint for those who stay, though -- it's easier to thump your suitcases down the stairs from the mezzanine level to the entrance than it is to drag them up the stairs from the lobby level to the entrance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR45851116">Stayed at this hotel for 1 night, booked for 2 but decided to leave a day early. Our room was a "cozy double" and it sure was cozy! VERY small room, some newish furniture but the building is aged. The headboards were quite worn out and the bathroom was something else. Had to shower leaning back as the shower head looked me right in the face, and I'm only 5'7". Let's just say the bathroom was so small that the shelf for the towels was inside the shower. The elevators were pretty scary, had to stop and wait after the doors had opened for it to adjust so it was level with the ground! The walls are paper thin, could hear every detail of the conversation the neighbors were having at 2am, and even with the windows shut, could hear men fighting out side around the same time. The room was clean though, no question about it, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was crappy though, had to truck our luggage around the corner to the parkade, up some stairs, to get to the elevator to take us up to our car.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR41548066">The room, though small, met all our needs. It was clean and crisp and our corner room was nice with two sets of windows. Being from the country we enjoyed the hustle and bustle out the windows. Our room, 210, was quiet and the bed and pillows were awesome. We both slept well and enjoyed our time with pleasant, efficient staff and the Seattle's Best on the corner. The valet parking was well worth the extra bucks and was so convenient. Don't miss the Seattle Library next door. Take a tour! This hotel was only one block from the office where my meeting was, so that was very nice. I would certainly stay here again. Seattle has many hotels, most of which are high in price. This hotel offers a reasonable alternative. Don't underestimate it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR38825909">Friendly, helpful staff welcome you to this older downtown hotel. We booked the cozy Queen which included Valet Parking and continental breakfast. Upon arrival we were given an upgrade. The bathrooms are period, clean and tiny. The closet is also tiny so don't expect to hang a lot of clothing. The air conditioner in our room didn't work that well-but no matter weather had started cooling down in late August. The bed is a little on the soft side but some people like that. The continental breakfast served by very friendly people in the lobby coffee shop was fine-coffee or tea, juice and your choice of pastry. Newspapers were available in the lounge. Try and not get a room near the ancient elevators-they are very noisy. This hotel was great for a two day visit to Seattle. The location is excellent as you can walk to the Public Market, the Space Needle the water front areas and to the major department stores. Seattle is a great city- The Executive Hotel Pacific will serve you very well indeed for a short stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR37389907">this was absolutely my worst hotel experience ever. i don't even know were to begin. the rooms were old and disgusting i felt like bugs were going to crawl out of the cracks in the walls. we were lucky enough to get the room next to the ancient elevator which sounded like a locomotive going all night long. when we called to ask if we could be moved as it was impossible to sleep with the noise the staff was very rude and would not move us. when it was time to check out i called to have our car brought around by the valet which cost $37 15 minutes before heading down to check out, we were told we only needed to call 5 minutes in advance. once we got down and waited outside for another 10 minutes my boyfriend decided to go in and check what was going on, they said the car is on the way. 5 minutes later still no car. we went back into check and discovered nobody every even went to get out car. finally the valet came out and couldn't even find where our car was parked. the entire experience was just awful.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR37319531">We stayed for three nights. On the plus side, this hotel is in a great central location in downtown Seattle; the new main library is right across the street and plenty of stores and services are within walking distance, so you do not need to rent a car. It's an old building with character, something that's hard to find these days. The price that we got was very reasonable too. The staff was very friendly and helpful and attentive to our needs; a special thanks to the very friendly doorman, Stanley. On the negative side, our room was rather small and so could not include a desk and chair. The window needed to be washed and some of the furniture is approaching the time when it needs to be replaced. The tub drain was extremely slow. Like a lot of hotels, the walls were too thin, but our neighbors quieted down, so we did not have to complain about it. The biggest negative for us was the fact that the elevator lobby is not level with the street, so if you have mobility problems or require a wheelchair, this is not the hotel for the disabled. But, we managed fine in spite of it. It is quite a hike up to the hotel from the waterfront--not for the out-of-shape!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR35955885">I cannot even on the rooms as I didn't even get that far. We arrived at 11:00 on a Saturday night--tired and anxious to crash. We dragged in 2 huge bags and no one offered to help. We checked in only to be told there was a flood in "our room" and they are sorry there are no other rooms available. They had both of our cell phone numbers but did not feel the need to notify us. They "don't call their guests" was their reply. Instead they booked us at a Holiday Inn Express 10 MILES FROM SEATTLE!!! We were told there were "no rooms available in Seattle for the night". Calling the staff miserable, uninterested and pathetic is an understatement. They basically shrugged their shoulders, huffed and puffed and seemed bothered simply by our presence. I've never experienced anything like it. TOTAL DUMP. In the end there "were rooms available in Seattle" and it all worked out elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR34494472">For the pricing of this hotel you may very well expect to find a pool, spa, "nice" weight room and all of the goodies you would want. In this hotel almost nothing is provided for you. The rooms are cramped and honestly being a larger sized person not in girth but in height I wasn't sure if I could even fit. The shower was atrocious for me mainly because the shower-head was chest level for goodness sake and wasn't adjustable. The parking was terrible mainly because there was very little in the way of that. The hotel provided maybe 6 parking spots for 9 floors of guests. NOT WORTH IT. I was staying on the fifth floor and lemme tell you waiting for the elevator was terrible it must have been built in the 1960's or something but it ran....very slowly and I was always worried about the thing because it creaked when you went up or down in it. The weight room they provide isn't even a weight room....actually unless you are told where the heck it is you won't even be able to find it. I overheard the front desk person say it was on the second floor but i went to check where it was and all i found were hotel rooms. My uncle and I stayed there for I believe 3-4 days and on the very first night my card key STOPPED WORKING!!!! I went down to the lobby the next day which is probably the smallest lobby I have EVER seen in my life! and told the lady that my key had stopped working and asked if she could extend it for the rest of my stay. This girl was the one who had checked us in not 24 hours before and she couldn't remember me. Its a hard job I know but come on! My uncle was out walking around and I couldn't get him to VERIFY that i was in the room with him so she quizzed me about him, then I had to give her my ID, and finally got my key working again. The coffee shop attached to the hotel was nice and I really liked it. Other than that the hotel was mediocre at best and I probably will never stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33223309">I stayed here with my daughter and two sons, my daughter had to attend a conference in Seattle and it was all booked very last minute. After reading some of the the reviews of this hotel I was very apprehensive to say the least however I was pleasantly surprised with the place. Yes there are posher more up to date places but if you want them then you have to pay. We had the complementary buffet breakfast which is served in the very busy coffee shop downstairs and you are entitled to a pastry, bottle of juice and hot drink which was fine for us but there are plenty of places to eat in the area if you didn't want to go for this option. The rooms are small but clean and have all you need. You can have a long wait for the lifts as the hotel was very busy with all types of traveller. There is a comfortable lounge with internet access although if you want to use the computer you may have a wait, but there is a huge beautiful library over the road with computers aplenty. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful and if I am ever fortunate enough to return to Seattle I wouldn't hesitate to use this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

While the hotel is clean, rooms are quite small, and apart from wireless internet, there isn't much that stands out. Desk staff don't seem particularly enthusiastic about their work, and the hotel is a little old fashioned in places (bathrooms for example).

<comment category="negative" id="UR30824572">My work booked me and a colleague into this hotel, and I tried to change after I had read the tripadvisor reviews...but for various reasons this proved impractical, and so we stayed here for 5 nights in May. Beautiful weather (surprisingly), and a fabulous location for the work I was doing, but the hotel lurched between quirky and decrepit (and occasionally sullenly incompetent) depending on my mood... The entrance area is split across three levels, which require either a downstairs drag or an upstairs hike with your luggage (the porter can be seen running away into the left luggage room as you approach). The reception is polite but unhelpful as they don't really cater for the sort of needs travellers may have (Power adapter? No. Stamps? Of course not). They issue two room cards despite there being only me, and they had actually booked out four rooms for a total of 16 nights for us (though this may not be their fault). The rooms are definitely small, especially by American standards, but would it really have hurt to provide a suitcase stand to help out with the squeeze? The bathroom was a very tight fit (and I am tall and felt I had to concertina up to sit down), but more or less functional. The 'robe' provided would barely have covered my modesty if I could have got it around my shoulders (more like a souvenir tea towel), and I wonder if this is a favourite trick of hotels to save themselves doing a bit of laundry. Did they not notice they had put a size 0 robe in a big man's room? Had a great view of the Koolhuis Library next door, and was across the hall from the very small 'Cardio Room' that has one running machine, one cross trainer and one stationary bike, as well as the ubiquitous television set that Americans can't seem to operate without. Free WiFi didn't function for most of my stay. Had a couple of drinks in the downstairs bar, but having to call the lift and struggle with its doors (both opening and closing) is a bit ridiculous when you are only on the second floor. The internal decor of Jasmine's bar is for seventies glam nostalgics only, and if you were there then, it is likely that if you left anything tucked under the sofas it is probably still there. American service always amuses me because they promise so much (and so cheerfully) and delivers so little (with serious expressions that suggest the end of the world could not be put off quite long enough to do you the service they said they would). In general, despite an apparently recent multi-milllion pound refit, this place gives the impression of a run down flop house, with a blind interior decorator getting the gig. It doesn't need to be this way, and the management should get their act together, especially considering the quality of the local competition.<topic>none</topic>

Across the street from the Main Public Library which is an architectural gem and within walking distance of Pike Place Market and a lot of other attractions.

<comment category="negative" id="UR26036243">Not even sure where to start...there were so many disappointing things. The description of the hotel read "boutique" and it is the farthest thing from that. I felt as though I was in Europe again staying in a hostel. The walls are paper thin!!!!! The bathroom was so small, that I could not set any of my toiletries even in the bathroom. Unable to close the toilet seat due to the handle being in the way....great engineering and planning! The biggest thing was the constant cigarette smoke that seeped into our room from the hallway and room next door. After putting up with this two nights in a row, we finally moved to a different room on another floor...only to have the door handle fall off right in our hands!!! I have to say I was disappointed in the way the hotel handled our disappointments. They didn't even comp us one night!!! Never again!!!!<topic>none</topic>

The a/c did not work and we had to prop the window with a sturdy book. The window was very heavy. I noticed other patrons were creative in their window-propping; a wooden coat-hanger for example. The bathrooms were nice with marble vanity etc. Other reviews complained of the smallness of the bathrooms, but we found this to be okay. Clean with good soaps, shampoos. Easy walk to Underground Tour and Pike's Market. Staff were real nice and let us check in early on a rainy day. The airport bus (Grey Line) shuttled right around the corner which was very convenient.

<comment category="negative" id="UR20446140">We stayed here because it was part of a block booking for a conference. Our experiences were similar to those of other reviewers, i.e. small rooms with dreary decor, mostly indifferent front-desk service, and noisy (very noisy if, like us, you get an inward-facing room overlooking the kitchen air con units!). On the positive side, the tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the shower was excellent. Plus the bed was really comfortable. Yes, the hotel is in a reasonably convenient downtown location, but that barely makes up for the downsides. If like us you simply need a place to put your head down for the night, and are likely to spend the rest of your time out and about in Seattle, then this modestly-priced hotel should suffice for a few nights. But there aren't enough creature comforts to make you want to stick around and relax in it during the day or evening. After 5 nights we were certainly glad to be moving on.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20356370">I stayed in this hotel, with a friend, over the weekend of the 19th-21st September. I had stayed there before and recommended my friend book on the basis of my last stay, which was reasonable. But that was definitely not the case this time around. There were so many disappointing things about our weekend at the Executuve Hotel Pacific........ 1.We were placed in a room directly opposite the elevators on the 5th floor. The noise from the elevators and other guests returning home until the early hours of the morning was very loud (and i am usually a heavy sleeper, and i could still hear it clearly , on and off, throughout the night). Also the cleaning staff made such a racket in the morning it was difficult to sleep past 7am. 2.We made a specific online request to have a small fridge in the room for medications. This was obviously ignored online, as were our pleas to have something done about it when we checked in. Previously, in other similar hotels, we were offered a small portable fridge/cooler for the exact same purpose. 3. The air conditioning did "work" (ie turn on) but produced a worrying, burning smell when it was turned on (as if it had not been used for weeks). So we tried to open the window which was stuck down, so we could only open in a few cm to try and let some cool, fresh air into the now stuffy room. 4. The bathroom was small, but the size itself wasn't the main issue. The shower head had virtually no pressure and the toilet was VERY, VERY noisy every time we flushed (and we could hear the toilets of adjacent rooms quite clearly too). Very old, poor plumbing. 5. When we suggested to the front desk staff that they should move us because of all of the above reasons, they said they were fully booked for our first night but could change our rooms for the second night. We agreed. When we presented to the front desk for our new room the next day, the new staff member stated nothing had been documented in their book about a room change, and again they were booked out so they could not help us. In fact, they freely admitted that they had just used up the last room for the guest who checked in minutes before, and they had overbooked...so they still had to find rooms for 4 guests who had yet to check-in. Not something that i imagine a reputable hotel does(or admits to their other guests!). So all up, we were glad to check-out and will not be returning to this hotel. Next time we will gladly pay a few extra dollars for a decent hotel room and some service!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20254927">I was very disappointed with my stay at this hotel. When I booked I let them know that it was for a Bridal Shower from 6pm-11pm and asked if they had any restrictions, quiet hours, etc. They said "no" and that it would be just fine, so I booked (2) rooms. Upon arriving and checking into our rooms we noticed that we could hear every word said next door...the walls were paper thin! Noise was a definite problem and I would not have booked here if they had been honest with me as I had been with them about the purpose of our stay. They could have done so much to avoid the situation by putting us in a corner or end room as I book (2) suites! I talked to a hotel representative letting her know my disappointment since I had arranged this ahead of time but also my understanding of other guests since the hotel did not plan well and asked it we could be moved, etc. She responded very annoyed and was not open to any resolution besides us going to sleep....it was around 9:50pm on a Saturday night and we had about an hour left of our shower. To make matters worse both rooms that we stayed in were prank called. From 1am-3am the phones would ring and when we would answer it was just hold music. These calls could not have come from guest rooms (we tried calling each other) as the guest room phones did not have a hold button. It got so bad that we had to unplug the phones but needless to say that we did not get any sleep. When I asked at checkout if they had been having any troubles with their phones they said they were working just fine. Granted I have no proof that the hotel made these calls, but it seems very unlikely that both our rooms would have this problem and that hold music would be in the back ground. Also, the next morning at 9:15am a maid banged on our door asking when we were leaving....check out wasn't until 11am. Overall if you want to pay $250 for a place to sleep where there is no customer service what so ever, then this is the hotel for you. Otherwise I recommend staying away and spending your money where you will be taken care of properly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20175021">We recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip. Overall, the hotel was just alright, as the location is fairly convenient, but after saying that, if you find any hotel in the downtown area, it will be convenient. The hotel is clean, the staff is pretty friendly, and the rooms are very small, especially the bathroom, which was terribly small. Our air conditioning unit wasn't barely working and it was pretty loud at night. The elevators are very slow as well. I am not sure if there is free wireless internet service but there is one computer for public use. Anyway, if the was price is right, i'd stay there again but this wouldn't be my first choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19345431">I'm not sure whether to recommend this hotel for the great "old" feel and comfy beds, or to not recommend it for the terrible service of the front desk staff and the dirty appearance of the bathroom. My husband and I stayed here over the weekend and found that the location of the hotel is wonderful, if not perfect. The condition of the hotel is, however, far from perfect. The headboards had tears in them, the bathroom was less than sanitary feeling, the room was rather small, and the paint was coming off of the baseboards in places. I feel like there were cosmetic changes that could have been made to make the room more appealing without spending a lot of money on the part of the hotel. Nonetheless, the beds were great, the tv was nice and conveniently placed, and the feel was nothing less than hisotric Seattle. If you are expecting something breathtaking I don't recommend this hotel. If you simly need somewhere to stay- this will suit you fine!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19177818">I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend at the time for 2 nights on Valentines Day, it was okay, but INCREDIBLY overpriced for what you get. You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room next door, all night we could hear the couple next door having sex, it was horrible. I accidently left a dress still with tag on in the closet and when I called the next day to have them hold it for me, they said it was no longer there and housekeeping checked the closet and never found it...liars and thieves!!! Also, I needed to get my cell phone which I left in my car, the valet service offered to go get it, which was VERY nice, HOWEVER, the guy left my light on and caused my battery to die, which in turn took the valet 30 minutes to get my car once we needed it in the morning. I would DEFINETLY stay somewhere else and not waste my money here....ps bathrooms crappy!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19117459">The room was tiny. It barely accommodated the two uncomfortable double beds. The bathroom was also very small, almost no vanity space. There are two vending/ice areas, on the 5th and 7th floors. We were on the second floor. Definately NOT worth the sticker price!!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19029974">We stayed here from Aug. 13 to 16, 2008 and was given the third room from the elevators on the 7th floor. On the whole, the stay was OK and I would come back again. That said, there are things which irked me and could/needs to be improved for sure. Rooms: Clean, older, and pretty small. Best suited for a couple. Bathroom: Very small (probably the smallest sink I have ever encountered). but clean. On the plus side, the shower heads worked well and there were no mould or cracks. On the minus side, there is very little counter space and I can see the bathroom being a tight squeeze for larger individuals (I'm pretty tiny at 5 feet 2 and 115 lbs) Noise: The walls are very thin indeed - we had a baby next door and heard it crying into the night. If you are lucky enough to have quiet neighbours, then things should be OK. We could also hear the hum of the elevators (this is not constant, but occasional), but this did not bother us too much (if you can sleep through the hum of an airconditioner for example, then it should not be no problem). Amenities: Room had a good size TV and a clock radio which you could plug your Ipod into. There's free wireless Internet in rooms (a computer is also available in the sitting/lobby area for those without personal laptops). There is a cardio room and Seattle's Best Coffee outlet just downstairs connected to the hotel. Location: Fabulous and very central to Pioneer Square, Pine/Pike Street, Waterfront, Chinatown, Pike Place - all within walking distance. Please also check out the modern Seattle Public Library building across the street - not listed in any tourist guide, but absolutely beautiful - go to the third and 10th floors in particular. Hotel: Lobby areas are nice, although external looks old. Valet Parking: $19 per day (not including taxes) Overall, our stay was good. I was very wary at first and nearly did not book this hotel after reading reviews (I'm pretty particularly about cleanliness and location), but can't complain too much having stayed there for three nights.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18744321">we stayed in the hotel while we had four days in Seattle between July 25 and July 29. It was the only one available when we booked through United vacations. Other unavailable possibilities are located close by. My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the "Tower of Terror" ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift. The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere. You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel. There are some good restaurants within two or three blocks, because the hotel only has a coffee shop. We fell in lucky, we were in Seattle on the night of the excellent Torchlight procession (unintentionally). There's 900,000 people live in Seattle, and half of them must have been in the procession! The people are nice and friendly, the trips we had were excellent, but the next time we go to Seattle, we won't be staying at the Exec Pacific -- unless the owners put their hands in their pockets and pay for a much needed major refurbishment. It's a waste of an excellent location in a friendly city.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18439082">Read the majority of the negative comments that shold tell you something. Its a early 1900 building that had some new carpet, and some marble in the front entrance and there you are. There is NO access for a whhelchair. You park out front and load your luggage in the hotel taking it down some stairs a placing it on a cart and hoping on an old clanky elevator. Once your done, you have to drive the car to a public parkade in the next building over. Its unfornate that you can not drive under the building and unload the car and have an elevator take you to your floor. The bathroom was smaller than small, the rooms we tiny, and carpet had a stain, and an electrical wire that was sheathed and screwed to the wall came off the wall. The door to the room had a deadbolt (thankfully), however, the old style manual slider lock with a chained piece that was connected to the wall was broken off and made me wonder if this room was recently broken into? The building should be knocked down and a new one constructed. Anyhow, its not worth what we paid. Its in an okay location, but in my opinion is a 2 star hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18288458">Here it is- the definitive evidence to illustrate how small the rooms are at The Executive Hotel- see pics The bathroom does not hold my personal travel trophy for tiny but it is small and if you are pressed for time then while you are on the 'throne' you could soak your feet at the same time. The room is small too but fine for two people. I only bristle at the $196.00 price per night when I glance up and see huge cracks that cut across the length of the ceiling as well as water stains and peeling paint. My prayer before falling asleep- Oh Lord please may there not be an earthquake tonight!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR17029311">Got a very reasonable price...at least $50 less per night than the best deal I could find on Expedia. It's an older, refurbished hotel so, yes, the rooms are small, but they're livable. Plus there's an open "living room" area on the Mezzine that has free wi-fi, so if you do need room to stretch you can do it there. The bed was very comfortable and I found the rooms and hallways to be very quiet. I think the older construction actually helps in this case. Unlike the newer hotels that are basically metal and cinder block, the Hotel Pacific actually seems to have thick insulated walls. It's also within good walking distance of shopping and Pike's Market. I was in town for a conference and it was about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center. The drawbacks? A crotchety elevator that stopped working once or twice and the hotel could use a good scrubbing from top to bottom. While the rooms were generally clean (the curtain sheers could use a washing) I'm currently looking at a visible layer of dust on the light fixtures in the hotel lobby. Not a deal breaker but they should break out a ladder and take care of details like that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16950722">we had a quick one night stopover in seattle on our way to vancouver. we chose this hotel as it was recommended in lonely planet. GOD NO! the rooms were TINY, and the walls paper thin, with lots of strange characters coming and going at all hours. we asked to be moved from our initial room (with a great view of car park) as there was the constant sound of a baby crying. our second room (same size, even better view of car park) was even noisier, and we were kept up all night by people in the room next door having very loud and vocal sex. if you want to sleep in seattle, this is not the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16077844">We picked this hotel based on the pictures and the price on Expedia. The rack rate charged by the hotel is insane considering I could have gotten a decent motel/lodge for half the price. The room that was given to us was about 12'x9'. 12x9 doesn't sound too bad but put a queen sized bed, two end tables, a dresser/tv stand, and a lounge seat and you don't have enough roomm to breathe! The bathroom is no different. Good luck sitting on the toilelt. You need to be aware of surroundings. As soon as you sit down and sit upright, you feel a sharp pain as the bathroom sink enbed's inteself into your left shoulder blade! I would recommend using priceline or whatever else you can to go for a better hotel. If you want to save money, stay out of downtown and def. stay away from this hotel. It is renovated but they didn't spend a lot of effort on it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15695245">Didn't expect a lot from Executive for the price, CAD $115/nt. Was an overnighter but longer stays might want to consider other alternatives it can be noisy for light sleepers. Walls are pretty thin and it is an old hotel after all. Location is quite central and about 10 min away to Pike Place. Another 15 min to Chinatown. And under 10 min away to downtown shopping. Space Needle area will require a cab, but monorail is walking distance. The funky Capitol Hill shouldn't be more than 10 min drive away and some consider it even a walking distance. Parking was included and is in parkade in the building next door. Internet consisted of one computer and getting the chance to get on it is hit and miss... more likely 'miss' unless you get up nice and early. This being Seattle, there was a Starbucks across the street and Seattle's Best Coffee right in the lobby. Overall good value.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15622488">I have stayed in far better places in Seattle for less. Room was the size of a prison cell, with a window facing a outside wall. It was quiet until someone showered or flushed a toilet. On the plus side a Seattle Best Coffee is next to the lobby and it is right downtown. If you take the hotel's limo expect to pay at least 30% more than a yellow cab. Hotel staff are helpful and friendly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15000996">When I walked into the lobby of the Executive Pacific in Seattle, it was filled with young "hipsters" with ear plates and nose rings and tattoos - yawn - hey, youngsters, as an ex punk-rocker, you should know that all that nonsense hasn't really been "shocking" since the '80s. Don't worry - we see you. When I saw my room, now THAT was the shocker - old, run down, and most importantly, DIRTY. The grout between the tiles on the bathroom floor was black and mucky. The floor of the shower was filthy with "foot dirt". Even the robe hanging in the closet had STAINS running down the front of it! They should be embarrassed at the lack of hygiene in this place - maybe it's "alternative" to sleep in a filthy bed, but back in the '80s we did that for free, not for $150 a night. I complained at the front desk and was shown an "upgrade" room which was much bigger, but also had a dirty tub, and a filthy bathroom floor. When I pointed this out to the bellman, he said "Well, it's an old building." Pointing to some RECENT black fingerprint smudges on the closet door, I said, "Lots of buildings are old - this is a DIRTY building - I could take that off right now with some 409." I got out of there ASAP and found a CLEAN, big room in nearby Issaquah where the walls are thick enough that I don't have to hear my next door neighbor using the toilet (sorry to be gross). AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THEY SANDBLAST THE GRIME.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR14298817">I was booked in this hotel by a company recruiter and was appalled by the condition of this hotel. I did not mind the room being small but the fact that the carpet was filthy, the dark layer of scum in the bathtub, the mold on the bathroom ceiling, peeling wallpaper, and blackened windows was enough to make me rate this place "terrible". I would never stay at any of these establishments again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. The staff was friendly but when I asked if there was a room that had possibly been renovated more recently I was told they were all done at the same time. Fortunately, I was there for two nights.

<comment category="negative" id="UR14158370">The hotel is located conveniently in downtown Seattle close to the convention center. That description matches quite some others far more recently built ones, but they also go along with a higher price tag. There is no breakfast other than visiting Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby serving great lattes and some muffins. For a small bite enough, but that's it. The room was clean and primarily filled with the queen-size bed. The bathroom was tiny. Fine if all you want is sleep after a busy day, but certainly no retreat.<topic>none</topic>

I requested a room away from the elevator, and we were right next to the elevator. The "newly renovated" rooms had dirty, dingy floors, the wall paper on the walls was pealing and scatched up, and there was a hole in the wall that had been covered up by a piece of wall paper... they didn't even bother to fill it!

I am actually from a suburb of Bellevue but stayed here with my boyfriend to go to Bumbershoot. There are bus stops everywhere within the one-block circumference of this hotel. Or maybe that's just Seattle's awesome public transportation system. Anyway, the service was also spectacular. The front-desk lady knew EVERYTHING about Seattle and how to get around. Free wireless Internet is also a huge bonus! The room was a little small, but there were only two of us staying there and we like to be close. But for those of you who need space, you may want to go for one of those hotel chain suites. The SBC in the lobby was also super convenient and perfect for breakfast. Oh!

<comment category="negative" id="UR12667766">The absolute only thing this hotel has going for it is its location- right in the downtown core. Upon check-in, we were advised that parking would be an additional charge of $19/day. We were then given a "superior" room on the top floor and were greeted by a cracked and peeling ceiling, dirty walls and baseboards, and a run down bathroom. We complained to the front desk and were able to switch rooms. The only improvement in the second room was that there was actually a dresser and the ceiling was in better shape. But we took it. Let me restate, the bathroom alone is reason not to stay at this hotel. All of the fixtures were ancient, despite the sites' claims of a recent renovation. The tile was also old and the grout stained. The toilet flush, I'm sure, could be heard two rooms down on either side- it was seriously THAT loud. Plus, it was so small you couldn't close the door until you were actually sitting on the toilet. The counter space (or lack there-of) did not have sufficient space for my make-up bag, and it's hardly a suitcase. The walls were thin and we could easily hear conversations next door, along with our neighbors own plumbing issues. The radiator was not working which sucked because the building was freezing cold. One last thing: this hotel is definitely not handicapped friendly. There are stairs leading from the front desk to the elevator. I'm not handicapped, but it was hard dragging my luggage up a flight of stairs. Because my husband and I were so disappointed, we left a day early and drove back home to Vancouver, BC. Thank you, hotels.ca, for the apology and refund!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10994164">I love old buildings and old hotels. Our room was in the corner on the top floor. We are directly across from the fabulous Seattle Public Library, which is a must see. The room is perfectly small and the bathroom is great. We love the old, deep porcelain bathtub with endless hot water. This alone makes me love my room. The one-piece modern sink is stunning and now, I know, I must have one of my own. We walked here from the ferry on Thanksgiving. FYI: If I'd known, I'd choose to go straight up the hill to third or fourth avenue and walk downtown to the hotel that way. I had my young daughter with me and we ended up walking a gauntlet of single, homeless or illegal, men sitting on the pier near the marketplace. It was uncomfortable for both of us, especially pulling our luggage along. It wasn't the highest vibration for sure. In addition, we ate a great Thanksgiving buffet dinner across the street at the Sazerac Restaurant located in the Hotel Monaco. Delicious! It was a lovely way to spend the holiday, for certain. If you like the energy and ambience of old hotels and adore hot baths and excellent customer service then stay at the Executive Hotel Pacific in downtown Seattle.

<comment category="negative" id="UR10966364">I was in Seattle for a large conference. Unfortunately, by the time I booked a hotel room all the major hotels near the convention center had no vacancies. The Executive Pacific was the only thing in the vicinity. It was a just a brisk 10-minute walk to the convention center, which I rather enjoyed. Also, on the positive side, there's a good coffee shop (Seattle's Best) right in the hotel. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable. Front desk service was prompt and polite. On the downside, the room was extremely small, not that this fact mattered in my case. The website boasts a 'cardio room,' which is nothing more than three machines (an almost kaput treadmill, bike, and cross-trainer).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10962364">The hotel is in a great location that was within walking distance to everything! Great shopping, pike market, good restaurants, and the waterfront. Also the area was very safe! We walked around at night with no worries!The hotel is also in the free transit zone, so you can take a bus around downtown for free! We got the queen superior room, and although it wasn't huge it comfortably fit two people and two large suitcases. The rooms were clean and the beds were VERY comfy! The only complaints are that the walls were thin and the elevator was loud. We could hear the people in the room next to us in the morning, but that was manageable. Our room was right across the hall from the elevator, but once we fell asleep you didn't hear it, and the hotel didn't attract a crowd of young partiers who came in really late at night. The staff at check-in (9:00pm) at the front desk, weren't that pleasant, and kind of rude, but the rest of the staff for the remainder of our trip was very cheerful and helpful. A big plus of the hotel is that they held our luggage for the day after we checked out, until we left for the airport, for free! Seattle's Best Coffee in the hotel was great! It made the whole hotel smell wonderful in the morning, and was a great way to get the morning started! The restaurant in the hotel was very good. The sushi was amazing! other great restaurants were steamers which is right on the waterfront, and shuckers which is in the Fairmont Olympic next door. Both of these restaurants had 2-for-1 coupons in the entertainment book, which was an added bonus on top of the amazing food! Although the hotel isn't a stop on any of the airport shuttles, Grayline Shuttle stops at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel, which is not even half a block away! you can pay an extra $5 to get dropped off at the door of the hotel, but you can easily walk from the Fairmont. Also Grayline was alot cheaper than a taxi, and came every 15 minutes which was very convient! All in all the hotel was excellent for the amount that we paid! We were on a tight budget, but wanted to stay somewhere that was clean and comfy and in a safe area, and the Executive Pacific provided everything that we could have wanted! We would definately stay here again, and recommend it to everyone!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR10796160">This was an overall great experience. I became discouraged when reading the other reviews, but I believe some were a bit unfair. If you are going to this hotel expecting it to be a 5-star resort, you will be disappointed. I went with my boyfriend from the 10th-12th, and I had an AMAZING stay. Check in was fast, no room mix ups, and it has a very convenient parking garage right next door for only 19$ a night, and you can come and go as you please. We stayed in 402, and it had a terrible view of the backside of the parking garage and the hotel generator, but we didn't get a room for the view. (Hopefully if you are going to Seattle you're not planning on staying in the whole time! That's not what this hotel is for!) WHITE GOOSE-DOWN COMFORTERS. Very clean room, comfortable bed. Flat screen panel TV of good size. We had to call the maintenence man to fix the toilet, but other than that no complications. The hotel is charming, a cute little coffee hosue down stairs, but very thin walls. You can hear a lot, so try to get a room away from the elevators, and we brough a portable DVD player and some movies for at night to help drown out the noise. PERFECT location. 6 blocks away from the mall where you can catch the monorail for 2 bucks and get to the City center/space needle/EMP museum in NO time at all. Only a short, downhill hike to Pike's and the waterfront. For it's location, price, and comfort, it is a steal. I would recommend this hotel if you are easy going and not expecting a 5 star spa. It was perfect for the weekend getaway.<topic>none</topic>

Unusually efficient desk made check-in and check-out a breeze. Two problems: 1. The two elevators are slow so wait times can be significant. 2.

<comment category="negative" id="UR8838962">Hotel was well located. Rooms quite cozy and a comfy bed. Bathroom was fine, but as others have said...the toilet flush is really noisy and likely to wake up 'the other half' in the middle of the night. We did find that the door to the adjcent room was really thin, so got disturbed one night by next door's antics, but a quick phone call to reception at 3am and it was soon sorted. The only real grip I had was the attitude of the reception desk manager (whose name I forget) but had the charm of a brick. He was neither welcoming or terribly polite and, having just arrived in Seattle from Vancouver, I was shocked and disappointed at the welcome to the city. My tip to the hotel management would be to send this guy on a charm course...or maybe just get somebody else in. Other than that, an OK hotel in a convenient part of town. Cheers!<topic>none</topic>

Our room was match box tiny, you couldn't even breathe, though that was expected because we only paid $120 per night for the room. We were charged an extra $50 dollar parking fee for two nights. It was actually supposed to be $40 but they seemed to tack on an extra $10 for a "deposit" (Phone and Television were not included, but were probably an extra $50) The room was only worth 100 dollars. We had an "executive" view of the dirty brick building across from us and we had holes in the walls. Nice huh? Oh yeah and we were basically threatened at the desk. We were told "If there is ANY noise or disturbance we will evict you." We were also discriminated against because we were "under 21" I feel personally offended that they discriminated agenst us. We are paying customers. A word to the wise, if you are looking for a nice place to stay with nice people, DON'T GO HERE!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8370862">We had a 2-night stay in mid-July 2007 and found the hotel convenient (right across the street from the public library - a Rem Koolhass gem!). In the "free ride" zone, this hotel was just fine. We are 2 NJ teachers who prefer to spend our money on what we see and eat than where we sleep, but we do demand a clean and comfortable hotel. This fit the bill. We liked the free internet on the 2 house computers. Lots of nice restaurants in the immediate area. Convenient to Pioneer Square and within walking distance of (or free bus ride to) the main shopping district and the Monorail to the Space Needle. Nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8267119">I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The room was clean, small but comfortable, everything worked well, and the staff was all very pleasant. There is a cardio room with an eliptical, bike, and treadmill, that I think is new. I used it and it is small and worked well for my needs. I looked out to the new Seattle Library, which was fantastic. I walked everywhere, but remember that the downtown area is in the "free zone' of the Metro, so you can hop on a bus and to to another part of the free zone. And, I had 2 beautifully sunny days in Seattle! A fantastic place!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8252546">My husband and I just stayed at the hotel in mid-July and had a horrible experience there. Not only was our Superior Queen room incredibly cramped, but the noises from the elevator and other guests' rooms made it nearly impossible to sleep through the night. Also, the hotel promises other amenities such as wireless internet access from the rooms, but it wasn't working while we were there. We felt like we paid too much for this place and it set a sour tone for the beginning of our vacation. After two nights, we cancelled the rest of our stay there and booked at a new hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8066483">The hotel was clean and central to shopping, restaurants,etc. there was a restaurant on the main floor but unfortunately it was reserved that night for a wedding. Just across the street was a great restaurant that served these little shrimp fritters called beignets and really good corn bread, so moist. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but one thing that wasn't good about it was that we had to park our car in the covered parking area and walk in the alley to get back to the hotel lobby. It seemed inconvenient, they did have valet parking but it cost $25.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8038898">We stayed in this hotel for two nights and then returned for one more night before leaving Seattle. We had a king size room and it was actually a very large room, but the bathrooms were very small both times. The sink was so tiny the second time with no room to put any toiletries anywhere. Overall the room was clean and had a nice bed and flat-screen TV. There is also some road noise from the street. The parking was $19 a night with in and out privileges. Good location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR7845267">My boyfriend and I stayed here last November, just before Thanksgiving. Not the best time to visit, of course, but i used to live there and wanted to show him what it was like (rain, dark, wind) for me the years I was there. As someone who DID live in seattle, i thought this was the perfect location in between downtown and the financial district, to get a perfect taste of the downtown area. From there, we could walk to Pike Place Market or in the other direction to Pioneer Square. Our room faced the gorgeous architecture of the library. Our room was extemely cozy, but we got a good deal on a package so it was worth every penny. If i'd paid a lot for the room, i would be less pleased. Our room had a door (locked of course) connecting it to another room. The people in the other room were quite loud. And we're not fussy people that need silence or anything. But through the door we could hear them talking and what seemed like a dozen babies of different ages crying and babbling. Not very romantic. BUT! We loved the bed! It was so comfortable, we were inspired to take many naps and someday have a bed just like it in our own house. The linens were amazing, as were the pillows. I would definitely go back to this hotel, and plan to, in a more sunny time of year. Nice that there was a Seattle's Best Coffee shop connected to the lobby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7808071">The rooms in this hotel are small, but clean. The staff was courteous, but not helpful. I have three complaints. My room was very noisy. I could hear the pipes rattling all night when people ran water or flushed the toilet. And I could hear the people in the next room dragging their hangers across the clothes rods in the closet. These noises made it really hard to sleep and I am not a light sleeper. I think a light sleeper wouldn't get a wink of sleep in this hotel. Although the front desk staff was very nice when I asked her to send a fax, she didn't actually send it. I didn't learn that she never sent the fax until I returned home--three days after I thought my fax had been sent. I asked the front desk to send up a bottle of hair conditioner. The person sent up a PARTIALLY USED bottle of the same conditioning shampoo I already had. That grossed me out.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7696311">I stayed 2 nights at the Executive while in Seattle on business. The rooms are small but that was to be expected as it is a boutique hotel. I was not prepared for the size of the bathroom, however. I literally had to step into the stall shower to close the door. My room was obviously part of a suite at one time as there was a door to the adjoining room (blocked by a large TV) through which I could hear every word of the conversations my neighbors were having. The hotel offers free wireless which is nice but no desk on which to work. The bed was amazing, however. Very comfortable. Nice pillows. Great down comforter. And the air conditioning worked quite well too. Seattle's Best coffee house in the lobby was a great bonus. Plus you can't beat the location for the price. If these were my only complaints, I would stay here again. After all, you do sacrifice some amenities for price and charm. However, these are minor compared to the quality of the service I received at this hotel. I should have been prepared for poor service since, when I called to confirm a late arrival, they answered the phone with a plain "hello" instead of announcing the hotel. I arrived at 11:00 pm and neither one of the 2 young men behind the counter moved to hold the door or help me with my bags. The lobby is a few steps up from the elevator and, after checking in, neither of them moved to help me get my bags down the stairs either. They literally stood behind the desk and watched me struggle with them. The housekeeping staff was not much better. The room looked like it had been just neatened, not cleaned. The in room coffee pot was not washed out. The carpet was not vacuumed. Hopefully the owner of this hotel will read this review and shape up his staff.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6822839">My sister and I spent two days in Seattle and stayed at the Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel. We chose this hotel because it was affordable and in a prime location. For travelers who are only going to be using thier hotel room to sleep and shower, this is a great choice. It is not a luxury hotel, but a practical choice for active tavelers. Here's what we thought of the hotel: PROS: -Location, location, location. The hotel is across the street from the stunning Seattle Library, and within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. -Affordable. Of all the downtown hotels we looked at this was the least expensive. -Friendly staff. The front desk attendants helped us make the most of our stay by recommending restaurants and calling taxis. Also, they offer complimentary maps, and will loan you an umbrella to use for the day. -Newly renovated. The hotel is certainly old, but they have made an effort to update the look with new modern furnishings. The down comforters on the bed were wonderful! -Clean. Although there was a faint smell of old smoke in the hall, our room and bath was neat and clean. I saw no signs of mold or dirt. CONS: -It's Small. The lobby, the rooms, the bathrooms--they're all small. My sister and I were able walk around comfortably, but there's certainly no extra space. I think it would feel cramped if there were more than two guests in a room. -It's a Buget Hotel. Travelers who are used to the luxury of larger resort hotels will be dissapointed. However, as I've said before, if you're only using the hotel room to sleep and shower, it's more than adequate. -It's Old. While they have made an effort to revamp the hotel, there's no hiding the fact that the building itself is old. There was a faint smell of old smoke in the halls and the doors have obviously been painted many times. Carpet, furniture, and bathroom fixtures, however, are new. -Street noise. While street noise will be a problem in any downtown hotel, this hotel doesn't have the thicker windows that many of the newer hotels are installing. The noise wasn't enough to keep us from sleeping. Overall, a great pick if you're looking for a clean, affordable place to crash before hitting the town again. If you're looking for something luxurious or romantic, this probably isn't the place for you. Hope this helps! Enjoy Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6777999">Nothing impressive about this hotel. It's OK if you're on a budget, not looking for anything more than the basics and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room. The down comforters are a nice touch, but that's about it. The rooms are tiny tiny and the walls are very thin. And the bathrooms ... We first checked into a room where the toilet didn't flush correctly. We asked to move to another room, and in this one, the industrial-style toilet handle stuck out underneath the toilet lid, so you couldn't put the lid down. (See photo.) Bad design. The best thing the hotel's got going for itself is its central location -- a quick downhill stroll to the shops and restaurants on 1st Avenue and ferries (for a ride over to Bainbridge Island). Pike Place Market is within easy walking distance, too. Friendly tip: There are some rooms located directly across from the elevator, make sure your room isn't one of them.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6560208">My husband &amp; I stayed at this hotel 2 days before Christmas in a Superior Queen Room. The room's size was perfect -- chair by the window, large armoir w/TV that had 3 drawers for your stuff, queen bed and nightstand on each side. Bathroom was very small, but adequate. Everything was clean and the bed had great pillows and a wonderful down comforter -- very comfortable! We booked online and, luckily, printed out our confirmation w/room rate. Had to show this to the manager in order to get that room rate. Other than that, we had no complaints. Old hotel -- quite charming -- location is GREAT -- close to everything! Parking is available in garage next door for $19/day.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6020104">I stayed at a standard room alone. Even though there was no view from a small window in my room, the room was very clean and cozy. I think it's enough for a single traveler to stay the standard room. The location is very nice. It's close to sea and market. I recommend that you should take a walk to market, and have a breakfast there. When i visit to Seattle again, I will book this hotel. For this time I booked this hotel at pacificplazahotel.com because they offer cheaper price than expedia.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5627950">We recently stayed at the hotel for a two day getaway and were quite happy with the place. The room was small but clean and had updated decor. We did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it was trendy &amp; the menu looked quite good. The hotel has a fantastic location, especially since we were doing the tourist thing, and walked all over the downtown area. It was 10 minutes to Pike Place market, the monorail, and to Pioneer Square (lots of street people). Since it's an old building the room was a little noisy during the night (doors slamming, pipes running, etc.) so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. The internet in the lobby was spotty and quite slow, so don't expect to do any work there. Service was very good &amp; we liked that Seattle's Best coffee shop was just off the lobby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5574255">The hotel was barely ok- the location was terrific. When you enter the lobby, you either have to go down or up a flight of stairs to get to the elevator - not handicapped friendly, for sure. Also, the room was very small, dingy, with a non-working air conditioner. It usually isn't required in Seattle, but on 2 of the days we were there, we sure could have used it. The bathroom was small, could not accomodate my toiletries. The toilet lid did not stay up by itself - so it was quite an inconvenience for my traveling companion (male) and had to be held up with one hand. It wasn't something that could easily be fixed, because there was a ledge built in over it that was obviously not measured correctly. When the window was open, the bathroom door did not stay closed (painted over too many times), so we had to wedge a washcloth in the door. The bedspread was very old and cheap-looking, like something out of a cheap motel. The carpets were in bad shape, too. My pillow was lumpy - and only one per person. I had to ask for more - got them the next day, after a second request. The help was nice, as were the housekeepers. The location made it tolerable, but without some serious interior renovations, I would not choose this hotel again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5456648">This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life! It was disgusting, dark and dirty. The rooms are like closets. The carpet was awful.

I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here if your looking for R&amp;R.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5429811">We booked this hotel and were confused when we arrived as it did not seem to be as the website indicated. The name is so similar to the Pacific Plaza and Tripadvisor do not differentiate as the confusing travellers reports indicate. The Executive Pacific Hotel is meant to be a boutique hotel. It is overpriced and shabby. The rooms are tiny and the room service dreadful. There is no bar or dining facilities. There is a coffee shop at ground floor and a japanese restaurant next door. I complained my phone was not working on arrival and 4 days later they fixed it and no apology. I had messages waiting from my arrival date and they had done nothing. . The public space is split level and simple. The experience was unexciting and all in all it was a big dissappointment. There are better places to stay and we walked passed many of them during our stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4740991">The location is good and the price is hard to beat for downtown. From the 6th floor the traffic noise is low enough not to unduly disturb your sleep. The bathrooms were very clean. The high speed internet was free. That being said: 1) The pillows on the bed were stinky, as if many sweaty heads had lain on them. 2) The heads were probably sweaty because the thermostat was broken and all you could get was OFF or REALLY HOT. Fortunately the weather was mild enough that "OFF" was an acceptable option since no one was willing to do anything about it. Which makes sense since the entire 6th floor seemed to be thusly afflicted (a sampling of 3 rooms). Finally, I'm curious as to how disabled people might access the rooms as I don't think you can get to an elevator w/o dealing with stairs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4476692">Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel, Downtown Seattle. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody as the basic hygene conditions were also not met. On checking in and visiting the washroom, the toilet had urine in it. The towel had shaved hair on it. The bath tub did not drain and I was forced to be partially submerged in dirty water while taking a shower. Try and find another place, any other place but not this.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4104391">We had 2 nights in this hotel in September before taking an Alaskan cruise and the experience couldn't have been better. An older, moderately-priced hotel, but a better standard of accommodation than we were expecting for the price. The room was spacious, with a king bed, and very comfortable. No view, but we didn't pick the hotel for that. A friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Not as formal as other hotels we stayed in on our holiday, but perfect for this hotel. And absolute top marks to the Concierge, Zach. A welcoming and helpful presence at the front of the hotel. Always ready to ask what our plans were as we headed out sightseeing (and to make suggestions of things to see) and to ask how the day had been as we returned, tired and footsore. But he went further than that. We flew from New Zealand to San Francisco, then on to Seattle, and United managed to leave one bag behind in San Fran. We sorted it out at the airport and were assured it would be sent on the next available flight and delivered to the hotel. That was at 2pm. By about 8pm my wife realised that her insulin was in the missing bag. I went down to reception to ask if there was a way of ringing United at the airline's expense. The receptionist was rather vague, but Zach came over to ask what was wrong, then took over. By then United's normal offices were closed and weren't answering their phone at the airport either. But Zach somehow tracked down a United supervisor and stressed the urgency of the matter. He followed this up twice more before his shift ended at 10pm. The bag was finally delivered to our room at 2am, but Zach's efforts went way beyond what we expected. Since returning home we have contacted the hotel manager and expressed our great appreciation of Zach's assistance. Back to the hotel. A handy location - easy walking to downtown, waterfront, Pioneer Square. The return trip, up some of those steep streets can be tiring though. And having a Seattle's Best attached to the hotel is wonderful as well - those hot caramel apple ciders!!! Who needs Starbucks? Seattle's a lovely city and we want to return to spend longer. And our first stop will be this hotel. We would only look elsewhere if they happened to be fully booked.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR4089727">Approximately three weeks ago, my husband, our dog and myself were repeat guests at the Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel for a quick business trip. Just the month prior we had stayed there for 5-days along with my father for my son's graduation and had a great time. The majority of the staff was quite friendly and inviting. The price was very affordable, the rooms were nice and the location was amazing for our needs. The only challenge I encountered was when I reserved the room and asked the very nice reservationists that confirmation be directed via e-mail so I could forward my fathers for his itinerary as he was traveling up from California. I was assured this would occur, it did not. For the most part the experience was great; so I had been talking up this property with is affordability and location. When I needed to return for business, I again selected this property due to the positive experience three weeks prior. Although, this time I booked my reservation on-line through a third party so that I would immediately receive a confirmation as well as itinerary for my travels and that is exactly what occurred. I called the property in advance to confirm arrangements and informed them that we would be bringing our dog again. They confirm acknowledgement. Upon arriving at the property, I mentioned that we were returning after just three weeks of our previous visit, of which was acknowledged. We were assigned our room, which when we entered we were not quite so impressed. The room was located in a wing of the hotel, where at the end of the hallway there were four rooms clustered and there were hand written signs on the room doors around ours stating that they were painting. It was located on the same floor as our previous room, although rather than a king bed there was a queen. The room was very small and cramped with a view of all of the back of the house workings and systems, although we would not be staying long so this was not a big issue. From the time we checked in until I needed to leave for my event at 5:00pm, there was the sound of possibly a paint sprayer, which did not cause too much discomfort. We returned back at the hotel at approximately 11:30pm, very tired from a total of 4-days of travel and early to late events. We slept just fine until promptly at 7:47am we were awaken by the sounds of staff yelling back and forth to each other. This stopped for about 50 minutes until it again began. We decided it was time to pack up and leave anyway, so no big deal (I guess?). My husband took the dog out for a walk and then to put her in the car while I continued to prepare for our departure. He came back to tell me that when he went back to our car, he found that it had been broken into. He contacted the garage attendant and was told that it was a 17 level garage and this happens all the time. This is the only offered parking by the hotel. At this point, weighing out the entire experience in such a limited stay, I was now feeling quite disappointed and decided to share my experience with management. So upon check out I asked the very nice front desk attendant if I could speak with a manager in regards to my experience and she stated that she was the Front Desk Supervisor and did I wish to speak with the General Manager. I told her I was comfortable speaking with her if she was comfortable with that and she then could share with her GM. She said yes. I went on to explain my entire experience, of which she empathized and then I added that it appeared apparent to me that I was penalized by booking through a third party with the room assignment and even when the opportunity was raised to upgrade me, no one chose to and I was quite confident their hotel was not at 100% occupancy. I also stated that they new there would be construction noise and that they could have given me the option of whether I would or would not be bothered by it in advance. She did not argue these facts. She offered to credit the parking charge and said that she would have credited my room night charge, but that I had already paid????? That was just insult to injury at that point. I do have to say that after all was said and done we were treated better by the parking garage management, who graciously offered to vacuum out all of the glass in our car from the window the thief broke at no charge, so that we could let our dog in I have been in the hotel management business for the past 10-years and believe I have an understanding point of view, although all and all, I have never have my patronage so unappreciated. The hotel has so much potential and I understand that it just recently changed ownership/management in July. But they need to remember that they just need to make people feel special and that goes a long way to the guest experience, regardless of the things that are out of their direct control. It has now been three weeks and I have not had any follow-up from the hotel. All and all, my experience was disappointing!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4051020">If you are traveling on a budget and want the best location and the nicest room possible for around a $100, this is the place. It is an older, but well maintained hotel, that is within walking distance of Pike's Place Market (about 1/2 mile one way). It is located across the street from the new Seattle Central Library. You can park your car and not use it again until you are ready to check out. An advantage in a city that has serious traffic and parking problems. The competition in this price range is mostly cheap hotel chains such as Comfort Inn that are mostly located on freeway onramps, where you need to drive to everything. Note: The Pacific Plaza Hotel does not have its own parking lot but does have an agreement with the attached parking garage for a discount price for its customers ($18 per day as of 10/05).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3810636">Relatively cheap by downtown standards, the PP offers little more than a place to sleep -- and without AC, not sleep well when daytime temps soar. There are fans in the rooms, but they can do nothing about the humidity. Numerous air purifyers operating throughout the hallways don't quite get the musty smell out. I've seen bigger bathrooms on cruise ships, but at least you need not worry about falling down -- there's no room to do it. While I'm sure the bellhop would help with bags, the elevator doesn't stop at ground level -- you either carry your luggage down about 20 steps or up 10 steps. (I don't think wheel chairs could be accom- modated -- check with hotel,) You decide if it's worth $100/night more for amenites lacking in this older but adequate facility. Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on site with good coffee and bakery items. Walk to many downtown sites and restaurants or ride the 'free zone' busses in the downtown area. I initially was going to give this 2 stars, but in reviewing the plusses -- location, price and friendly staff -- I elevated my rating.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3735843">We were in Seattle just one night and opted for location and price over lack of air conditioning -- but our room was quite uncomfortably warm, even with the large screened window and both a ceiling and bureau fan going full speed. Location is prime -- we walked right across the street and had a wonderful tour of the Seattle Library, then walked down the street to the Pike Market and up the street to the Frye Museum. Staff very pleasant. Room was also pretty small for the three of us (adult couple and teenage daughter). Coffee shop in the lobby was good for quick continental breakfast.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3598844">It's been 6 months since we stayed in this hotel over the Xmas season but I just wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay here. Yes, late but still, I'm sure things don't change that much. We were apprehensive about the hotel before arrival from reading about it and the fact that it is a very old hotel in the downtown area. I was nervous that it would be in skid-row. Heehee. It wasn't. It was great that way. What sold us was that it is a completely NON-SMOKING hotel! YES! That did it. When we arrived, the room was small and seemed old but it was very clean. It could use more light. The washroom is very tiny like everyone says. Still, the location is GREAT and the room was very quiet. We faced the library, away from the main street. We enjoyed the easy access to everything so much that we left the car parked in the parking lot for 4 days. Yes, it did cost $18 a day to park. Ouch. The lobby/mezzanine area was actually bright, large and inviting. It was more contemporary and newer with sofa/reading area and free internet computers. Still, we loved our little cubby-hole and would definitely stay there again! It isn't a 4-star hotel but we were open minded enough to enjoy the old world charm. It's CLEAN and feels very safe. Those are the things that are important and oh... the price was good too. About $70ish a night. -Mae<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3549608">Only real concern was lack of a/c in rooms. Temp was in the 60's the week I was there, so that was not a problem. Each room has a ceiling fan and a small oscillating fan. Two colleagues and myself were in Seattle for business meetings at the "W", but we stayed at the Plaza. It is literally 'next door" to the "W", at 1/3 the price. Rooms are small, older, but very clean. Beds were great. My wife came to town the day the conference ended and we stayed 3 more nights at the Plaza. If my experience for the first three nights had been unsatisfactory, we wouldn't have stayed the rest of the week. If you just want a place to sleep and shower, it can't be beat.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3539644">We booked our room after reading a review that said this hotel was "European" style. Having spent considerable time in Europe, we were very disappointed in the size of the room--very small; the esthetics--dreary, old, depressing, and noisy; and the price, which we felt was really ridiculous for this room. We had just come from Little America in Salt Lake City, which could account for our disappointment. The only positives I can find are the location--great--and the desk staff--very helpful. It seems that the hotel's location gives them the "right" to offer a very substandard experience. After reading the reviews since we stayed there, it doesn't sound like any changes for the better have been made.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR3420071">I spent four nights at the Pacific Plaza, and while I was not overly impressed with my hotel room, it was perfectly adequate for what I needed. I found the bed to be quite comfortable, even if the three pillows were small and a bit squished. The room contained a queen-sized bed, a large upholstered chair, a medium dresser and a large television set. The bathroom was small but very clean, and fresh towels and soap were provided every day. I was very happy with this hotel for the price that I paid. I enjoyed the coffee shop on the main level, and the visitor lobby (complete with free internet acessible computers) was wonderful. The staff were friendly, as were the majority of the guests. I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

It is a wonderful place to stay. They are very accommodating and courteous. The location of the hotel is wonderful. Great place, great prices, great people!! Once you go, you won't go any place else.

<comment category="negative" id="UR3169733">My husband and I stayed at this hate for the weekend of 4th - 7th Feb 2005. I booked the hotel some time ago, before some of the negative comments so upon re-checking the website before I set off I was a little apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived late and were greeted by a rather unfriendly bellboy, not the end of the world but certainly a long way of a warm welcome. Our room was fine, weâ€™d been upgraded to a king and it was fairly comfortable. In the morning however I noticed that the bathroom hadnâ€™t really been cleaned all that well. I would stay the standard of cleanliness was debatable, not too bad though if youâ€™re not fussy. Having been out and about all day my husband and I returned ot the room around 4pm, and it was a cold inside as it was outside. I check with reception nd they said that they have to turn the heating off during the day to prevent the system from overheating! What! Heating came back on at 8pm. Another point to note was that the walls are very very thin. Our neighbours were watching Bridgett Jones; we managed to hear every word, given that Iâ€™d seen the film before I wasnâ€™t so excited about hearing it again at 11pm. On a positive the location was great. The hotel cost $89 a night (booked directly â€“ no breakfast) although I did notice Expedia had rooms going for $79 a night. We didnâ€™tâ€™ spend an awful lot of time in the hotel, I do think you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR3027832">Ok, so this hotel is inexpensive for Seattle city centre, but we think that cleanliness should be included in the price! We switched rooms as the bathroom was definitely cruddy and the bed sheets looked and smelled like they had been slept in and just smoothed over. The front desk gave us another room with no qualms. Rooms are a bit pokey and ours had a view of the parking lot opposite, but for one night before our flight the next day, it sufficed. The hotel is well-located for seeing the sights if you don't mind walking, you can get the monorail to the Space Needle just down the street too. The airport shuttle drop-off is a convenient block away. Last word, the breakfast is fine if you're on the go, coffee and danish from Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2908397">Stayed for a night 18 december 04 and didn't quite live up to my expectations, but still a decent value overall. Very convenient location downtown, close to shopping. Staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. There was a cozy coffee shop across adjacent to the front desk. The hotel was VERY clean considering it was an 80-year-old building, but the rooms were quite small and ambient noise from the other rooms was quite apparent. beds were clean and comfortable, but the pipes in the building made heaps of noise in the middle of the night. Probably not the best choice if you're a light sleeper, but still a good value right downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR2820602">Who are you people who love this hotel? My trip to Seattle was perfect, except for having to stay at this perfectly horrid place. We had a corner "suite" which was actually a tiny room with hardly enough room to get around the incredibly hard and lumpy bed. The bathroom was so small that we had to take turns at the sink, as two people will not fit in there at the same time unless one person stands in the tub! It was cold the night we stayed, and the heat didn't work. Housekeeping walked into the room at 8 a.m without waiting for us to answer the door, just knocked once and came right in! As for location, it was probably once a charming hotel. It sits up on the hill right across the street from the public library. It's a good 8 or more blocks down to the waterfront, which isn't so bad going down, but it's quite a trek to walk back up--this is not a small hill, it's very steep, so look forward to getting in some cardio during your stay. And pack comfortable shoes, it's at least two miles to the space needle. Don't get roped into the "suite with deluxe breakfast" deal, either. The deluxe breakfast consists of a small drip coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop downstairs. All in all, including taxes, we paid almost $200 a night for a cup of coffee and a room that rates no better than a Motel 6. For the price, I've had much, much better accomodations. My best suggestion after seeing the area, stay at the Marriott on the waterfront. It's only a few dollars more, just steps from the Pike St. Market, and sits on the water. The rooms are gorgeous (and HUGE!) and it's central to everything. We also had dinner at a place called The Brooklyn. Highly recommend. Stellar service, and amazing food. I truly enjoyed my trip to Seattle, but next time we'll do one thing very differently. STAY AT A BETTER HOTEL!!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR2592770">After reading some of these reviews I was quite surprised by how wonderful this hotel really is. It was very clean and neat-- nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room that we had was what I would consider to be an above average size for a big city hotel. I did not find it too hot or too cold. The bathroom may be a problem for some people who are larger because the toliet sits right next to the bathtub. I also enjoyed having Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on the ground floor for breakfast pastries and coffee every morning. The hotel is within a close walk to Pioneer Square, the Piers, Pike Place Market, and Nordstrom, etc. We even walked back from the Space Needle at night and it was not really that bad-- but definitely pack your best walking shoes.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR968033750">nice, but don't wait for the shuttle After coming in from Florida and calling 3 times for a shuttle pick-up, it arrived 45 minutes later. It would have been much easier just to drag the luggage down across the street to the hotel in about 5 minutes. Room on the 7th floor was smokey, night manager very helpful and changed our room immediately to a nonsmoking floor. Housekeeping did a good job, front desk helpful, halls showing definite signs of wear. Room itself was quite nice (king), sleep number beds overrated, but for $45 on Priceline, can't complain!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR741034597">Save on rental car! The Radisson is a short walk from the baggage claim: just walk to the first light and cross the street! The sleep number beds were a nice option here. My husband and I were thinking of buying one, so it was nice to try it out. It is right next to 13 Coins Restaurant: 24 hours of great Italian dining, and very quiet. We felt that it was a great way to save on a rental car: we just walked to the hotel, and then rented the next day. Very fast check in and nice rooms.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR183096829">Great Location for Airport, But . . . This hotel is about as close as you can possibly get to a major airport -- literally a 10-minute walk to the airport. However, room was small, with poor heat/AC control, and overpriced relative to a much more spacious room that we had at the Bellevue Hilton. Would recommend only for an overnight stay for an early morning flight.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR264908660">Pretty good overall I was pretty happy with the room, and it was a full service hotel so we had help with our luggage and room service and needed to call the front desk for a favor a few times and they were happy to oblige. The room size was fine for two adults (standard king). We liked the sleep number bed, but we don't exactly think they're all that wonderful. We never heard plane noise because we weren't facing the front of the hotel. The manager told us this, because we asked for a quiet room and they said then choose something that doesn't face the airport! So we picked the top floor (so we wouldn't have neighbors above us) that faced away. I never heard a single plane and I kept the window open all night long. Which brings me to my complaint. Perhaps it was the time of the year (Febuary) but they said the a/c won't cool to a temperature any lower than what it is outside. (Which really wasn't even true because I couldn't get it lower than 75-78 and outside it was 50). This is after they brought an engineer up to look at it and then had us move two doors down thinking our a/c was broken. So they told us that that was just the way the a/c worked but maybe it would be better by the next time we come back. I told them I had been uncomfortable sleeping for days and at check-out they refunded for about 2-3 nights worth of our stay. The manager was very friendly and tried to help as much as possible. So even though I think Radisson's climate control system is nuts, it isn't the manager's fault and they did do everything they could to try to correct it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR134972758">Nice place to stay My wife and I choose to stay here after a flight from the east coast. We flew in a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel but it would be MUCH easier just to exit the airport, turn right and start walking toward the other hotels you can see in the area. You will quickly see the Radisson. It is easily within walking distance from the airport. Our room rate for a single king was $109. I made my reservations online thru Expedia. Our check-in was quick and easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and clean. The Sleep Number bed was comfortable. We used the Towne Car service for the 25 minute ride to the Space Needle ($40). A very nice service in a Lincoln Towne Car. The price of a taxi is roughly $38 without tip. We were very pleased with the Radisson and would stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR899270015">No 3* Hotel Got this hotel through Priceline for $43 a night. We have stayed at the SeaTac Hilton and Doubletree Hotels for the same price in the past and was hoping for the same. No such luck unfortunately.Pros: free parking for guests. One free bottle of water. Newspaper in the morning.Cons: sleep number bed way over-rated. Give me a Heavenly Bed or Hilton bed any night! It was nothing special. The bed linens were plain and did not feel clean. Definitely not luxurious. The bathtub was old and grimy. No rubberized bath mat so the floor of the tub was slippery. Ice machine on the floor did not work. Guest checkout and hotel evaluation on TV did not work. Room moderately quiet- airplane noise not a problem after 11 PM.Bottom line- this is no 3* hotel (2* at best) and I hope we never have to stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR887193841">Was a horrible experience! Our family of four booked this hotel on hotwire so we had no idea what we were getting before we agreed. When I saw it was the Radisson I was sort of thinking I got a great deal for $60. Was I ever wrong. There were water stains on the ceiling, musty smell in the room. The glasses were dirty with lipstick marks on them and it wasnt too modern. I thought to myself Well for $60 what do you expect? What I didnt expect was for my 12 year old to sit on the bed and say what's wrong wtih the bed mom Me going over there to discover the bed was broken. The frame was all twisted up and it was rigged to somewhat try to work. We called management who came up and took a look, apologize and give us another room. The next room, same thing. I went to sit on the edge of the bed and the whole bed collapsed!! It too was broken. We called management who came up and said he was sorry again and moved us one more time! This next place was much nicer. They had sleep number beds in them and it seemed more updated then the other horrible rooms we were in. I made a guess that they saved these horrible rooms for hotwire customers and the people paying full price got the nice beds and nice rooms. I called up hotwire who did an investigation and refunded my money!<topic>none</topic>

There was a shuttle to the airport, but it take as much time to get there by foot, just exit the airport and go right. After couple minutes you will see the hotel. We had a front side room. From time to time you could hear planes at the tarmac, but it was more quiet after 10 PM. Room was clean and nice. Free internet connection, breakfast was not free.

<comment category="negative" id="UR380660363">Not your typical Radisson, not luxury by any means I recently returned from a weeklong trip through CA/OR/WA and stayed at the Radisson at SEA-TAC (there are two Radisson hotels within a 3 block radius, so confusion is likely) the night before an early flight. The hotel, while very close to the airport, is not your typical Radisson. I had never before stayed in a Radisson but according to reviews from family members and friends who had, I was expecting a luxury hotel. It appears from the temporary-looking signage and the fact that there is another Radisson three blocks down the street, that Radissson recently acquired this hotel from another chain, perhaps Ramada. This hotel, or perhaps more accurately, motel was nowhere near the standards of luxury. I was disappointed and also glad that I had only booked a room for one night. I would not have been happy to have had an extended stay at the Radisson. It was subpar, at best. My main gripe were the beds, which were very motel-like and certainly not equivalent to what actual luxury hotels are currently offering like Sweet Sleeper's and the Heavenly beds. I happen to subscribe to the belief that the bed is the best indicator of how to rate a hotel and this hotel deserves a measly C-, in my opinion.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR225923751">A great place to park your car We stayed at this hotel for one night before an early morning flight. Included with the one night hotel stay was 7 days of parking for our car during our trip. So, taking the parking into consideration this is a good place to stay and a fair deal. However, I highly recommend that you get there at bedtime and leave first thing in the morning. The room was noisy, had a view of the roof and was worn and dated. There were large gaps in the door out into the hallway.<topic>none</topic>

It was not just a great deal for the room but also a very nice hotel experience. The lobby and guest rooms have just been remodeled and are very clean and modern looking. The crew was actually finishing installing some internet lines while I was there and they said it was the last step in the million dollar investment. The place looks great and I would absolutely recommend it.The comments I see below must have come before the remodel as they do not even come close to fitting the hotel I saw and enjoyed.

<comment category="negative" id="UR982957944">A dump I think Radisson is on a major decline I stay in many of them (because the price is cheap and my company likes that) as I travel around the country on business: They are almost always run down and about half the time, service is terrible. I suspect the good deals on Priceline come along because few want to stay there.This hotel was run down, old and has a reputation with the SeaTac police force of taking in a lot of Rif Raf. The hotel is right next to the airport, so it is convenient time wise if you are taking a flight.If you are looking for a decent hotel, avoid Radisson in general. I am sure there are exceptions, but I haven鈥檛 seen them.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR230295146">Terrible hotel We had booked this hotel night for two nights. One was for the night we flew in to Seattle and the other was for the night before we flew out early in the morning. Well, after that first night, we immediately cancelled the second night and booked the Doubletree airport hotel. The place is so rundown, I can't believe it's a Radisson! There were nasty water stains on the ceiling and the location overall was noisy. There was a party going on all night at the ballroom, which we could hear all the way across the courtyard. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if we were closer. The only saving grace about this place was the breakfast which was really good. This is the first and last time we will ever stay at a Radisson.<topic>none</topic>

Not bad for a Radisson and I did expect worse; however, the constant noise of airplanes landing was very annoying.

<comment category="negative" id="UR974691263">Stark Contrast to the Radisson LA Westside On Aug. 28th my flight from LA was very late and I missed my connection. Since I had such a wonderful time at the Radisson Los Angeles Westside, I was delighted to try the Radisson at Sea-Tac. Well, I was amazed at the difference. The carpeting was filthy. After a shower, (which wasn't very clean), I tried to use my phone and it wouldn't work. I called the front desk to find that since I hadn't left a credit-card imprint, they wouldn't turn my phone on. I explained that I was only making a calling card call anyway, and was told to bring my credit card to the front desk or forget it. I explained I had just gotten out of the shower, it was almost 1:00am, and I'd gladly read my credit card number to him and let them run it in the morning. He basically said that it wasn't his problem, and if I really wanted to use my phone that badly, I'd bring my card up front! Then, out of desparation, I asked if he would call a number for me and just have them call me back, and he said NO! A while later I called someone else at the front desk and requested a wake up call. Well, luckily for me, I set the alarm, because they never called me. Not only that, but 2 out of 4 glasses in my room were disgustingly filthy. I took them to the front desk the next morning and the lady was appauled at their condition. When I told her of my entire experience, she was nice and offered to pay for my room. That would have been great, but it was courtesy of Alaska Airlines anyway. But, at least she tried to make me feel better. Had I not just had such a great stay at the Radisson in Culver City, I would NEVER set foot in another Radisson Hotel. T. Hewitt<topic>none</topic>

The front desk staff was very friendly and I had a corner king room with a great view of the space needle and the waterfront (although obstructed by other buildings). The location is within a short walk of Pike Place Market and all of the downtown shopping. There are also many restaurants nearby. There was a mini fridge in the room with two bottles of complimentary water that was restocked daily and Aveda amenities. My one complaint is that the elevator took a long time, every time. There appeared to be a large convention in-house, so that was probably the cause of the slowness, but it was still frustrating.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126757262">We stayed here March 22-25 for a conference. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel abuts the highway on one side and sits on top of a hill. Everywhere you walk (other than across the highway to First Hill) is downhill....until you need to walk back up, of course. It wasn't a problem for us, but might be for others. Our room on the 22nd floor was quiet. The elevators were a bit slow at rush hours. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and well designed. There was a plug, a mirror and a light everywhere you needed one, plenty of room to unpack and even a mini fridge with complimentary bottled water. The bathroom, while not particularly large or luxurious, was spotless, and more than met our needs, with plenty of counter space, towels, Aveda products and perhaps most importantly, water pressure. Our only complaint about the room was that the thermostat had a motion-detector which did not detect our presence at night when we were asleep. It wasn't a huge problem in March (so we did not call maintenance), but might be in August. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and competent. If I could give a 4 1/2 star rating here, I would. We especially received great service from Fred, the concierge who helped with dinner reservations for a group of 8-12 two nights in a row. Both dinners, at nearby Sip and Tulio's, were great. Our meals in the hotel's own Maxwells and the Lobby Lounge were good too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126712359">My wife bid for a two night stay (10-12 March 2012) at Priceline.com as a surprise for my birthday and this is the hotel we were booked into. No problem with the reservation - everything was as advertised. Arrived around dinnertime on Saturday 10-March - check-in went fine...UNTIL we found out how much they intended on charging for parking - $30/day plus $6 car charge + other taxes. Shocking, and took an ok deal into the "meh" category and I have big problems paying $40 to park my car. Chris and Christina were manning the front desk that evening, and couldn't have been more understanding and nice about it. Christina upgraded us to a "Corner King" as a gesture for my b-day, and dealt with our parking sticker shock as well in a very natural, kind, customer-oriented manner that turned a potential disaster into a better-than-average experience in less than 10 mins. My wife and I can not say enough about the customer-service attitude about the staff at this hotel - simply phenomenal and Chris/Christina deserve special mention for going "over and above". The hotel is a VERY tall building located right on the I-5 - we were facing the freeway on the 11th floor and the roar from the highway was non-stop and very noticeable (they were booked solid that weekend and couldn't get us a higher room, on the east side). Strongly, STRONGLY suggest that you request a high room on the West side of the hotel as soon as you book - the noise from the freeway was pretty bad though continuous so except for the trucks and sirens it turned into white noise after a while. Public spaces are very nice, even luxurious - reminds me of the Four Seasons in NY in terms of style. Pool was closed and didn't use the weight room. Location (except for the freeway) is fine - it's in the "NoCharge" zone for public transit and it's a 20-25 min walk to Pike Place Market from the hotel. Steep hill going up Madison - go up Pike to 6th St and turn right and you'll have a much easier time of it if you are physically challenged. Room was ok, nothing spectacular (though spotlessly clean). Coffee maker, king-sized bed in a separate room, two wide-screen TVs, very spacious room. Decor a bit dated but again very clean and just fine for a couple of days, or even more than that. It's a good option for downtown Seattle but research parking VERY carefully before booking here or you could be very unhappy.<topic>none</topic>

Room and small but very nice and clean. Room service and the food was really terrific! The morning buffet was nice and the service was amazing with some of the friendliest servers ever.

<comment category="negative" id="UR126424891">I agree with the previous poster. This hotel is way too overpriced if it wants to be competitive with other Seattle hotels based on what it has to offer. I thought the sleep quality was terrible-- my sister is pregnant and was in so much pain sleeping on the beds because they are so hard and uncomfortable. Also, the walls are very thin which makes the rooms susceptible to much outside noise so I highly recommend asking for a room away from the freeways. I personally would never select this hotel again and pay full-price. If I was forced to stay here because of a great Name-Your-Own-Price deal on Priceline, I would be okay with it, but that would be because I wasn't paying full price. Either the prices overall here need to come down, or management needs to invest in some sound barriers, comfier beds and more luxurious rooms in order to draw people from competing hotels in the area. I was very disappointed that this is where I had to stay for my two-night jaunt up to Seattle. (Also- valet fees are so ridiculous. I don't care if people say that this is market price in Seattle-- no one should have to pay $40 to park their car overnight. No one. If you want people to willingly stay here, offer free parking.)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126422942">I probably would have given this hotel a 4 out of 5 - but the amazing customer service I experienced put this place over the edge. Everyone, the bellman, front desk, servers, room service etc. went out of their way to make sure I was happy and taken care of. The roof top bar is not to be missed. There was a local musician doing a show in the lounge on Friday night - nice touch. This is an older hotel, but they have really made an effort to update the guest rooms with nice dark wood and granite. However, the windows are old and a bit drafty. My room on the 25th floor had a fantasic view of the harbor and other nearby builings.

<comment category="negative" id="UR126124403">Probably the worst hotel in which I've ever had the (un)privilege of experiencing. In my more than fifteen years of travelling I don't that I've ever actually starting crying in the hotel room because the hotel room was so terrible. Upon arriving on the late morning of Tuesday, March 13, 2012, the valet was most helpful. We found parking quick and easy. (Although the parking garage needs some much brighter lighting; the parking felt a bit unsafe it was so dark down there.) The front desk girl was happy, smiled, and greeted us warmly. She upgraded us from a $130 room to a corner suite with a king bed for $30 more. Oh, and parking is an additional $35. So, total cost: $190. (We booked through Hotwire, but I've started noticing a trend lately: hotels at which you a book a room via Hotwire more often than tend to have a negative, slightly-unwelcome attitude toward you than their other guests. The Renaissance was one of those hotels.) The room on the fifth floor was clean. Cosy. A bit dark. The room was a north-east facing room, overlooking the: I-5 highway. The bed was clean. Everything was nice and fine. This was the afternoon when we checked in. We went out for dinner and returned around 10 PM. The noise from the I-5â€”which has got to be at least 9 lanes of traffic across is itâ€”was absolutely DEAFENING! It was so bad that my wife had to turn up the TV and I had to grab a blanket and sleep on the couch in the room furthest away from the bedroom. Lame. The noise was still bad, but after much exhaustion in trying to get comfortable on a couch made for a child, and the noise that never stopped, I finally fell asleep. I actually contemplated sleeping in my car in that dark parking garage to get away from the non-stop sound of traffic. At 3 AM, I awoke and went to the bedroom. Still the noise from the never-ending traffic outside was so overwhelming I had to go back to the couch. So, there I slept, for probably 5 hours and not much more, thanks to the hotel room. Why are there double-paned glass windows on a hotel that faces a freeway? Why did the check-in girl not ask us if we wanted a room facing the freeway? Why did the girl at the front desk upon check-out the next morning not ask us how are stay was? Well, if you and your hotelâ€™s owners want to know what we thought of our stay, just read my story above. Oh, and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Ever. I will never use this chain of hotels again and I and my wife will most likely never use Hotwire again. That was just a lame experience in an otherwise beautiful city.<topic>none</topic>

This hotel is fairly central for walking to different areas of the city, try to plan your return from sixth street from the north to avoid the steep hills to the west.

<comment category="positive" id="UR125246249">Good value for downtown Seattle. Would probably rate it a 3.5 star. The service was excellent. The rooms were nice. A little noisy but can be expected for a downtown hotel. All in all, a good experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125004682">We stayed here for the long Presidents' day weekend and had a great stay. I was a little worried after some of the reviews I'd read. Lots of people complained about the workout facilities; we don't go on vacation to work out so we never went anywhere near that so I cna't comment on that. As far as the actual room goes, we requested a room on the west side away from the hotel and as high up as they could get us, and were given a room facing west on the 20th floor. It had a great view of the modern library, many of the tall downtown building and water (I don't think it's the sound, just an inlet or lake or something). We didn't hear any traffic noise up there; what we did hear (and this is something you'd hear anywhere that high up I think) is the wind on one particularly windy day. It still wasn't enough to wake us up or anything. The room was very clean and all of the staff: the front desk clerks, the bartenders, the doormen, the lovely concierges - were fantastic! The bed was very comfortable as well. I think the location was great too. It's about a 15 minute walk down to Pike market and the front desk clerk advised us to walk over to Pike on 5th so that we didn't have to deal with going up or down the massive hill that runs right by the hotel (it's not nearly as severe going down Pike). We didn't have a car, just walked everywhere and nothing seemed to terribly far away. If you do want to take a cab to Pike's Market (we were running late for a tour and had to get there quickly), the doorman will hail one for you and it's only about $6 for the trip down there. I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124936439">I booked this through a 3rd party website... and was glad I didn't pay full price. It was a very pleasant stay, just not sure it was 4 Star as Priceline rates it. In reading other reviews of this property - I was surprised about people who complained that internet is charged... (I stay at many nicer properties similar and everyone charges it) but what got me.. was it was $12.95 per item (so my iPhone and laptop would be $26 per night) and I didn't bother getting it at all. Would I stay at another Marriott? Probably, given that this was the first time at one (I'm usually at Westin or other Starwoods) but - would I book through the hotel website? Probably not. It was Columbus Day weekend, and a parking spot was difficult to find, and manouvering around in the mornings was difficult given that the shortage of parking spots made people park in down ramps, or anywhere in the parkade. Also there was a bad storm, and staying high made for wind to go through the window frames (not enough window sealant) and not sure what would have been quieter... traffice noise from the I-5 or the other side with the high winds. I was surprised with the actual size of the room however - the benefits of an older hotel versus a newly built one.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124921947">Booked this hotel for a week long conference where my husband came along for a much needed break and we had a wonderful stay here. Staff were all great and the room service was perfect. We ate most of our meals in the hotel restaurant and have to say a huge thank you to Robert and Mark for the best service ever!!! The only complaints we have is that the room TV screen seems to be set on the wrong setting as the picture is very distorted and the rooms air conditioner allows the sound of the outside wind to come into the room and it was extremely loud where we had trouble sleeping over it and our final comment....the parking cost is outrageous at $30 a night plus $6 car tax...$36 for a staying guest is just way too much to add onto the price of your room each night. Other than the points mentioned we had a wonderful time here and it was within walking distance to everything we needed and the hills were not too bad to walk as some mentioned. The cocktail lounge was a real treat after an afternoon out shopping and makes the best Cucumber Martini ;-)<topic>none</topic>

The Check in staff was very helpful and kind - the woman at the concierge was amazing (i wish i go her name) she knew what was going on at most of the clubs/live music places. At R view bar, we have the very talented mixologist, Stella creating use wonderful cocktails and gave us recommendations for other interesting places to check out.

<comment category="negative" id="UR124893425">I've used Priceline before to book hotels for Seattle, but in this instance, and like all others, I wanted something right downtown, close to everything. While the Renaissance is considered "downtown" it's kinda a reach to say so, it's right on the end and literally right on the highway. So if you're hoping to do a little shopping downtown expect to either cab it back to the hotel or walk quite a few blocks with bags in your hands. The hotel has been renovated beautifully, the lobby is gorgeous, even the rooms have been renovated nicely..but there's one thing I wouldn't have thought of prior to staying here, and that I've never ever experienced in a hotel in Seattle before. The building is built on springs....I believe for the sake of earthquakes etc. which isn't a problem other than you will hear the ear piercing, and CONSTANT sound of the building swaying and screeching throughout the night with the same rhythm as the wind. After trying to figure out this noise for about 3 hours..we finally called the front desk and they explained all of the above, of course there isn't much they can do about the construction of the building which is understandible, but she kindly offered us earplugs, which we used and finally slept through the remainder of the evening. This also helped drown out the noise of the highway traffic. On a positive note, there are some great restaurants within a nice walk from the hotel, we enjoyed a beautiful dinner at Elliot's on the pier and were able to walk there. The staff were quite nice, the security out front was more than accomodating and offered us directions and an umbrella. It's a nice hotel, that they are definately doing their best with it, but it is older, and the location didn't fit our needs this time around, but for quick accomodations right off the highway on a not so windy day may be worth it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124762703">My family and I booked this hotel through hotwire and received a great rate. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle and is walking distance to Pike's market, the aquarium and many other local tourist attractions. The room itself was nice and included a king size bed, flat screen tv and mini fridge. We were on the 19th floor on the highway side and the noise from the highway was present, but ignorable. Parking was $30/night and since our vehicle didn't fit in the self park, we received one night of valet parking at the self park rate. The desk staff and door men/valet were all very friendly and helpful. The costs of staying at a hotel like this add up: $30 for parking, $15 for internet + tips etc. If budgeting a stay, make sure to include these costs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124693377">We were on foot for a romantic week touring Seattle and found this hotel to be a good value for a 6 night stay near downtown with nice amenities. The good: -Nice lobby/lower lounge area and extremely helpful staff -The R-View lounge on the top floor has fantastic views of the city at less than space needle prices. The intimate size makes for a romantic setting. -Right next to the library, which we though was pretty cool. -There are a lot of good in house dining options for a hotel of this price and the food is not Hilton-unaffordable The bad: -If there is a big conference on, the way that the elevators are programmed means you will never get one (prompt elevators w/o conference present) -There is a bit of road noise no matter where you are in the hotel it seems -We enjoyed the location in close proximity to major city sites and did not mind the exercise of the extra hill climbing on foot, however, less fit car-less patrons may not appreciate this hotel's lofty location. The ugly: I think it needs to be clarified that THIS HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A POOL. I was reading conflicting reports, some raving about a pool and some even including pictures. Other internet searches confirmed the existence of a pool and when I called to ask the front desk prior to booking the woman told me (in an unnecessarily condescending voice, very atypical of the helpful staff we encountered once on site) that there was NOT a pool. I explained that I was only asking because I had seen reports of a pool in online posts about the hotel and she acted as if I was incapable of internet usage. In fact, upon hunting around the hotel we did find the NOW CLOSED top floor pool. Based on the woman's insistence about the nonexistent pool, the stickers blocking out the pool in the hotel in-room brochure and the current state of the pool as viewed through the papered over glass window that once led to it there are no plans for this hotel to have a pool again any time soon. Which is a shame because it looked very nice. They must be very upset about it's departure as well considering they now appear to no longer acknowledge it once existed.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124066923">Whether or not you like the location probably depends on why you're in Seattle. If you're a tourist and without a car, you might not be too happy. I was visiting a company a block a way so it was perfect. I took the light rail in from the airport. It's reasonably fast and convenient, but be prepared for a steep uphill walk to the hotel. If you walk anywhere you'll encounter the hills. If this will be a problem, do not stay here. Every individual I came in contact with was friendly and helpful, from the doorman to the concierge. My corner king room was more of a suite and very pleasant with a nice view and separate temperature control in the living area and sleeping area. The 28th floor fitness center has newer cardio machines and some basic free weights and weight machines. There are multiple restaurants in the hotel, though one isn't open for dinner year-round. My choices were the lobby bar or the 29th floor restaurant. Both have limited menus, and if you want an quick, light, healthy meal, you won't find it. I did find a Subway sandwich shop a couple of blocks away. As others have noted, internet access is $12.95 per day. Mine was free due to my Marriott elite status. But the connection was so slow that I couldn't do some of my online work. I'd have been very upset if I'd been paying for it. Even worse is the incredible sloppiness in attention to detail. One of my room keys didn't work. I didn't get the newspaper I requested. I didn't get my wake up call. Add this to noisy HVAC (hard to sleep through) and cheapness (you only get two cups of coffee, not the customary four) and the overall sense is negative.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR123849462">I stayed at the Renaissance for just one night, but that was more than enough. There were a few pleasant surprises (namely the ability to print airline boarding passes in the lobby and great sweet potato fries at the bistro), and the location is convenient, but overall the visit was disappointing. This current Priceline description has several inaccuracies: The 28-story Renaissance has 553 spacious rooms, with the upper-floor rooms boasting views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, Cascade or Olympic Mountains. Rooms come with mini-fridges, coffee/tea makers, Wi-Fi (for a fee in room, free in lobby), windows that open and flat-panel TVs with premium cable. You'll love flopping onto this bed after a day of Seattle sightseeing. It has a pillowtop mattress, down comforter and cotton-rich linens with triple sheeting. No belly-flopping in the pool: Take a refreshing swim around the splash pool and a soak in the hot tub on the 28th floor, with views of the bay. You also get expansive views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, and the surrounding city from the 28th-floor restaurant and bar. The hotel also has parking (for a fee), a fitness center, second restaurant and lobby coffee bar and lounge. Sounds good. And the windows DO open a bit, the bed is comfortable, and the night views are pretty. Unfortunately, there is no splash pool/hot tub (despite signs in the hotel elevators that also point you to the 28th floor pool). According to the front desk folks, they're being turned into more meeting rooms. That would have been nice to know BEFORE arriving. Also, the water in our bathtub reached warm, but not hot, even when I turned it to max hot. As I didn't have hours to spend with a hotel engineer, I used the coffee maker's hot water to heat up the bath. Servicable, but hardly "luxurious." Also, from 3 to 6 am, our room on the 21st floor made loud creaking noises that actually woke (and kept) me up. (Apparently, according to the woman at the front desk, the hotel is built on rollers, so whenever it's windy out ... it moves and creaks). And then there's that flat screen TV. The picture was poor and the "Daily Special" movies listed for $4.99 were actually $13.99 when I you get to the purchase screeen. I called downstairs and they said: "That's a separate company and they did have that daily deal, but I guess it's over ... but we can't get them to change the menu. So the price is $13.99.) One thing goes wrong, OK. Two, not great, but livable. No pool, no hot water, interrupted sleep, and bait-and-switch movie prices? C'mon, Renaissance, you can do better than that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122952935">I'm getting ready to stay at the Renaissance for the 4th time soon. I've had great experiences every time so far! I always ask for a room away from the highway mostly because I want the view. I have only stayed in a king room so far but the rooms are always awesome!! The beds are huge and soft and there are tons of squishy wonderful pillows. The parking price is a bit of a bummer but I've never had an issue with getting a spot and once they even waived the fee of one of our cars. That was awesome! It isn't "right" by Pike Place but it's only a 6 block walk or a very short cab ride so it's not a problem. The bar upstairs is pretty cool too. I always use Priceline when I book and I've gotten The Renaissance 4 out of 6 times in Seattle. I'm never disappointed when I stay there!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122951097">We booked this hotel using Priceline and for $70, we got wayy more than what we paid for. The staff was super-nice and patient - thoroughly explained how the parking worked, if I needed a city map and what sort of checkout options I have if i wanted to check out but keep my car in the parking lot. We got a king suite, with a beautiful view of downtown Seattle. There was a livingroom-type room when you got in, a huge bathroom and a bedroom at the end of the hallway with surrounding windows. The pool was under renovations unfortunately and the fitness centre had new equipment, but was very tiny (about 6 people could fit in there). The only issue would be the $30/night parking (but that's like every hotel in Seattle). Overall, great hotel and i would definitely stay here again. Had the best sleep of my life in a long time thanks to those wonderful beds!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122712667">I like staying in a highrise hotel at night, looking out the windows, and think about life. I find the Renaissance is a good place to do so. I stay in the suites, which are a good size and nicely decorated. The views are good, but mostly of other buildings rather than the Sound or the Space Needle. I bring my dog who likes to look out the window and watch the cats in the highrise condos nearby. The staff is very helpful. This may be due in part because I have Marriott Rewards status. I recommend this hotel, though it is far from the best hotel I've stayed in. As I write this review, I see a number of other reviews of guests who stayed New Year's weekend. My room on the 19th floor was quiet and I had a good weekend at the hotel. I could see the top of the Space Needle and watched the fireworks.<topic>none</topic>

It would have been better if they had announced in or near the elevator that the whole top floor (where the fitness facilities are) was inaccessible, but instead we found out by finding the exit from the elevator blocked after going to the top floor.

<comment category="negative" id="UR122385151">I stayed at the Renaissance for New Years Eve and would not recommend this hotel for the following reasons. 1. The noise: Even on the 22 floor, the noise was horrible. The windows are barely sealed and let in a lot of noise. 2. Value: I paid a premium to stay on New Years eve for a perceived Four Star hotel. About $166 with taxes from HotWire. Parking was $30 plus a $6 Parking tax. 3. Location: Other than being next to a highway, the location is fairly good. Close to Capital Hill and the downtown area. 4. Amenities: We had drink sand appies in the lounge and the beer was good and not too expensive. Food was average. The lounge was a nice touch and they had a great singer performing. Free wifi in this area. 5. Room: The room was a decent size. The pillows were not comfortable. The room did show some age. 6. The Staff: Very friendly and helpful including finding a cab during a busy rush. Conclusion: It is a four star wannabe hotel. Its rough around the edges and would have rather paid more to stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR122086961">My stay here has been the absolute best ever!!. This coming from a guy that has dealt with it all (about a dozen times in Seattle); from the dirty rooms at the Quality Inn by Seatac to the snobby, charge-hiding staff at the Sheraton on 6th Ave, this place is awesome in comparison. The kindness and friendliness of the staff is just unprecedented. I mean where do I start; from the sea-view room upgrade right off the bat, to getting 5 days of internet for free and finally the complementary last-day late check-out cuz I didn't get much sleep the night before. It obviously met the other regular standards: prime location (going downhill at least), clean room, comfy beds, flat screen, pool, hot tub and a small 'gym'. They also have a knowledgeable and competent concierge that helped make out the best of our time. I should have been bummed out by the fact the top-floor bar/lounge was closed for repairs but instead I found myself 'forced :D' to extend my stay cuz it felt just a tad bit nicer than home.

This hotel claims they are 4 stars and their bath products are supposed to be from a well known spa so I thought "hey how bad can it be?". REAL BAD!!! My skin had an allergic reaction to this horrible soap and lotion and I scratched NON stop day and night for 2 weeks and am still itchy. I have been to 5 different doctors which included an allergist, a dermatologist and the ER!!! I was told my skin has severely reacted to something I have used which has caused my psoriasis to flare up like never before. AND The ONLY thing I have done different is use the bath products at this so called "4 star" hotel. In almost 35 years i have NEVER experienced skin problems even half as bad as i have since staying at the hotel. The staff was not helpful, parking was outrageous, security questioned us like we were trying to steal something, for the first time ever at a 4+star hotel I was charged for milk for my baby, the call button on the intercom from the parking Garage was not functioning so i had to Walk back into the hotel.

<comment category="negative" id="UR121830233">Booked through hotwire, thought the four-star rating meant that we'd be well looked-after. Instead, the hidden fees brought the cost from the initially "great deal" of $99/night up to around $158/night. The $22/night room tax, the $30/night parking fee + $6/night parking tax plus the very noisy room facing I-5 ensured that we will not be back. The extra $13/night for wifi was just plain gouging. When we heard the cost, we elected to not bother. Seriously? An up-charge for wifi? Nickel-and-dime your customers much? The icing on the cake was a Saturday night visit to the hotel bar for a drink. Two singles of blended scotch (the cheap stuff) started at $11/drink before tax, and ended up at nearly $30 after a modest tip was added. $30 for two drinks? Booooo.

<comment category="negative" id="UR121788116">We got a last minute deal at this 4 star hotel, and while the room itself was very nice, we were not very satisfied with our experience. It was a bit of a walk from the downtown core, the hotel parking costs were double that of a 3 1/2 star hotel, and there was an extra charge for wifi in our room. It was a busy weekend, and it took forever to get anywhere in the elevators (there are 6) due to long waits for an elevator, then to multiple stops on each trip. In addition, our car had to be valet-parked offsite as it was "overheight" (it was over 6'2"), and they left it on the street outside the hotel entrance for over 5 hours at night as they were "very busy" and "hadn't had time to take it" over to to other garage. IT only got moved after we brought it to their attention.

Room service was prompt and delivered with a good attitude. I thought it was a good value for the relatively low price I paid. It's a couple extra blocks away than other major hotels from tourist sites like Pike, space needle, and the waterfront, but it was convenient for my work near Pioneer Square.

<comment category="negative" id="UR121680235">My wife and I stayed here for a random Saturday night out of the house getaway. Everything at the hotel was great when it comes down to amenities and cleaniness. The location of the property is not as great as some of the other dowtown hotels if you are looking to go out shopping or out to the bars at night. The east side of the building borders the I-5 so it could get noisy on some of the lower floors. Their roof top lounge also has a great Happy Hour menu and is a good place to just hang out, have a couple of drinks, and to watch Seattle from the top. That being said I would totally reccomend this hotel to other travelers until we checked out of this property. Right after we left downtown, my wife realized she forgot her hair conditioner that she just picked up at a salon the night before. She called the operator and was told that the room hasn't been cleaned yet and that they'll send a security guard up there to pick it up for us. Once we came back with in 30 minutes of the call I went up to the front desk to pick it up, the attendant seemed to know right away what I was talking about and flat out told me that the room has been cleaned and they had nothing for me.... I asked what would housekeeping do with a huge 1.25 L bottle of conditioner, that's hard to miss, he said he wouldn't know and he did not let me go upstairs and check out the room to see if maybe they missed it. He did not seem to care about my concern at all, and he caused me to have a bad "after taste" from staying here. I don't think we will ever consider staying here again, or even come up to the RView for drinks. I would hate to forget something of value here...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR121476601">Wow, their are so many positive reviews, sadly my experience was quite the opposite,here goes... 1. To begin with $30 parking fee - No issues paying it, BUT, if I am paying I expect to be able to park there! We were there on a Saturday and there was an event so the hotel opens up the parkade to daily parkers in addition to hotel guests. Due to this we could not find any parking after going in circles for 15-20mins. We let the valet know the situation and they said they would take the car for us which helped at that time. We did speak to the manager about this and about the parkade safety since they had cars all over the place including on the ramp (which was a major safety hazard since we almost got hit twice ) The manager waived our parking fees and gave us the whole I understand speech (that is why I rated the hotel 2 stars, the customer service shown by the manager) 2. The beds in this hotel were by far horrible, for lack of a better word the beds were ``springy`` I have stayed at other Marriotts but never had beds like this. To boot the pillows were very very hard. Did not get a good night sleep at all! 3. The hot tub jets were not working and the front desk claimed to not have known about this, which was odd since there was a sign stating that they did not work. Spoke to a housekeeping employee and they mentioned that the hot tub had been like that for sometime. Overall it was a horrible experience and I would never stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120429068">From the moment we walked in, we were rather impressed with the service. We had high floor and quiet room. The room met our expectations for a usual 4 to 5 star hotel. But I would rate this hotel at most 4 star aiming (but not there yet) to be a 5 star. You can tell there isn't enough thought put into the room amenities e.g. no disposable room slippers, and no kettle! The bar fridge was empty too. Internet cost extra so was a bummer unless you go to the lobby. Hotel was updated but not everything e.g. lifts are still quite old, light switches in the room is also the old type. Sofa in the room also did not look like the new funky type. Parking at hotel is expensive but you can do free street parking at night but do remember to remove it or pay for it from 8 am - they are rather punctual and strict about it. Rather inconvenient in you need to go to the corner store (convenience store) for anything at night because the closest one is like 5 blocks away. Hotel would suit more the business type but if you're on vacation and can get a good deal, would highly recommend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120426993">the lack of customer service I have received from this hotel about cancelling my reservation, within 12 hours of booking through another site is shocking. The other site (that will also get a well deserved review) has put the entire blame on the hotel who has done absolutely nothing to defend themselves. For a hotel that claims they are 4 stars, their service sure isn't. stay tuned for my reviews once I have actually stayed there as the treatment I have received so far is appalling.

<comment category="positive" id="UR120359148">I stayed at the Renaissance Seattle for a long weekend with my mom and sister. The hotel is a classy property that appears geared toward the business traveler. The hotel was clean with nice amenities, including Aveda products. We enjoyed a visit to the lounge one evening. The hotel's location made it an easy walk to many popular downtown venues. The big downside: the beds. We had a room with 2 double beds, beds that should not be shared. The mattresses in our room were certainly in need of replacing. But overall, and certainly considering the excellent rate we had received, it was a good downtown hotel choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR120345937">My experience at the hotel I would describe as average and not a 4 star rating that priceline might suggest, thus I was slightly disappointed. Overall the hotel property is okay and for being in downtown Seattle the price I paid on priceline was a bargain $115/night. The inhouse workout room and nice treadmills and a full set of dumbells, however the other workout machines needed repair, gym was small. Pool had stong smell of chlorinates. *Internet should have been free, for $13/night, it was s-l-o-w. *Parking was tight and expensive $30night for self park (however compared to parking elsewhere this is probably standard fee. *access to I-5 was convenient *Maxwells restuarant had nice breakfast buffet, 3 newspapers to pick from and a very friendly staff. *Overall staff was very helpful, friendly and actually seemed to enjoy their work. Rooms were clean and diligent housekeeping service. *tv picture in room was not HD, small channel selection In my opinion this is a value property if you can get it through priceline, however add $43/night to compare with another facility ( if you get free internet and parking).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120315755">The hotel was conveniently located, walking distance to all areas of downtown Seattle. The room was a touch on the small side. The bed was comfortable. There was an empty bar fridge included which was nice. Most hotels provide a fridge full of overpriced goods. No complimentary slippers. In downtown Seattle parking is free on Sundays, but the spots are taken up quickly. We stayed Sat &amp; Sun night, we paid $8.00 to park from 6PM to 8PM Sat nite while spots were available. On Sun nite we prepaid $8.00 to park from 8AM to 10AM on Mon. The result was $16.00 to park from 6PM Sat to 10AM Mon. This saved approximately $45.00 in parking. Ask for a room away from the Interstate. Ask for a room on a lower floor (6th), this will allow you to use the complimentary wireless internet provided in the lobby saving $12 or so per day (ask the front desk for the password).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR120290714">The hotel has a very nice design and look to it. My husband and I went for a conference at the hotel. Our room didn't have as many cable channels so being alone in the room at night while he was at a meeting, I didn't enjoy the choices. Also the bed was horrible. We had a king sized bed and both of us slept horribly. Our over 20 year old mattress at home was nicer! The workout room on the top floor was really nice with good equipment. I ate at their restaurant for breakfast which was good and not too expensive. They didn't have a shuttle bus to or from the airport, but luckily for us we had a friend drive us.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119945950">The Seattle Renaissance is a fine hotel for the business traveler. It is clean, comfortable, and centrally located to downtown businesses. However, if you are a tourist, I would suggest finding a hotel that is cheaper, offers free wi-fi and breakfast, and doesn't involve a steep hill. (Although the latter seems to be a given in Seattle -- it feels like everything is uphill both ways!) Overall this hotel is great if someone else (like your company) is footing the bill. If it's your own dime, I am sure you can find clean, comfortable and a central location for less.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119923147">As people have described, right off the highway in front of a one way street. In terms of hotels, very comparable to the Westin and Sheraton. Location Not much around the hotel, except for the highway and a Bartell Drugs 2 blocks down on 4th avenue. This huge store is a great place to get almost anything you need (snacks, toys, toiletries, organic milk!). And yes, it is a steep hill down to the water, so watch out when it's raining because it can get slippery! Pike Market is 15-20 minute walk away, all down hill. The Sheraton is about 10-15 minutes away to Market, so just a tad closer. When you're coming back to the hotel from the Market, definitely go up Pike Street to avoid the steep incline, it's more gradual (turn right on 6th avenue to hit the hotel). It's a pleasant walk through City Center with all its shops and restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, HMV, Ross, etc). Definitely on the outskirts of downtown, it'll be a walk to hit the popular areas. If you want to be right in the middle of the action as soon as you leave the front door, stay at the Sheraton. We didn't mind the location. Parking As with all other hotels in Seattle, you pay for it. Self park is in a secure garage (in and out privileges with your room key- all automated) is $30 plus tax ($36 total). One night we overheard that self parking was full and only valet was available. The garage seemed secure enough. Plus, there's one elevator (kind of small) that takes you straight up to the lobby. Check In Smooth, accepted my request for a room away from the highway as per other posts suggestions. Room Located on the 15th floor, views of the apartment building across from us. Good people watching. They had their blinds open, so we could see them making dinner, watching tv, etc. Nice apartments! Good size, comparable with Westin and Sheraton. Very nice decor, modern dark woods. Flat screen TV. We requested 2 doubles. Bathroom was standard sized, very clean. We liked the Aveda products. Unfortunately no free Wi-Fi. Beds were fine, no major complaints. Lobby Live band Friday night in the lounge area. Packed with people. Concierge was nice, let us borrow an umbrella. Overall Good hotel. Quality of room and hotel is good, on par with other 4 star hotels in the area. Only thing is that you're a bit far from the action. If you're ok with that, then this place is totally fine. We wouldn't mind staying here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119868007">The staff is really cordial and polite. If you stay here ask for a room that does not face te highway, because the windows are a single glass and it might be very noisy, specially during week mornings. The rooms are ok, but nothing extraordinary. If you have breakfast, maybe choose of the menu. The buffet has a lack of options and not as well prepared. Maybe choose somewhere else for the same rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119570037">I was able to secure three rooms at this hotel via Priceline.com for about $100 ea. on a Thursday night. For a full service hotel in downtown Seattle I thought this was an excellent bargain. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The location is convenient and and easy walk to many attractions, museums and restaurants. I personally had a room on the 8th floor and thought that there was a bit too much road noise coming from the street. If I ever go back, I will ask for a higher floor. The bar on the 28th floor has an amazing view on a clear night. You don't want to miss it!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119537982">This is one of the more dilapidated and rundown Renaissance hotels that I have stayed in. The hotel feels more like a mid-tier level than what one would expect from one of the flagship Marriott properties. If you are paying full price (i.e. not Priceline, Hotwire, etc.)...look somewhere else. Personally, for $150+/night, I would recommend the Sheraton. Like other reviewers have noted, the Renaissance is not exactly convenient to most of the downtown attractions. The hotel is up on a hill about 5-6 blocks from the closest attraction. Its not horrible...but the Sheraton and others are closer. I got this hotel via Priceline...and I felt that the Priceline price was more acceptable given the rundown condition of the hotel. The Renaissance lacks a dedicated lobby entrance (i.e. place to pick up taxis, etc.) and I felt every time I went outside for a taxi was an adventure in and of itself. Be prepared to be hit up by "private" limos instead of the usual taxis. I made this mistake...once. You will not get a good deal with the private car. It almost feels like the parking staff out front is getting a kick back. As others have noted...this hotel has to have the oldest elevators known to mankind. Seriously...I thought I was on the Tower of Terror ride at Disney. My room was adequate but nothing special. This is a good Priceline hotel...but spend your full $ at a location closer to downtown attractions with amenities more fitting the price.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119487034">I should begin this review by saying that the frontline staff (from front desk, to bell hop, to wait staff) have been wonderful. My displeasure has much more to do with the food and amenities which just aren't up to Renaissance standards. The rooms themselves are very nice -- lots of easily accessible outlets, remodeled and clean bathrooms, linens etc. Complaint 1: the breakfast in either the restaruant or the consierge lounge is really meager. Today the buffet included: scrambled eggs, waffle quarters, bacon/sausage, oatmeal and potatoes, yogurt, pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, sandwich bread for toasting and some pastries. Cheerios or cornflakes. That's it. Seattle is a rather international city. Where is the salmon? Where is the European style cold cuts? Is it not possible to find higher quality bread? (The concierge lounge was worse. The only protein there were hard boiled eggs). I know this sounds like I'm spoiled, but I've stayed at a significant number of Renaissance hotels in the past year: Milan, Zurich, Las Vegas, Bankok, etc. and I found all of their breakfast buffets to be mouth watering. This one reminded me of a tired dining hall. Complaint 2: Amenities in the form of exercise room is the other thing lacking. Actually it isn't lacking so much as it has not kept pace with demand. At 5:20 the other morning every single machine was taken! At 6:30 this morning, -- same thing. There are a total of 7 machines (5 treadmills) one elliptical and a bike or stair stepper. Basically the place was bursting at the seams and the poor AC could not keep up. So it was like exercising in a sauna. I have to give them credit for having really nice machines though -- built in TV in each one. On the good side though ,this hotel has a 2 lane lap pool on the 28th floor! Not a common thing.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119415207">I booked this hotel on priceline for $88 a night. For the money I paid, I could not have been more pleased!! However, if I had paid the full price of $150+, I would not have been so happy. The lobby was trendy and relaxing. The staff very friendly and helpful. But when I stepped on the elevator, I became concerned of what I had gotten myself into. The elevators are old and remind me of what you see in a horror movie before the hotel becomes haunted :-) Aside from the lobby, the entire hotel has an old, musty smell. The carpet is frayed along the seems, and the paint needs to be scraped and re-done. The hardware (door handles, hinges, etc) need replacing, as do the windows and window hardware. There was a weird ledge underneath all the windows in my room that just looked tacky. The TV in the bedroom sat on the ledge rather than having a TV stand/armoire...again, tacky. The TVs were LCD flat panels, but had poor quality pictures due to the awful signal they were receiving. It was a shame to have nice TVs but have such poor picture quality. The windows cracked open about 4 inches which let in some nice fresh afternoon air, but had to be closed at night due to the expected downtown noise. Upon check in I requested a room with a nice view of the sound. The man at the front desk upgraded me to a King Corner Suite! I was surprised considering I had booked my room through priceline. I certainly can't complain about my room, especially since I only paid $88 a night AND got a free suite upgrade. However, if I had paid full price, I would be quite disappointed in the quality of the room. The TV in the sitting area was not straight and looked as if it was going to fall off the wall. The cables from the TV hung down the wall in a haphazard way. The sofa in the sitting area was not meant to be sat on! It was old, uncomfortable, and just ackward. The suite had a small refrigerator with complimentary bottles of water. It also had a coffe maker with (awful) coffee and a wonderful tea assortment. There was a safe and iron/ironing board. I found it odd that in a king suite they only provided one bath robe, but I'm sure if I had requested another they would have provided it. The bathroom was the most up to date part of the room. It was obvious the majority of their recent renovation budget was focused on the bathrooms. I found it odd that the door was on a sliding track, similar to a pocket door. It provided little privacy from the rest of the room. The tub was small and would have been nice to have a seperate tub and shower instead of a combination. I loved the mirror and lighting in the bathroom!! And the Aveda toiletries were a nice compliment as well. The bed was comfortable, not great, not horrible. The bedroom had a view of the Space Needle, Lake Union, Puget Sound, Qwest and Safeco fields, and in the far distance UW (if you know what you're looking for). :-) Overall, it was a good hotel for the price I paid. The location wasn't great for downtown tourist attractions, but it wasn't horrible either. Don't plan on walking back to the hotel alone after dark, however. There were many questionable people on the streets after dark. It felt a bit out of the tourist area, but still within a 15 minute walk to Pike Place, Benaroya Hall, Game Works, the movie theater, and shopping. There is also a free bus route that runs through downtown. It picks up every half hour right across the street from the hotel! It is best to catch a bus back to the hotel as the walk back is on a significant incline.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119378411">Friendly staff, and generally a good vibe here. Like the concierge right at the door, and he pointed out some good restaurants. Strangeness in the HVAC in the meeting rooms. Sounded like a helicopter landing. This on top of the too-loud incipid hallway music that made its way into the meeting rooms made for some suckage.

<comment category="negative" id="UR119310149">I thought this was a decent hotel. I stayed here with my boyfriend for a weekend getaway. I used hot wire's hot rate for a downtown 4 star hotel, and this is what I got. I wouldn't pay full price for this hotel, but it was ok since I got a deal. I like that they provide Aveda toiletries. Parking is $30 per night and wifi is $13 per night. The pool and hot tub are nothing special, the gets in the hot tub are poorly placed and not very soothing. It is literally right off the highway, I did not notice noise because my room was not on that side of the hotel, but i have heard of others complaining of the noise. It is close enough for younger people to walk to the attractions downtown (we are in our 20s), but it you can't handle hills, then you may want to drive to your attractions. The only reason that I gave this three stars rather than four or five stars is because nothing really WOW-ed me with this stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118979576">The Renaissance is a great looking hotel. Day staff were great, night staff were not very helpful, left me wrestling with two suitcases and a heavy door while they watched from reception desk. Food is good and prices on food and drinks reasonable. The rooms are a problem. If the double glazed windows don't seal properly you might as well sleep outside on the expressway! The noise was dreadful. We were up and out at 5.30am as there was no point staying in the room. They did bring ear plugs when requested but it was all too late for a good night. If you must stay here go and visit your room before you get your bags. We were booked as part of our tour on the way back through Seattle, so the staff were very kind and upgraded our room to a beautiful suite but the first one we went to the windows did not seal and the noise was awful again, so we changed to a different room and it was, not quiet, but we could sleep with it.<topic>none</topic>

I noticed that folks with club access were giving access to the lounge to those who didn't have access. The bell staff and concierge went out of their way to assist. Overall, the staff is well trained and consistently demonstrate a high level of customer service ethic and the property is well maintained. It is well within walking distance to the Market and shopping but a little bit of a hike back due to the incline. I would not hesitate to stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

Of all the similar-type hotels I've stayed in, the level of accomodation and friendliness is outstanding at this Rennaissance- akin to that of a boutique hotel. We even had handwritten thank you notes from the room cleaning staff for our tips! Breakfast is very good and in a pleasant, sun-filled space with exceptional, upbeat servers. An example of this hotel's level of service is that I left a few things in the room when I checked out; when I realized almost a week later that I'd done this, I called them and they located my things (for which they had no responsiblity, of course), then sent them to me back in Boston (thank you, Patricia!).

<comment category="negative" id="UR118544893">Stayed here for four nights and realized it is a poor value and not up to Marriott/Renaissance standards. Poor location, Multi-lane freeway on the east side and high rise buildings on the west side that completely block the view to Puget Sound, and a long downhill-uphill walk to restaurants/shopping. Furniture in the room tired. Flat Screen TV but not high definition, always annoying. Small refrigerator did not work. Poor lighting in bathroom which is good if you don't want a close look at your face. Service very uneven,newspaper outside door on some days not on others, same with evening service to room. No material in room on TV and hotel amenities.Don't plan to eat here because it is difficult to figure out which restaurants are open at what times. If you are a Marriott rewards member, as I am, you will have a much better experience at the Downtown Residence Inn at Lake Union.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118439371">Unlike other reviewers we found this hotel very functional. It is quite plain when you enter the lobby but the staff were really friendly. When we got our room keys we were very pleasantly surprised at the size of it, and the size of the bed! It would have slept 3 people comfortably. There was lots of space to relax and there was a chair with a foot rest. It is downhill from the hotel to the shoreline which means of course, that it is uphill back, but if you walk across another couple of streets and then return, it isn't nearly so steep, and we are in our late 60s, so if we can manage it I don't know what others are whingeing about! The freeway is close by and we could hear it slightly from our room but it didn't disturb us at all. We were also able to buy breakfast in the cafe/restaurant on the second floor and it was very good. The concierge staff were also very helpful especially when we needed to print our boarding passes. So all-in-all, we think this a good hotel for a couple of nights.<topic>none</topic>

Its location, on the edge of downtown, right next to the freeway. If you have a room on that side of the hotel, the noise is easily discernible. The rooms are fine, very much up to Renaissance's standards. However, I won't be back, unless the room deal is too good to pass up. One last note . . . The evening desk jockey is way, way too annoying and discourteous. Witness: After checking in around midnight, I get a call from him at 12:30 a.m., when I'm already in bed, asking about the room. I understand that's what his book tells him he's supposed to do, but 12:30 a.m.? Really?<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118324997">Stayed here for 4 nights for a conference. Hotel staff was extremely knowledgeable of the area and quite professional. I was upgraded to a 2 room suite on the 25th floor upon arrival with access to the club lounge on the 26th floor. The view I had from the 25th floor was amazing. Could see the water front from one window and the Space Needle from the other and what a spectacular sky line Seattle offers at night. This hotel is located about 1/2 a mile from Pikes Place Market the Water Front and the First Starbucks. The walk down is great and when I say down i mean down. Returning to the hotel was straight up hill but worth the effort in my opinion. Despite having complimentary breakfast in the club lounge I did eat one morning in the restaurant and it was a basic buffet or you could order off the menu if you have the time I would recommend walking to the water front to find breakfast. Did have room service one night. A basic Turkey Club with Fries and water. Was about 20.00 including tip so not so bad for room service. I gave the server a couple of extra bucks but he was not expecting it. My only complaint with this hotel was the Elevators seemed to be running slow. Not sure if they were all working or what but it was a small inconvenience. This will definitely be my hotel for future stays in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118178326">Stayed here Sept.3rd thru 6th 2011. I loved this hotel. The lobby was beautiful. The staff was great. Friendly &amp; helpful.Allowed us to check in about 10:00 am.The room was large. Stayed on the 26th floor. A fantastic view ,especially at night.Beds were comfortable, medium firmness. Tv had good selection of stations. Internet was fast enough for watching videos online. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the 2nd floor for 2 days. Outstanding. But I do have 2 complaints. The first is minor. I didn't really care for the bathroom doors. They are made of white glass that you can partially see through (silhouettes). For most people this might not be a problem, but for families or friends sharing a room , it might. Also when someone goes to the bathroom at night ,it lights up the whole room. Plus they are sliding doors. The second complaint is the cost of parking. $30. a day plus $6 &amp; change tax on the parking. This reminds me of the luggage fees that airlines charge. I prefer just to have the full price upfront, please. This hotel is in a good location for walking around the city. But I do recommend going down 6th to Pike to get where you want to go, as it is a lot less steep. Also recommend the Mod Pizza place on 6th for an inexpensive meal. Even with my 2 complaints , I do recommend this hotel. I really enjoyed my time there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118110303">Had a great couple of days in Seattle. Was a break from the work week. Caught the train down from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, Washington. What a great way to relax and enjoy the trip. Fantastic views and easy travel. Arrived in Seattle, and after a minimal taxi fare to our hotel started the trip. As we arrived and everyday after, the staff at this hotel were exceptional. Any questions we had about Seattle and the surrounding area were easily answered. The staff was very friendly , courteous and went out of their way to make sure our stay there was enjoyed. Accomodations were also tops. The restaurant / Bar made dinner and a cocktail and experience as you viewed from the 28th floor a gorgeous city. Can't wait to make a weekend Seahawks/Mariners game now. Pike place was a 15-20 minute walk down the hill and not at all difficult. In fact we walked everywhere and had little or no difficulty with anything. If you get tired the cab fare up to the hotel from the market was again, minor.The walk up the hill could be a bit difficult for elderly patrons, but we learned after the first day to weave up the hill. This introduced us to even more shops and stores and we became more aware of the area. All in all a great trip and a great hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118069743">Stayed at Renaissance for one night on Labor day. The location is very good in downtown Seattle. However, it's on uphill and near the high way. A bit noisy and could be quite a walk to Pike's market etc.. The lobby was very pretty- nice modern style decor. Room is spacious. This is an old hotel but they renovated it. The furniture in room is very modern style, as well as the bathroom. The lady at the check in counter was extremely kind. Enjoyed the style<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118036218">Nice hotel, had everything we needed. The hotel is not close to many shops and such, and not in a busy area, but everything you want is walkable. It was close to the water, pike's market, which is all walking distance. The space needle is also walkable (a bit far probably about 25 minutes, but doable). It is on a hill so the walk does get tiring, - we found that we could walk across and then down the hill if going to the water or pike's market area. This place also has a computer in the lobby to print your flight tickets! Was very excited when I saw this amenity! Very convenient!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117815028">You take a large gamble when you book a room here. Either you will face the busy freeway or you will get lucky and have a quieter room. My first room had two double beds. I had booked a King, so I called for an adjustment. I was re-booked into a King Suite that sat right next to the freeway on the 6th floor. LUCKY ME! I'm exhausted, and now I get to hear the highway traffic all night long. There are wonderful hotel choices in Seattle. Why stay here?!? There are also no restaurants next door that are open past 9 PM on a weekday. I mean, shoot, this is a metropolitan downtown -- any other decent hotel in Seattle will have lots of choices withing walking distance including the Grand Hyatt, where I stayed last time. P.s. The Grand Hyatt has better bathroom amenities and a steam room in their complimentary fitness center. Again, WHY STAY HERE? ! you have a lot of better options<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117758632">Good hotel in Seattle which provided good customer serivce. The hotel is about 8-10 blocks from the water and tourist area's. I wish it were a little closer as within the two block area there were limited choices of entertainment and dining. The room was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable and the desk had plenty of outlets to charge everything. The food at the bar was average and a little below is portion sizes. The beer selection was good and they offered Sam Adams Octoberfest. Overall, I would recommend staying. If I had a choice of a similar hotel closer to the tourist area I would choose that but if not I would stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117726659">I stayed here during a convention, with a discounted price. Every single staff member I encountered at the Renaissance was over-the-top friendly and helpful, and that made the stay memorable. It's a pretty good business-class hotel, not as nice as the Seattle Hyatt or Fairmont, but good enough, with very good food in both restaurants, an adequate health club, a very comfortable bed (but not-so-good sound insulation between rooms), a refrigerator in the room, good lighting in the bathroom and good water pressure in the shower. It is a bit of a hike from the downtown center, and that's a disadvantage for a woman on her own in a city that is not very taxi-oriented.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117713408">This was a decent stay. Rooms were clean, and general expectations met for a Renaissance Hotel stay. Rooms were okay, I stayed in 2 different rooms due to a multi-location week long trip where we used this hotel for two different stays. First room seemed more outdated (10th floor), second room was very nice, and on a corner of the 6th floor. Basic amenities. I give the food a B. Location was good a few blocks up the hill from Pike Place Market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117499120">Stayed here one night prior to a cruise. Took light rail from airport and walked a few blocks to hotel. It is a bit uphill from Univ. stop. Room was very clean and had a mini-fridge which was nice and cold. We went to the Subway about 3 blocks away for dinner. The fitness area was good sized but the next morning it was packed. The pool is tiny but has a great view of the city facing west. Outside of the fitness area to the right was a room/area that was open that had a view facing north. I had heard some people mention the traffic noise - if the a/c is running, you can't hear it, but in the middle of the night when the a/c was off, you certainly did plus the bird that was squaking from somewhere. The staff was friendly enough. The Vikings were staying at our hotel that night prior to the game on Saturday so there were some groupies outside but they were well confined to a certain area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117461671">Admitting, we didn't spend much time in our hotel, and the Renaissance (pretty much) did everything right. We arrived early Friday morning, fresh off a cruise ship and ready to drop off our luggage and freshen up. Fortunately, a room was available. It was nice enough. The bed was very comfy. The chairs and TV were fine. I could do without the sliding/non-latching bathroom door. The concierge was helpful, providing us with a map and suggestions tailored to our limited time and list of sights to see, even printing directions for us to get to one out of the way restaurant. Getting around from the hotel wasn't terribly difficult, though it is in somewhat of a bad location. If you're walking up Madison, the road is very steep uphill. The sites (Pike's Market, Space Needle) are further north, though, so we took the concierge's recommendation to walk down 6th a few blocks to minimize the slope. There are a number of similar hotels closer to all the sites, but the Renaissance was still accessible enough on foot or by bus. Our only real complaint came when housekeeping awakened us at 8:30. We were checking out that day! Why would we need our room made up? We weren't planning on sleeping in too much longer, so it didn't really ruin our day. We booked through Hotwire, spending more than we wanted to, but ultimately, I think it was worth not having to shlep in from outside of town (45 minute train from the much cheaper airport hotels) since we didn't have a ton of time to see everything.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117329297">During a six day business trip during which a group of eight stayed at the Seattle Renaissance I was completely impressed with the hotel, the room, the food, the service and the whole experience. The room was modern, clean and focused. My room had a nice view of a piece of Seattle (not a panorama -- but a great feeling of being in the city). All eight people on the trip statedpositive comments about their hotel room. A open-area (not walled in but flowed around a corner) restaurant on the lobby area served amazing food -- or you can stop for drinks or good wine. The same area is used in the morning by people for coffee, reading the newspaper or computer time. Very inviting. Service was perfect every time. A favorite small detail of myself and many of my co-workers was a very large table in the lobby/restaurant area at which one could pull up to a piece of it and use as desk or for computer. People would be sitting at different parts of it that did not know each other. Comfortable. I once worked there for about three hours and it was pleasant not being stuck in a room working. The staff were consistently very helpful and very nice. The hotel is walking distance (15 minutes at least) to the famous Pier area and shopping, restaurants, and other attractions. I will stay at this hotel again when I return on business. A general observation -- I have had many consistent and positive experiences at Renaissance hotels in the past two years -- especially in service and food. Our favorite part<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117286003">This is a pretty normal hotel for downtown and the price - nice amenities - pool, bar, cafe, resturant. Beware- it is easily accessible from Interstate 5 but on a very steep hill - do not plan to walk anywhere from the hotel. There is downtown bus - be sure to ask since no one will give you the information. No breakfast, no coffee included - be prepared to pay for everything including overpriced Starbucks ( my husband loves Satrbucks - your card is no good and the prices are very high)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117250267">We stayed here 2 nights before going on a Princess Cruise to Alaska. I thought the rate was kinda steep (I think we paid $200 a night) The breakfast was good and the employees that work there were so kind and helpful. The enclosed pool/spa was nice on the top floor with a great view. Our room didn't have a memorable view. Our toilet overflowed the 2nd night. (Note to self- alway s wear flip flops or slippers in hotel rooms, you don't know whats been on the carpet.) We changed rooms with help from the bell hop. It's a large hotel and you have to wait a while for the elevators. There is a bus 1 or 2 blocks away that goes straight to the Princess terminal, which is quite far. The bus is 1.50, much cheaper than a taxi.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117159817">We are a couple in our 40's. Stayed for 2 nights. Went to Pike Place, Space Needle, EMP, and various malls and restaurants. Getting around by bus/monorail is very easy. City buses (not monorail) are free until 7pm in the downtown area. Bus stops are located across the street. Go to concierge to get a map and have all this explained to you. Taking the bus is great if walking up and down the hill is a problem. The Renaissance --- Pro's: - Clean, modern room - Great location - Friendly and helpful concierge - Easy check in/out - Booked through Priceline ($128/night) - Comfortable beds - Good toiletries (Aveda) Cons: - Some traffic noise, but it didn't bother us. - Pool was closed. Note, that it is fairly small. - Bathroom door is a sliding frosted panel door, not a pocket door... this door slides from the outside so not exactly very "private". - The two bottles of water in the mini-fridge aren't free. Not knowing... I drank two bottles, but the charges were removed from our bill no problem. - Hotel Parking - $37 (incl tax). - Street parking $4/hour, free after 8pm We arrived at the hotel around 8pm (spent the day at Premium Outlet) - we parked on the street free overnight then moved the car to the hotel parking the next morning for one night. Worked out great to only have to pay for one night of parking! All in all, I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117062124">We had an early morning flight into SeaTac, so brought our luggage to the hotel for storage until check-in. While there, we checked on our reservation and the woman working the front desk first looked surprised that there were three of us, in spite of the fact that the reservation specified three people in a room with two double beds, then said that a room might not be available to accommodate us as the hotel was full. When we asked for clarification, she informed us in an irritated voice that because we had reserved through Orbitz, we were only guaranteed a room and not necessarily the number and types of beds in the room we had specified. Okay, I understand that airlines and hotels overbook because, yes, people flake. However, it is not okay for a staff member to treat paying guests, even those paying a slightly lower rate (the discount's not THAT good), poorly, particularly when their standard practices are what cause the problems in the first place. The desk person in the afternoon who actually checked us into our rooms was more amicable and helpful, and she didn't try to pass the buck when she accidentally checked us into the wrong room. The Renaissance needs to do a better job at training their staff in customer service, or at least hiring people who are service-minded. Other than the inconsistencies with the front desk personnel, the rooms were clean and outfitted in a simple, modest, tailored style. Linens were crisp and comfortable, although I wouldn't buy them for my own home, in spite of the fact that the handy little order forms in the room made it easy to do so. A minor annoyance: the shower curtain liner, rather than being attached by the rings on the rod, attached to the curtain a third of the way down via plastic snaps. I'm guessing it's to make them easier to remove and replace for washing, but the plastic snaps didn't hold very well and the curtain kept unsnapping. A pet peeve: internet access costs extra, unless I want to hover around the conference areas. Bottom line: the Renaissance is updated and clean, but they have not gone the extra mile with regard to amenities or small touches to make it exceptional, and inconsistencies in customer service quality make it fall short of very good.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116362112">This is probably going to be one of my most uninspired reviews so far, because the Renaissance was just so that - uninspiring. Let's see...where to begin? The price. Because we are cheap, we booked through Priceline's NYOP and it was the Renaissance that accepted our bid @ $125/night + taxes and fees. Because this was a July weekend, this was about the best deal we could get for a 4* hotel (which, by the way, I would classify this as NOT). The location. The hotel is on Madison between 5th and 6th. This is not a part of the city where I would prefer to be because there is not a lot going on in the immediate vicinity. I have stayed in other hotels in Seattle that are not just more central but also closer to a variety of restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. That said, most of the major attractions are still within walking distance, but be aware that the hotel is on a steep hill, and climbing that hill could conceivably get annoying and tiring pretty quickly. The room. The room we were given was one on the 16th floor that faced the I-5. It was looking a bit tired, but was of an adequate size. While the bed was not the most comfortable bed I have slept in, it was perfectly fine. Some reviewers have complained about the freeway noise, but this did not bother us at all. It was hardly noticeable to us as soon as we closed the window. The bathroom. The bathroom was of a good size, and it was clean. The water pressure in the shower was good, and the water was hot. The toiletries provided were also of a good quality (Aveda). The service. I can't really say much about this because the lady who checked us in barely said more than a few words to us. She just asked for a piece of ID and a credit card, gave us the keys to our room, and asked if we needed a map. She was neither rude nor friendly. She was just very...robot-like. Etcetera. 1. Self-parking is approx $30/day + taxes of almost $7, which is pretty ridiculous. I did see a parking garage on 5th and Madison that charges $24/day, but I am not sure if it is even accessible 24 hrs/day. 2. In-room wifi is available for a charge, but there is free wi-fi in the lobby. 3. I would have liked to have had a drink in the lounge on the 28th floor, but it was closed on a Sunday, which was quite disappointing to say the least. Would I stay here again? Not if I can help it. I say this primarily because of where it is situated, and because I feel that there are better options in Seattle. I would not go and purposely book the Renaissance, and if I ever bid on Priceline again, I would probably cross my fingers and hope to god that a hotel other than this accepts my bid.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116317706">I stayed here with my wife for 5 nights. We actually live an hour away but my company was having meetings in Seattle so it was much easier to stay at the hotel. It is a short walk to great shopping and many attractions along with a wide variety of eateries. In fact, our group of 40 people (maybe 70 total including husbands and wives) did not have one bad meal and we are pretty selective eaters. The weather was fantastic. Wear walking shoes!!!! If you are not a kid the streets from the hotel are tough on the knees due to the steep downhill incline and tough on the calves coming back uphill. The meeting room we had was very good.

Our room was clean and very comfortable; well appointed - 2 queens beds, 31 inch flat screen TV, desk, chair with ottoman, side table, fridge, etc. Beds were great and the view from our bedroom was really beautiful. A big bonus was to have Aveda shampoo and body products, too. We are Plat. members so had free internet, etc. We had access to club lounge for breakfast, afternoon apps/drinks and a nice evening dessert bar.

My flight was late and didn't get to the hotel until around 2am. I wanted one thing -- to be lying in a comfortable bed. I appreciated this hotel for several reasons - its right off I5 - just a couple of turns and you are parked and checking in; the staff was excellent - always helpful and informative; the location is great - walking distance to Pike Place and all of that fun riff-raff; the lounge at the top of the hotel was quiet and comfortable with a great view (I'm a gold member so this probably doesn't apply to everyone); the queen bed was really comfortable; the room was quiet - your mileage may vary I was in Seattle for a conference and booked some of my meetings in the lounge. That worked out perfectly, as it was private enough, there was coffee service and ample seating area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115920040">Don't get me wrong, the Renaissance (a Marriott Hotel) is classy, amply staffed and rich in amenities. The location is excellent if you plan on visiting the court house or the former Bank of America Tower. If not, you might be better off few blocks North of here. It's worth paying the minimal fee to upgrade to club level, the free breakfast you get in return is stellar. Having a pool on the top level is pretty cool (there are even adjacent restrooms with showers, which is nice). The pool, however ,literally had algae growing in the southwest corner during my stay and the pool deck was always dangerously slick. The club level offers excellent resources for tourists and a concierge is present to assist with planning outings, scoring event tickets, etc. In room decor is pretty typical, elegant but not particularly innovative or worthy of mention.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115406335">Not the Renaissance I expected. First, the concierge was worthless. one morning I simply asked for a pack of matches.... simply hotel request, right? I was "educated" by this guy that the hotel was a smoke free property and that the hotel did not provide any matches. Keep in mind the hotel gift shop sells cigarettes and there are two smoking areas on the property. Good thing I didn't ask for anything important like a taxi or dinner reservations! I mentioned it to the front desk and ..... guess what...... more grief! More explanation, more defensiveness. So much for customer service from the renaissance. Second, the property is directly located on I-5, sixteens lanes of bustling traffic right in front of the hotel. How much relaxation do you think you're gonna get on your vacation or during your business trip? Third, the Renaissance is an old structure. Recent renovations are obvious.... a little too obvious. They really cut corners to save a dime, where hinged doors once were, cheap sliding doors now cover the bathrooms-problem is there are large gaps.... you really want a bathroom door to close, completely.... right? There are still signs of the old building: smelly old carpet, formica counter-tops. There are many wonderful hotels in Seattle, this is not one of them.<topic>none</topic>

The water in our room would not hold a consistent temp (going from warm to scalding hot, to tepid, then back to warm). The front desk was apologetic, and agreed to a breakfast voucher for 2, but only after I asked. Breakfast buffet at the restaurant in the hotel was just decent.

The room was clean and smelled fresh when I entered...this is GOOD and I what I expect every time but don't always get at all hotels. I was on a fairly high floor (16th) and had a view of both the freeway and a "sliver" of a water view. When I visited the bar on the 28th floor that had a nice view which included the Space Needle. I found the staff friendly and helpful. I ate only one meal at the hotel, breakfast, and it was adequate, wouldn't go there if I had time to go outside...Seattle has so many good restaurants that it's easy to be a food snob here. Worked out in the hotel gym...it was small, got a little crowded. On the other hand it was clean, had plenty of clean towels and all the patrons were polite to one another I will stay again because I do business with a company that uses this property...but would not rush to come back on my own.

<comment category="positive" id="UR108575212">Stayed at the Renaissance Hotel during the Easter weekend with a friend. Booked a double room with 2 beds. On arrival we were told all the two bed - rooms were sold out (due to a anime convention in Seattle I would guess) so they offered to upgrade us to a junior suite (Corner King Guest Room) with a king bed and we had no problem with that. Us girls don't mind sharing a big bed. The room was spacious, cozy and clean - no complaints there. Room was on 11th floor. Some traffic noise yes, but we slept like babies because we were tired from all the shopping and walking around. Loved the bed! The breakfast buffet was good. Ok selection of warm and cold breakfast foods. On second morning (Sun) there was an omelette bar, but we didn't try it. If you go to breakfast around 10am you might have to wait for a table for a bit. We got a table right away on both mornings there, but on the second morning we got the last available table, so the people who came after us, had to wait for one, but it didn't take long. The service at the Renaissance was brilliant. The maid slipped a card under the door on our first morning when we had the "little privacy please" sign on the door, asking us to inform her when we would like to have our room serviced. We saw her when we left for breakfast and asked her when she might have time to do our room. She offered to do it right away, while we were out having breakfast, even though she was in the middle of cleaning the room next door. The person who gets top marks from us is Richard, who greeted us at the front desk when checking in and out. We absolutely adored him. He was always so friendly and helpful towards us - he e.g. helped us change our bus reservation to an earlier departure time on Sunday morning, when we were leaving back to Vancouver. Such a lovely guy!! The location of the hotel was ok in our mind. You had to walk a bit though to get to Pike Place Market for example, but if you don't mind walking it's a good location (about 5 blocks from Pike St.). BUT note that the hotel is located on a massive(!!) hill so if you're in a crappy shape (like I am ;D) you will have a hard time climbing that loooong steep hill back to the hotel after a days shopping and walking around downtown. Just bear that in mind :D But all in all we had a really lovely stay and we would definitely go back to Renaissance hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR108106392">Stayed at this hotel during our family vacation to Seattle/Vancouver area for 2 nights. Overall the hotel is not bad consider the fact that we got a good deal to stay there for 2 nights during our trip. The hotel is nice and spacious, the room was spacious as well, clean and the beds were very soft and comfy. We ate out at the upstairs restaurant for dinner the second night, the food was not so bad but could've been much better. The service was supar and there was nobody to greet us for few minutes. I would expect better service for this type quality hotel or restaurant. I can see why the place looked empty. If you are here for a family trip, this place is somewhat close to the shopping and restaurants area nearby. However, it is not the most convenient place to stay due to the uphill climb if you are out of shape. My kids were complaining due to the walking and the shops/restaurants is a good 10 minutes away which is not so bad. I would stay at the Red Lion hotel which was our second leg of the trip, a much better location, when you step out of Red Lion, you will be with the crowd and all the coffee shops and stores and the mall too. Overall, I would rate this a 3 star, would probably not stay here next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR108004603">It's not often I stay at a hotel and don't have some suggestion on how they can improve. The Renaissance Hotel in Seattle was seamless. Great staff, great food, enough lifts, well equipped room, comfortable beds. It'd be easy to take this for granted, but it's so often not delivered that when it is right, it deserves recognition. They took great care of our delegation - I'd definitely stay again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR104364410">We stayed at this hotel for one Friday night. The location is excellent for access to Seattle's downtown shopping and attractions. We experienced the best hotel staff I've encountered in years! The front desk (checking in and checking out), room service and maid service. Just outstanding, friendly, helpful people. The rooms are not super large, but plenty big enough for 2 people.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR104279902">It's hard to find anything wrong with this hotel. The location is perfect - everything in downtown is within walking distance and the hotel is magnificent. The only complaint I have is this hotel has taken to the same habits other large hotels chains have - "additional charges" - parking is expensive at 35/day plus tax and wireless internet is 13/day plus tax. This was not a surprise as the man at the front desk was very clear about it, but why don't they figure these expenses into the regular rate? Outside of that, the hotel is probably the nicest I've stayed in - the bed was comfy, elevators are really quick, and the front desk staff is very accommodating - I had to leave around 4am and still was encountered with a friendly response.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102991445">We bid $79 for this hotel on Priceline so we got a good value for sure. A lot of people complain about the parking charges, but all of the downtown hotels charge for this. You have to factor it into the price. The room was very comfortable and quiet (we had a city view room) and the Aveda toiletries were a nice touch. Our room did have an adjoining door, and as we had kids with us, we checked with the front desk to see if the room was occupied - it was empty, so it made us feel a bit better about the (fairly minor) noise our kids made. The pool has a beautiful view of the city. Kids loved it! . I did like the coffee bar setup they have in the lounge in the morning. Easy way to grab a Starbucks and a light breakfast. The only downside to this property is that it is a fair walk from the downtown core and Pike Place. We usually stay at the Warwick which is not as luxurious, but has a brilliant location. All in all, great value for the price paid!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR101912941">My husband and I love weekend trips and decided to go for luxury this time. I wasn't impressed at all. First, they hit you with a $30/night parking fee and explain if you don't like it, just move your car to the street. The rooms were just large bedrooms. Nothing of elegance at all. There was nothing really wrong, I just didn't think it was special.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR100220085">We are frequent visitors to Seattle. Once or twice per month I take my teenage daughter for shopping and mother-daughter quality time together. This time, I booked our hotel through Hotwire for $88 (including fees and taxes $108). It was described as 4 star hotel close to Pike Place and shopping. It was not as close to Pike Place as stated on the website but about 10-15 mins walking distance. I believe everything in Seattle downtown is walking distance. Luckily, we do not mind walking. Conveniently located on Madison st and 6th Ave, and right off of the freeway so we should not navigate through the downtown traffic. We stayed at this hotel one Saturday night. The check-in was fast and receptionist was very friendly. The lobby was spacious, modern and nicely decorated. We got a room on the 16th floor with freeway and city view. The room was spacious, as well, with two comfortable double beds, nice modern decorations and was very clean. Amenities included mini-fridge, flat screen TV, desk with Internet connection for a daily rate of $13 and complimentary coffee-tea station. I tried both caf and decaf coffee â€“ very good roasted coffee. I really liked the idea of one-time use coffee holders. It was very neat. With 5 or 6 types of different sweeteners, I was a little bit disappointed to not find just regular brown sugar. Good coffee deserves something better than sweetener. The restroom was also modern and clean. Shampoo/soap/conditioner were of decent quality. The only thing lacking were the shower caps. I am in love with swimming, so immediately I went to check on their swimming pool. The pool, whirlpool and fitness center are located on 28th floor. The fitness center has cardiovascular equipment, weights, and treadmills, and was mostly deserted. The pool to my disappointment was not deep enough. Max depth was 48â€� or so. One can walk but not swim. The whirlpool was full, so I did not try either of them. We didn't try any of the hotelâ€™s lounges or restaurants, so I cannot quote on their bar or restaurants. I found only 2 downsides of this hotel: 1. Parking. $30 for self-parking (with taxes $36) per night. Parking is narrow and has limited spaces, I found one empty spot almost at the very end. Parking in Seattle on the weekends is free starting Saturday after 6pm. I saw a couple of free parking spots right under my window. So it really is possible to find free parking close to this hotel (if you are staying on the weekend, of course). 2. Thin walls. We had a very noisy couple and I was embarrassed to hear it in front of my daughter. In general we enjoyed our short stay in this hotel and definitely will stay again.

<comment category="negative" id="UR100162549">We have stayed at this hotel before. It is a nice hotel, with a nice upper floor restaurant and lounge. The food was delicious, I believe a little over priced for such small portions. The room itself is nice enough. We self parked in the garage of the hotel. It cost $30 per night. We could have had the valet park for the same cost. I do not think the room or the hotel is nice enough to pay $60 in parking. I realize this is the going rate, but the hotel should maybe have specials with parking included for guests fo the hotel. We will not be staying her any time soon<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR99948075">This hotel was very elegantly designed. It is definitely more upscale than many in its price range. The 28th floor restaurant/bar was lovely and surprisingly quiet, meaning that it was easy to have a conversation. There is a small but sufficient pool and hot tub also on the 28th floor, as well as a decent sized fitness room. The room was actually more of a suite- small living room with desk/couch, then tiny "hallway" with bathroom (good counter space) and lovely bedroom with large corner windows. Although the rooms were tiny, they were more than sufficient for a single business traveler. Everything was BEAUTIFULLY decorated and finished, and very clean and well-kept. The only downside to the bedroom was the HORRIBLE and CONSTANT freeway noise (even from the 9th floor!). The breakfast buffet (for a charge) in the restaurant was decent. The French toast was WONDERFUL! The one downside was the horrible parking garage! It was very difficult to find a spot, and even more difficult to find a working elevator from the garage to the lobby. We ended up walking up 4 flights of stairs just to get to the lobby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR99434986">Found a great package here that included free parking or free breakfast. We took the first as parking in these hotels can be pretty spendy and there are plenty of breakfast places around. Got ourselves a small room with a king sized bed up on the 15th floor. I don't like noise so they found me a nice little spot even away from the street. Fairly quiet except for sirens periodically despite that. Other issues no free wifi, and in this day and age it feels like you are being slighted. They also had one of those 1 coffee cup machines in your room with, only 1 coffee filter.. so one of us had coffee in the morning anyway. Very clean and the decor fairly updated. The lobby is absolutely huge and beautiful. There are 3 restaurants (one is cafe) in the building which is also convenient. The food presentation was wonderful and the crabcakes were chock full of crab! The building goes up to the 28th floor and the view (also name of the lounge) is truly spectacular. The gym is also located on the 28th floor so you get a nice view while you are working out and lots of new machines as well as a swimming pool and a hot tub. That night of the wedding though they were packed in the swimming and hot tub area. All in all a decent place though we did run into a snafu in that they had a large wedding party that affected the parking and so when we got back from our evening we could not park actually for "free" in their garage. We ended up having to find a spot on the street instead.<topic>none</topic>

Normally because the =y charge for internet, I would only give 3 stars, but the deal they gave me included free parking or breakfast for 2 as a added bobnus, so for this review i will up the review to 4 stars. i would stay there again on my next visit<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR96819259">This hotel is not a 4 star. Priceline is passing off as a 4 star but it's no better than 3 star. got it for $99/night. it's far from pike place. Parking $40 per day, disgusting. If you're going on the weekend, parking on the street is FREE all day Sunday!! there was a lot up the street for $10. You're probably better off just parking on the street and if you get a ticket it'll probably be less than $40 anyways. lol. you can probably get the sheraton or westin pike place on hotwire for $89 per night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR96085514">I choose this hotel as I had a friend staying here as well. On whole the stay was super. The staff treated me with class. Every interaction was professional. I am in a wheelchair so dealing with the hill meant using cabs. BTW Seattle finally has accessible taxis, for most of the time I lived in Seattle there weren't any and you to rely on Metro. The food at the hotel was superb, I had a marvelous burger and the clam chowder was super. I was served by room service and the staff was gracious at all times. The Laundry svc was great as they did a short notice pair slacks in and back in four hours! A note on the accessible rooms. I stayed in a dbl queen and king and they both were a bit narrow between the desk and front of the bed. The bathrooms were large but lacked sufficient grab bars at the tub and toilet. Made transferring very difficult and unsafe. In addition I would upgrade the bath seats to sturdier models. I would return as I loved the beds they were an oaisis! I will stay again overall a great time. Loved the art in the lobby bar and the great photos in the rooms.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR95782996">I went through Priceline, name your own price. It selected this hotel. The price was fair at best. The hotel charges $30.00 per night for self parking, $13. Per day for internet per computer. I did opt for a $20.00 per night upgrade once I checked in "for a better room/view". The view was OK, nothing great. After all the fee's, parking, etc. I could have stayed at a nicer hotel that was closer to the attractions I wanted to see. The staff, not including the front desk was very nice and accommodating. The front desk staff was just doing their job, no emotions and did not really did not care if I was satisfied or not. To sum this up, be careful on Priceline and the downtown area. Priceline rated this hotel as 4 stars, it is not 4 stars maybe 2.5 at best. Its old and needs to be updated. Prior to arriving in Seattle we were in Vancouver BC and stay at a Coast Hotel property (Coal Coast Harbor" and it was an excellent hotel and excellent staff. Seattle does have a Coast Hotel, However, I had not stayed at a Coast Hotel prior to Vancouver. I will stay at their Hotels in the future.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR93888536">I had little choice about where to stay - most hotels were fully booked. The Renaissance is on the edge of the downtown area - the uphill edge. While most things are within walking distance, the sharp uphill stretch on the return to the hotel is surprisingly unpleasant! The hotel itself is largely unremarkable. The public areas are clean but unmemorable; the staff are helpful but not particularly friendly; the rooms and bathrooms contain what you'd expect but nothing stands out as being of a high standard. The rooms were spacious. I had a room on a high floor and was hoping for good views; sadly they were marred by the very dirty windows, one of which was also suffering from condensation in the inner panes of the double-glazing where the seal had obviously failed. Breakfast wasn't bad, but I'd expected better. Overall, I'd be prepared to stay here again but I would explore alternatives first.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR93311116">My boyfriend and I have just got back from a wonderfully rainy weekend in Seattle. We were traveling from Victoria, BC, through the Amtrak train service so we were pretty tired by the time we got their. We booked a great deal with them through Hotwire,com earlier that day, and was hassle free at check in. They put us in a room facing the water with a very comfortable King size bed. The modernity of the hotel lobby continued throughout all the rooms and floors, especially the top floor with the "R-View" restaurant, fitness centre, and pool, the salt water touch was very nice as well. The location was exactly where we wanted to be..about a $5 cab ride to the nightlife, but out of the busy streets when going to sleep. The hotel also offered a refreshing &amp; inviting lobby where you wanted to sit, relax, and have a few drinks. Their was also a restaurant on the 2nd floor called Maxwell's that we discovered on the last morning of our stay where we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast for $16.75/each that included eggs,bacon,sausages,hashbrowns,fresh fruits,waffles, yogurt and all your morning beverages you could desire. We did however experience a slight downfall on the first night where a used bandaid was on the floor beside the bed, the chambermaids removed it immediately the next morning for us thankfully. Besides that we trusted the many other reviews that we read before we left and are very happy with the results! I highly recommend the Renaissance, the staff will go out of the way to help you with anything you need!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR93081995">We booked our one night stay on Priceline after winning a bid for $75.00 for the night. Priceline says this hotel is a 4 star property, but it is not in my opinion. I would put it at a 3 or possily 3.5 star. Here is why... The room furniture was scratched and had gouges in the surface. The tiles in the shower were cracked. There were scuff marks on painted surfaces. To me 4 star is attention to those details. So the room itself was more like a 3. The service was a little better. When we arrived I had mentioned we were there for my wife's birthday, and they asked me if we liked Wine or Beer. I said I liked Beer but my wife doesn't drink. When we returned from dinner they had placed two bottles of beer and a bottle of sparkling cider on ice in the room. Very cool. That service bumped me up to probably a 3.5 overall. The pool and hot tub were nice we spent a couple of hours there. Didn't try any of their lounges or restaurants. As far as noise goes, I do have to say you can hear things pretty easily. Heard a vaccum running in the morning, toilets flushing, heavy doors shutting, hotel itself creeking in the wind, and occasionally voices. Have to say the residants in the condos across the way are very entertaining and some even seem to enjoy putting on a show if you know what I mean. The parking underneath is tight. Hard to navigate and didn't appear to be enough. We came back around midnight or so and had to go all the way down. Overall, I can't complain for the price we paid. I'd stay again for that rate, but wouldn't pay full fare to stay here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR92691626">What a great trip, I am late writing this review. My wife and I stayed at the hotel on January 1&amp;2 checked out on the third. Hotel location was very good and afforded us the opportunity to walk around downtown Seattle without a care, thatâ€™s the nice thing about being on a mini vacation. We spent a bit of time in the Lounge on the top floor of the Hotel, what a view! Service was fine and the wine was nice. On Saturday night we made a reservation through the concierge with "Purple" what a great evening, I would recommend this restaurant and a flight of wine. Knowledgeable staff and great service. The concierge made several recommendations to us and each one was as good as the last, we were recognized when we needed to speak with him and we were treated royally, I will go back to this hotel if only for the Concierge.

Rooms were quite spacious and looked modernized. The washroom was really nice and really bright. The lights around the mirror were visually stunning. Just a tip... If you really want a quiet night, you may want to request for a room without an adjoining door to the next room. We were able to hear the next door neighbors even though they were speaking on a normal volume. Lucky for us it was people from our group. I will be coming back and will definitely recommend Renaissance Seattle Hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR91440261">Not really a four-star but better than a three star. Close to SAM, which was a main destination for us, a pretty good walk from Pike Market, and uphill but, hey, its good to get lots of exercise when on holidays. What we really enjoyed was being able to walk to two great restaurants: "Press" and "Anchovies and Olives" just off Madison east of the I5. Rooms were pleasant, gym was good, and we obtained a great deal on the price. Although I found the price of the parking high--$30/night--we were only charged for one night. I do hate being charged for in-room Wi-fi.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR91147243">June 2010. We had the opportunity to spend several nights at the Renassiance Madison hotel when business required us to be in the area. The hotel is on Madison on a hill. We took the Grayline Downtown Airporter bus into Seattle and this one of it's first stops. This was my first stay at this property. I have stayed three times at the Marriott Waterfront and one time at the Grand Hyatt on Pine within the past few years. Check-in was bit slow because the front desk staff was unsure I could use a coupon that Marriott at sent to me. It's a bit odd that Marriott Corp. and Individual Property Owners are not the same page with promotional discounts. After conferring with the GM, I was allowed to use the discount. Our room was facing Elliott Bay on a higher floor so there was not ground and/or freeway traffic to hear. The rate was reasonable for Seattle plus I used a Marriott promotional coupon. Our was very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed was ultra comfortable. Both feather and foam pillows were available. Lighting in the room was very good with lamps on both sides of the bed, on the desk, and a floor lamp. There are adjustable LED reading lamps on the bed which would be great if you were traveling with someone who wanted to sleep as you read. The work desk was large and the office-style chair functional and comfortable. My The room had a sofa and a comfortable arm chair. Since my last stay, new LCD flat screen TVâ€™s have been added. The TV was had a lot of cable channels as well as a wide selection of pay-per-view movies. I looked at some previews and costs per movie seemed to be between $12 and $15. The bathroom was also recently refurbished.. Lighting was good, the towels were plentiful, and the shower worked well â€“ immediate hot water with plenty of pressure. Bath amenities include shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash. The concierge lounge located on one of the top fllors Like guest rooms it has been recently refurbished. The hotel public areas were clean and well-kept, but could use an updating to the style of the rooms. The hotel has a large indoor swimming pool and hydrotherapy spa. Sliding doors open onto a patio with additional lounge chairs. Next to, and with windows looking onto the pool, is a very complete exercise room. All of the exercise equipment seemed nearly new. There is also a sauna and steam room accessible from the pool area. This property is located on a steep hill but the trick is to walk towards Pine street where the incline is gradual. If you take this route, then walking to the Waterfront and/or Pike's Public Market is not too bad. If you need to visit the local government offices and Federal courthouse, then this location is plus. It is also near the public library and is near the older Pioneer Square businesses and allows you visit another neighborhood of Seattle different from either the Public Market and/or Belltown. There is University of Washington store nearby too. Seattle is increasing becoming more visited due to all of Alaskan Cruise lines which prior to 9/11 disembarked from Vancouver, B.C. So sometimes property rates can be really high in this city. For a good rate, we will stay here again when visiting the Emerald City.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR90587610">Booked a single king room for a Saturday night via Priceline for $110. Would have prefered a location closer to the shopping district and Pike Place, but it was fine for us as we don't mind walking. Room was clean and modern with standard amenities including mini-fridge filled with 2 complimentary bottles of water. Free wireless in common areas but not in rooms. We requested a room on a higher floor away from the highway but was only able to secure a room on the 22nd floor on the highway side. Luckily, we didn't notice the highway traffic at all while sleeping. However, we did find the air conditioner/heater to be quite noisy as it would turn on and off periodically throughout the night. The $30 non valet parking does give you in and out privileges, but the parkade beneath the hotel is difficult to navigate. Upon returning to the hotel at 1030 or 11pm, we drove all the way to the bottom of the parkade but could not find an empty spot - even in the restricted area reserved for valet parking! Luckily, on our way out of the parkade, we found one empty stall at the parkade entrance that was previously filled. We weren't upset, but we did find it odd that such a huge hotel had such limited parking available for guests. When we mentioned our parking incident at check-out the next morning, the concierge explained that there had been a wedding at the hotel the previous night and that, had we not been able to find a parking spot, we could have driven the car back up to the hotel entrance and the valet could have secured a spot for us on the street. He also mentioned that parking is free in downtown Seattle on Saturdays after 6pm and all day Sunday, so we actually could have found street parking ourselves for our one night stay! We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but nothing in particular stood out to us as amazing. It's listed as a 4 star on many websites as it offers many amenities (none of which we utilized), but it feels more like a 3.5 star. I would stay here again but only at a discounted rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR90385826">We were lodged at the Renaissance through a bid on Priceline and reside locally in Seattle. We were assigned a room with an adjoining door to the next room--we assumed no one was in that room. Wrong! We could hear everything that was happening 'next' door--in this case there was a young excited child -- making sleep difficult (at best) and taking away any chance of a restful stay for us. The room needed a boost in temperature so we turned on the heater/AC system--we felt like we were on the runway of a major airport---extremely LOUD in room heater--not 4 star quality!!! The staff do as best they can, but one has to wonder what management is thinking when they cluster people in rooms that make sleeping impossible-in a hotel that was no where near capacity. The remodeling and updating appears to all be superficial, as the experience was less than satisfactory. I spoke to the front desk, and they felt that when the neighbor checked out--everything would be fine. True, except why were we assigned a room like this to begin with? This is the first time I've felt like a second class citizen at a hotel--and it happened in Seattle at the Renaissance.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR90346917">I would certainly go back to this hotel. All things considered, the hotel is adequate too nice. We only stayed one night, and spent most of our time out and about. We did not eat at the hotel at all. You have an entire city at your doorstep. Pros: - Downtown, walking distance from almost everything worth seeing downtown. - Affordable, I didn't think the price was unreasonable. - $140 for one night including parking for almost 2 days - Nice little bar on top floor for late night cocktails. - Staff are human, meaning honestly friendly without being fake. - Excellent king size bed. - Perfectly clean, everywhere. - Nice TV, with enough free channels to just chill out for a while. - We called for toothpaste, and they were there in less than a minute. - Check-in/out in less than 5 minutes, even with airline pilots arriving and going all the time. - Don't expect a new 5 star hotel. This is more like a slightly older, but very well decorated and managed 4 star. Cons: - The room air-con kept me awake until I finally decided to just turn it off. - Flushing next door can be heard clearly at night, since the walls are not concrete. - If you want to be fussy, you could complain about being close to the highway, with some rooms not having much of a view, and some noise. For us, it wasn't all that big of an issue. The air-con was noisier anyway.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR90305399">My wife and I took an overnight trip to Seattle to enjoy the holiday season and have a break from the kids while visiting grandma's house. The Renaissance Seattle Hotel made great trip, a outstanding trip! The room was 5-star quality; we slept on a comfy king size bed and woke up to a beautiful morning overlooking the city of Seattle from the 24th floor! The restuarant was a great choice for breakfast with a overly friendly staff and a great breakfast at very competitive prices! The whole hotel staff would go out of their way to serve us and ensure our stay was the best possible! I can't say enough good things about our stay and the great things about the hotel. We will definitely be back for a night's stay or even just to have a meal! Only negative comment: I-5 could cause a problems if you are a light sleeper... if so ask for the other side of the hotel. This didn't bother us, but we are heavy sleepers.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR90191252">My car was parked on the Renaissance hotel underground parking in Saturday, December 11th. It cost you $20 to park your car for more than 4 hours. When I return back from the event that was hold in this hotel, I found that somebody broke in to my car and all my electronincs (GPS, iPhod, Radar detector and my cell phone) were stolen. The hotel security was a zero help - they don't have cameras on the undeground parking. The $20 you pay for the parking doesn't give you any protection. The hotel management made it clear that they are not responsible for anything that would happen to your car. Basically you are on your own.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR88493816">Seattle Renaissance Hotel We booked this room via Travelocity for a great price, it included parking and a free upgrade to a Suite. Check-in...The staff member was nice and professional. We asked for a high floor on the cityside of the building and were given both request. Hotel Room...We were in a two room suite, small living room area and a small bedroom but perfect for what we wanted. The room have multiple views from the window and there was limited street noise in our room. The room was clean and stocked well with linens, towels and hotel information. There were two tvs, one in the living room, guessing about a 37 inch and one in the bedroom again guessing 32 inch. The tvs were LG brand and both were a little fuzzy. The bed was semi-comfortable and the sheets were a little rough as were the towels. The bedroom had a nice window seat. The bathroom was on the smaller side but worked well, the lighted mirror is a nice touch. The bathroom door is a joke, guessing that due to the small size of the bathroom having a door open into the bathroom wouldnâ€™t work well and having one open into the narrow hallway also wouldnâ€™t work well. The bathroom was also missing a proper towel rack. The closet space in the hallway was good and there was a safe in the closet. There was also a small fridge and shelf area next to the closet. Hotel...The hotel was nice, clean and the elevators were very fast. The bar and lobby area were nice. The gift shop was well stocked and had moderate prices. The parking garage under the hotel is a little tight and many of the parking spaces are also a bit tight. Hotel Staff...All staff members were great, we ordered delivery twice and asked the concierge for delivery advice and they were so helpful and even provided menus to different restaurants that deliver. The housekeeping staff were friendly and did a very good job cleaning the rooms, kudos to them. A coupleof issues...Two of the chanels on the TV were not working, we asked to be comped TV internet in return and the helpful employee did so, but the internet tv is not even worth the hassel when it is free. The bathroom door was off its track when we arrived at the hotel room. Maintenance was called and arrived quickly, but didnâ€™t properly fix the door. I ended up fixing the door after he left. We also decided the have the special Thanksgiving Buffet...to say the least it wasnâ€™t worth the price. The food was cold at times and they ran out of things like mashed potatoes quickly and you had to wait for them to refill the items. The selection was also not great. I also think having this buffet in the actual space of the R-view Restaurant on the 28th Floor would have been better instead of the 2nd Floor Maxwells location. The management should realize that Thanksgiving is special are for the price of the meal having a nice view would be a nice touch. Overall we would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR87713135">I recently stayed at this hotel as part of a conference with multiple non-profit organizations. The location of the hotel is ok, but do be aware that you will need to do a little walking to get to a plethora of restaurants. Within 6 blocks or so, one can be in the midst of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel itself is ok but I'm not sure I would call it a 4 star hotel but perhaps more of a 3.5 star. As a meeting planner, my reviews are based on more than the hotel room itself and take the meeting space and hotel amenities into consideration. At check-in, I was placed on the Club Level - 26th floor. My room was spacious with a king bed and two chairs. The view from my room included city sights as well as the freeway and in the distance on a clear day, one can see the snow capped mountains. Amenities: The hotel offers a decent sized fitness center on the 28th floor along with an indoor pool and hot tub. The hotel also offers a Business Center on the lower level of the hotel, however, it is costly to use ($1.20 per page printed black ink only) and while I was there, the equipment consistently was out of order. Meeting Space: I was not impressed by the meeting space. I felt it was older and needed renovations and is far too spread out over 5 floors. The first three levels on which the meeting space is located are connected by escalators but the additional 2 floors require use of the stairs or elevator. The rooms themselves are standard rooms though some have windows with a view. Food: The hotel offers one restaurant, one restaurant/bar, one coffee shop/bar and in-room dining. Food prices are consistent with most other hotels. Catering for events was perfectly fine and I was happy the hotel was willing to meet the diverse dietary needs of my group (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-intolerant, etc.). Room service was prompt and hot (unlike many hotels I have visited). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others though I am not sure I would host an event here again due to the layout of the meeting space. My main complaint about the hotel is the elevators. While I understand that my meeting included over 600 attendees, I was on the 26th floor and consistently had to wait for quite a while for an elevator to get to various floors. Though this hotel has 5 elevators, an addition of two more elevators would be ideal as they move fairly slowly and seem to not respond as quickly as in other properties in which I have stayed.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR87178962">Overall, this hotel was pretty good. We stayed here for 4 nights and had very little interaction with the staff. Our room was small but nicely decorated. On our first night, we went to the bar on the 28th floor, where they had a great happy hour special and nice views of downtown Seattle. The location is okay. We walked to Pike Market every day, and were able to walk to other downtown areas (Captiol Hill, Pioneer Square, the ferry terminal) as well. It is up a hill but it's an invigorating walk. If you don't feel up to it, it's easy to hail a cab around the city. The walls were kind of thin. There was a really loud woman in the room next to ours. I had to knock on her door and ask her to quiet down b/c her loud talking was waking me up at 6 am every day. I could also hear our neighbors' alarm clocks. In this day and age, I find it offensive that any hotel would still charge for WiFi. With this hotel, it was worse because they also charge for use of their computers.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86915594">THE GREATS ABOUT THIS HOTEL: This hotel was amazingly up to date and modern, and so clean I could eat off the floors The staff was impeccable. We were actually SHOWN around the lobby/elevators by the front desk staff. The valet got a cab for us with a huge smile. Our servers both for dinner and in the morning couldn't do enough for us. We were stunned. The bed had a goose down comforter that I seriously wanted to steal. I've NEVER taken a thing from a hotel, but if I could have taken that bed and those pillows in my suitcase , I would have. Water pressure was fantastic-the shower was terrific Lots of elevators and escalators. We never had to wait. THE NOT SO GREATS Be to be sure and get a higher floor--we were on the 12th floor, and could still hear traffic noise from the nearby freeway. There isn't much within walking distance as far as food, but the restaurant is pretty good. Have the Prix Fix menu of the salad and the salmon for $28. Best salmon I've had in years. Taxis are sitting in front of the hotel, there isn't a shuttle. Has teeny water pot and enough coffee for 2 cups or enough tea for 2 cups. That was a cheap little surprise in the coffee center of the universe-Seattle. NO microwave AMENITIES Room service was available Aveno complimentary products Ironing Board/Iron in room Blow Dryer in Room Extra blanket available in the closet Fridge in the room Small store on lower level-open until 10pm Pool and Spa Nicely equipped work out room, although busy I priceline'd this hotel for $73, if that helps. I would have easily paid double...and not been upset about it at all. We will return.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86689722">I purchased this hotel on priceline and was discouraged when I looked at website, did not seem appealing. I couldn't have been more wrong....the hotel is beautiful and the staff is awesome, very polite and helpful in every way. It is definitely on a hill but only a few blocks from Pikes Market and I guess there is a free bus that you can catch for a return trip. The only drawback is if you don't bring your computer, they have a business room but you pay for computer use by the minute..... We would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR84808490">Before I made a reservation I read all the reviews and I was a little skeptical. However, we were staying with Marriott Rewards points and the Marriott downtown didn't have any rooms. We decided to bite the bullet and stay at the Renaissance. As rewards members we were upgraded to a room in the 23rd floor with marvelous water and mountains views. The room itself was very nice and clean with lots of space. The fitness room was a little crowded but not bad for a hotel. We didn't use the pool because we forgot our bathing suits but it looks like a very nice pool to relax at the end of the day. Every one was very nice and polite during our stay. When we asked, the valet parking attendant suggested that we park our car on the street to avoid the hotel parking fee since parking on the street is free on the weekends. There was never an issue with extra towels and toiletries. Some people have complained about the location. We didn't experience any noise and the walk was a pleasant walk. The walk is uphill but we found it invigorating, great way to exercise. For those that have problems walking, there is taxi service outside the hotel. The concierge service is excellent with great knowledge of the city. While we were able to catch a signal from another building, one thing they should change is the access to high speed internet; $12.95 per day is a lot of money for a service that should be free. The hotel room rates are a little high but I would stay here again even if we don't have enough points for a free night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR83767323">landed this hotel on Priceline for $125.00 for the night. My gal pal and I flew over from Victoria on a floatplane.(Kenmore Air) what a blast! we had a smooth ride and then we were less than 10 min to our hotel. We were warmly received- clean and nicely appointed room. We were a quick walk down hill to Pikes Market and great shopping(Nordstroms!) Breakfast in the cafe on the second level was excellent, no problem sharing(who needs a 3 egg omelette) overall a terrific experience. There are hotels that are closer to the center and market, but we were so impressed with the service of this hotel- we would return!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR83217494">The Renaissance Hotel is situated very centrally right off the I-5. Shopping can be walking distance at the Westlake Centre downtown. Great free parking on the weekends on the street. The hotel itself is quite old, but the lobby has been redone and looking modern and nice. The room is clean and the washroom has been redone and very clean. Our room faced the I-5 and was very noisy. We just turned the fan on to act as white noise so we can get some sleep, otherwise the highway noise can be quite disruptive. The exercise room and pool are on the top floor, with a nice view. The pool water was rather cool.<topic>none</topic>

The rooms are very clean (albeit somewhat small), but the updated furnishings and warm, inviting undertone of the decor made for a very pleasant stay. The hotel staff was very courteous in accommodating all of my requests. We had dinner at sunset at the hotel restaurant on the top floor.. it was gorgeous and I highly recommend it if you stay there. The rooms are very well insulated, so I slept like a baby.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR80343350">We booked one night at this hotel prior to leaving Seattle for San Francisco. We just needed a place to crash for our last evening and opted for this one since it looked pretty reasonable at 50 euros each. I wasn't expecting anything particularly exciting due to all the lukewarm reviews I had previously read, but I must admit I was quite pleasantly surprised with this one. We got a room on the 12th floor with gorgeous views of downtown Seattle, including Rem Koolhass' public library, and the room was neat, tidy, spacious and welcoming, with probably the best shower of my trip. Given my low expectations, I should say this came out as a very positive surprise.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR79288594">This Renaissance has an outstanding staff in all departments: Front Desk, Concierge, Waiters, Housekeeping, Doorman, everywhere. If there are any problems, then you are probably the problem because the staff is extremely cheerful and go out of their way helpful. The breakfast is worth getting up early for. The location is about 6 steep blocks up from the waterfront, but right off of Rt 5. The rooms vary (we stayed twice in August). This used to be the Madison Hotel before Marriott acquired it, so the rooms are not as big as most Renaissance. But the corner rooms are good size and very nice. The beds are good but not as great as some Renaissance. The exercise room and pool are adequate. The lobby is new and the bar area is nice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR79079310">Went with my wife and 3 month old. Got a smokin deal and was takin back by how nice it was inside. Didn't pay $40 for the parking and parked on the street, beacause it was a long weekend we didn't have to plug parking meters. It was fairly close to all amenities of down town. Some crazy hills outside. I would recomend zig zagging up streets to avoid one constant hill climb. Would stay there again if was to get the same good deal. They had a beautiful fireplace down stairs where you could kick back and sip some cocktails. Food was a little over priced in the Hotel and would strongly recommend taking a two minute stroll around the block for restaurants.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR77170162">The first room I got from the front desk was one facing the highway and close to the elevator but on a high floor. I requested another room and then got a very nice city view facing the downtown area within minutes. At night, I could see the city light up and, during the day, I could see as far as Safeco Field and Qwest Field. During my stay, I had a small problem with not having cold water but it was promptly fixed. I also had the chance to go for a short swim on the pool on the top floor (28) of the hotel in the morning and I was offered beautiful views of the city. If I had more time, I would go back at night too. Overall, the hotel staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms were modern and newly renovated (halls were kinda a weird pink though, but I appreciate the bold color choice); housekeeping was very attentive. She brought me bottled water every day for tea and coffee and made sure I had enough toiletries and towels every day (yay Aveda!). I think I became spoiled...:) The location was in the middle of downtown Seattle, overlooking an interstate highway. However, one can walk over the highway via an overpass and it is not loud at all. I enjoyed this hotel's location very much; it was just a few blocks from Frye Art Museum, the Underground Tour, Smith Tower, and the Columbia Tower SkyView. The concierge directed me to these attractions and they did not disappoint. Just beware that the hotel is located on a hill. It may be challenging at the end of a long sightseeing day to climb back up. Seattle is very walkable. I took the downtown free ride zone buses (Bus 12); one of their last stops is at front of the hotel. After walking to Pine St. and 5 or 6 Ave., it is possible to take a monorail at Westlake Center to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project). I also recommend the SkyView Observatory at Columbia Tower instead of the Space Needle. It is only $5 ($3 for students with ID) as compared to like $18 at the Needle. The view there is far more stunning and expansive, without the wires that cover the Space Needle's viewing deck. I've been to both and I can honestly say that the Space Needle is really all hype.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR76874307">Be sure to ask for a room on the West side of the hotel. The East side faces the highway and can be pretty noisy. The room was nice, clean and spacious enough. All dining and attractions were located at least several blocks away if not more, all downhill. That sounds great until you have to hike back up. The $30/night parking was steep, but this is a city. Next time I will stay closer in town to, believe it or not, avoid noise and be closer to the attractions.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR75183781">Lobby, staff, concierge, mattress are all great. Rooms need some updating (needs more lighting and the light peach paint felt very 80s).

<comment category="positive" id="UR74844796">The Renaissance is a nice, modern hotel. We paid $175 on priceline.com for a double room - same room goes for $240 on the hotel's website. We wouldn't have booked without getting a discounted rate. Biggest disappointment with this hotel was that they didn't offer a breakfast nor do they offer free internet/wi-fi access. Overnight parking costs $30, but you can go in and out with room key. The hotel was located at the North end of Downtown Seattle and not really in walking distance to main sites (unless you want to walk back up steep hills). We took cabs to the market and baseball game, but didn't pay over $10 on a cab ride and the trips didn't take more than 10 minutes. Hotel is right on I-5, but we didn't notice the traffic with the window closed and a/c on at night.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR72651928">This hotel is on a hill so if you plan to walk from the hotel to the many nearby attractions, be ready to work your quad muscles, because walking up the hill can be literally breathtaking:) I am exaggerating a bit, but it is a leg workout nonetheless. The lobby areas are nicely decorated in a modern design, there is a nice bar and lounge area with a big flat screen TV where I watched people eating dinner in front of. The 28th floor has a restaurant with beautiful city views and it also has a small fitness facility and salt water or saline pool (I can't remember which). It is a 15 min walk to the monorail which takes you to the Space Needle and lots of shopping and restaurants along the way. Also the hotel is just a hop, skip and jump to the modern public library. One drawback it that it is located next to a freeway, so if you're smog sensitive perhaps this is not the place for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR72088960">We spent a few days touring Seattle before we boarded a ship for our Alaskan cruise. It was our first time in Seattle and we were very glad that we booked this particular hotel. We had a room on the 26th floor which was the concierge level. The room had been updated with lots of nice amenities and a great view of the city. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean (I'm a stickler for cleanliness!). The food in the Concierge Club was so-so, but the friendliness of the staff made up for what the food lacked. I had spoken with the hotel prior to our visit and asked them to book a Town Car to pick us up at the airport. The car arrived right on time, with a very pleasant driver, who handled our bags and delivered us to the front door of the hotel. Before we left for the cruise we wanted to ship home some items we had bought in the city. The front desk staff went out of their way to find us packaging supplies for our gifts and get them picked up by FedEx. Next time we go to Seattle we will be staying at this hotel for sure!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR71775056">I loved my stay at the Renaissance Hotel! From reading the reviews, it sounds like a renovation took place recently. The gym is awesome- 5 or 6 treadmills overlooking the city, ellipticals, weights, and other machines made it really nice!! The saltwater pool and hot tub also looked over the city. These were spectacular views from the 28th floor! The hotel staff was very friendly. We asked for a room with two beds, but they didn't have one, so they gave us a suite! They brought up a rollaway bed. Great view.. I recommend getting a room on a high floor. I had no noise issues! The bathroom was nice- they even have Aveda shampoo and conditioner. The location is great for shopping (about 5 blocks away) and going to Pike's Market (down some steep hills you'll have to eventually come up again, but closeby). The food is expensive if you get ro service, but everything was pretty good! The water pressure is low, but I figure that's because they are trying to conserve water.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR70494174">The corner suite on the 16th floor was beautiful. The problem was freeway noise that went on all night long. Even on the 16th floor with the air conditioner running, it could not be drowned out. I asked to be moved to the west side of the hotel which faces Puget Sound, but those rooms are saved for Marriott Gold and Platinum elite Rewards members. Unless, you are elite, stay elsewhere. If you are elite, then stay here. Fitness room is very nice and corner lounge on the top floor (28th) is beautiful. As a business traveler, I do not like having to pay for basic business services such as internet to check email and print jobs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR69081444">I scored a great rate, with breakfast for two, and parking included (through travelocity) for this hotel during a short (2 night) stay in Seattle. The hotel location is perfect. It is within walking distance to just about everything we wanted to see/do while in Seattle. It does sit on the top of a very steep hill, so walking back up after a long day of sight-seeing is a bit of a trek. I would recommend grabbing a cab for the return trip (less than $5 from most places). The room was nice. Two comfortable double beds with multiple pillows, a desk, chair, refridgerator, and decent sized closet. The bathroom is niclely updated with pleanty of counter space and nice toiletries. We had a room with access to the concierge lounge, which provided free snacks, drinks, and continental breakfast items each day. Our room faced the highway, but I did not hear any noise (on the 27th floor). The parking was convienient. The garage is very small, with tight access around corners and into spots. I can't complain since the price was included in the room rate. We ate a full breakfast twice at Maxwells. The buffet was very good, with a selection of hot and cold items. On Sunday morning there was even someone doing made-to-order omlets. There is paid internet access in the rooms, but all common areas have free wi-fi. The first floor lounge has comfortable chairs and a fireplace and was a great place to do some quick internet surfing without paying.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68784809">My husband and I took a quick trip to Seattle and stayed at this hotel for one night. We flew in and took the lite rail downtown from the airport. We got off at University Street and it was about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. When people write about a hill to get to this hotel they are right! It is a huge hill to walk up! Luckily we just had backpacks so it wasn't a problem with luggage but if you have luggage I would not recommend taking this route. There is a bus that will drop you off at the door but by the time our plane landed that bus had stopped running. The room was a nice size with a King size bed, chair, desk and desk chair and a nice flat screen TV. Everything was extremely clean! The bathroom was a nice size and towels were so plush and soft and thick. The toiletries were Aveda shampoo, conditioner and lotion. The hair dryer was a nice high powered one, not a typical sunbeam wall mounted dryer. We were on the side of the hotel with the highway but neither one of us felt that it was too noisy. Our first night we took a cab to the Space Needle. The front desk told us it was a 20 minute walk but I would definitely not want to do that walk at night and even during the day it would be pretty long...seemed like more than 20 minutes to me. The hotel staff hailed a cab for us very quickly. The next morning we walked to Pike Place Market. It was about a 10-15 minute walk. From there we did walk to the Space Needle and then took a cab to the Underground walking tour. We only stayed at this hotel for one night, but it was a very nice stay and I would definitely return to this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR68240819">The Renaissance Seattle Hotel is rated as a four star hotel on many websites. While it is very nice, I don't believe it's a 4-star property. The service is very good and the staff is friendly and ready to help with any request. The hotel is showing wear and tear in spots. My room on the 21st floor faced I-5 and I could hear a bit of traffic noise. If you are staying here, plan on more road noise the lower you are â€“ if you are staying on the east side of the hotel. One of the sound proof window panes in my room had failed and was cloudy. My room was nicely appointed; the refrigerator in the room is a nice convenience. The bathroom, while nice was very small. I visited the top floor lounge and the views are impressive. But, the place looks like it was last renovated in the mid 90s. I think the hotel is missing an opportunity here to turn this space in to something nicer. Much has been made about the parking situation at the hotel. If you don't have to drive to the hotel, don't. You don't need a vehicle to get around Seattle from the hotel (yes there are hills, so if you're out of shape, you might disagree with this statement). The $30 non valet parking does give you in and out privileges with your room card key, but the garage beneath the hotel is hard to navigate and has a 6' 2" height restriction. I received a nice deal from Priceline on this hotel. If I would've paid something closer to rack rates, I donâ€™t think I would have been as happy.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66783533">We had a great stay. Went with a group of 11 year old boys to go to a Sounders game. Everything was excellent. The rooms were fine. Recently done over. Very clean. Excellent housekeeping during our stay. The beds were comfortable and we all commented on how well we slept, save for one of our party due to a bit of noise through the adjoining doors of the neighbouring room. The swimming pool on the 28th floor was a hit; great view! We ate in the Lobby Lounge and in Maxwells. Both times the food was good, tasty, served quickly and the service was great. There are some disadvantages to this property, like there are at most hotels throughout the world. A little bit of research will help you in the long run. The underground parking lot is not great. It's low. It's expensive (but all parking in Seattle is IMHO) and yes there is a lack of space to pull in to drop your bags. But it is all doable. We did it, everyone else in our group did it but you just need to be a bit flexible. The I-5 side is noisier. Request a room on the other side facing the water. Get a room without an adjoining door. I couldn't disagree more with breakerm's review in regards to location though. We were very impressed with how close it was to everything. Fair enough you need to be reasonably mobile but we walked from the hotel to Pike Place Market to REI to Space Needle and back then went to the Sounder's soccer game. All this with kids. We all commented on how convenient the location was. Qwest and Safeco Fields are a reasonably close walk away. If you want free WIFI, go across the street to the Public Library and they have wireless in the building. So all in all we all enjoyed staying here. The parking is not brilliant but the beds, housekeeping, food, service and location are great. Know a bit about the hotel beforehand and you'll end up having a great experience there like we did!<topic>none</topic>

The rooms look like they were update recently and the common areas are very nice. We help several meetings in the hotel and the staff were very helpful. The food was excellent. Ask for a room away from the highway. Mine was facing in the direction of the highway and you do get road noise. One thing that annoyed me - the charge for internet usage. Why do i still need to pay for this when budget hotels give it away? Outrageous to charge what they do.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR65400571">One of the first things that strikes you about this hotel is that there is no portico, or drive/drop area. Yeah, around the side there are two "3 minute drop" spots...but, realistically your chances of snagging one of these is limited, so you're pretty well forced to pull into the underground parking structure. The parking garage is "unique" in its layout and not user friendly. Getting your luggage/gear into the hotel involves going up several floors to the lobby, to register...then getting one of the bell staff to follow you back down to the vehicle with a cart. It works...and the staff are very eager to assist. Just a tad inconvenient for someone arriving with a vehicle. The location of this hotel is NOT very convenient for a tourist wanting to walk around the various downtown core areas...it's way too far away...Pikes Market is a long shlep...and almost entirely UPHILL on the return...my advice: walk down, taxi back...don't even think of driving into this area...parking is a nightmare. The rooms are clean, but of average quality...probably not really a four-star. The I-5 side of the hotel is REALLY noisy...so, insist on a room on the opposite side...and one that is at least above the 15th floor. Quite a few comments have been made about the bathroom door setup...the etched-glass sliding door is not the best solution...any thought of leaving the light on during the night (as a night light for those late-night visits) will provide way too much light for sleeping. Two interesting things: the toilet is a very, VERY low affair...almost like a squat-hole one would find in a third-world country...and the sink drain, although part of a very attractive facet is really well hidden for the technically challenged! A few blocks from the hotel are some good food choices: Brooklyn Seafood (ultra fresh, but a little steep on the pricing), a GREAT happy hour can be found a few blocks further at the Metropolitan Grill...probably the best in Seattle. If you want the real-deal Chinese experience try Sichaun Cuisine in the International area...the best double-baked almond croisant in Seattle: Bakery Nouveau...just yelp for details.<topic>none</topic>

Remained at a cool 68 for my entire week's stay. Attended a training class the entire week held at the hotel. Loved that it was kiddie corner to the public library. The only dislike was the steep hill--but that was nothing in comparison to staying at the hotel. Staff was friendly. Dining in room service -- 15 minutes flat! I'd stay here again!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR63747299">My spouse had a conference in the ballroom of this hotel and I tagged along to go shopping. Nebiat at the front desk was super helpful on check-in, very friendly. With elite status we had the option of free parking or breakfast vouchers. Parking is steep at $30/night so we chose that. Pets have a $100 cleaning fee so unfortunately we had to leave our pup with a friend. Our room was super clean and the view of the water was amazing! I always look forward to 'hotel pillows' but these ones were not comfy at all. One day I went shopping for over 6 hours, housekeeping didnt come while I was gone, not a big deal. I came back to have a nap and she walked in even though I had the 'do not disturb' sign up. I wasnt impressed. We were on the 23rd floor and could hear the highway traffic and ambulance sirens. We live in downtown Vancouver so it was very quiet in comparison to home. If you arent in shape I'd recommend taking a $5-$10 cab to the shopping/restaurants around. You dont realize how steep it is until you have to walk back up to the hotel. Approx 10-15 min walk to Nordstrom/Macy's/Pike Place etc.. lots to do and see. The restaurant on the top floor had a spectacular view of Puget Sound. Highly recommend it for a glass of wine, but the service was extremely slow when we went for dinner at 8pm. Food was nothing to write home about. The day we left we ate at the cafe on the 2nd floor for a buffet breakfast. Mark our server was on top of things and we could tell he enjoys his job and wants to provide top notch service. We had access to the club lounge on the 26th floor which had breakfast, coffee/tea, etc and appetizers at dinner time. The hotel employee monitoring the room was helpful with restaurant recommendations and even made a reservation for us at the Daily Grill. The server there told us the hotel had ordered us an appetizer on them. Nice touch. Upon checkout we noticed we were billed for parking. I also made 2 phone calls under 1 minute each to my spouse who was downstairs. $11 EACH! Do not use their phones under any circumstances. The clerk at the front desk removed the parking charges but he couldnt explain why the call charges were so steep. I loved this hotel but would only stay there again if I wasnt planning on doing any sight-seeing. There are other hotels closer to the downtown core with the same room rates. Its too much of a hike to go out for meals/shopping a few times per day. Maybe Im just lazy ;)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR62816768">The Good - Availability of good rates. But guess why the rates are so good...read on... The Bad - HIGHWAY NOISE. I stayed on the 10th floor of the hotel - room 1013, which unfortunately faced the highway. Wow, the highway noise was breathtakingly loud. With the constant roar of traffic and the grinding gears of semi trucks, I convinced myself several times over that a window was ajar, but nope, the closed windows simply had little to no noise insulation. This was true also of the walls between rooms; conversations from the next room over were clearly audible in our room. Earplugs are an absolute must. - Location. Right in the heart of Seattle's highway on-ramp district, this hotel was a significant hike from the attractions and neighborhoods that a tourist would be interested in visiting. This might not be true for business travelers. - Internet price. Ugh, $12.95 for wired internet every day? Please hotels, just build that cost into the hotel rate. - Sliding bathroom door. Probably not a problem for a solo traveler, but when sharing a room with someone else, it's annoying how the bathroom door is on a sliding rail rather than a traditional door hinge. It means the bathroom door doesn't close entirely. Instead, the door squeaks on its railing and doesn't provide the same privacy as a door in terms of sight or, sorry, smell. The bottom line - Even at such an inexpensive rate, the negatives associated with staying here clearly outweighed the positives. I'll definitely choose another hotel in Seattle next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR62327291">A good location for anyone who is trying to get a neutral walking friendly location. With the exception of the Space Needle you can walk to most attractions including Pike Place Market and the stadiums. We were treated exceptionally by the staff, which really made this property shine. We felt like it was five-star white-glove treatment, the rooms were more on par with the 4* rating and the room could have been cleaner (windows/bathroom were a bit dirty upon check-in) but we did get a corner king upgrade with a fantastic bedroom panoramic view of the city. Be careful of the â€œOn Demandâ€� Network TV Shows â€“ you will be charged without even seeing the price or a confirmation screen. Also, you can park on the street from 6pm to 8am for free and there is plenty of spots. If you go for a weekend, Sunday parking is also free.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR61191866">I loved my recent stay at the Renaissance. It seemed like the majority of the guests were there for conferences (many held at the hotel), but I really enjoyed it for my vacation base. The location is great with easy walking distance to the waterfront, Pike Place, great shopping and restaurants. The rooms were a little small but very nice, with large flat screen tvs, extremely comfortable beds, and furnishings that seemed new. Service at the hotel was outstanding and is what I think really sets this hotel at a higher level than some of the other chains at similar to slightly lower prices. The breakfast buffet was really good, and we enjoyed both hotel bars (one on the first floor and one on the top floor). Drinks were a bit expensive but tasty, and the views from the top floor were nice. My room was on the freeway side but the noise didn't bother me at all. It was just like a steady buzz. I booked this with a good deal that included free breakfast for two (buffet) each day plus a 25$ Visa gift card for each night I stayed. I think that with these perks the value was excellent.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR57384374">I didn't want to stay at the Renaissance due to it's distance from the Convention Center, but I'm glad I did. The six block walk to the convention center is all downhill and gives one the opportunity to check out the shopping and fine dining along the way. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by the friendly and courteous staff. And I must say the staff was excellent during my entire stay. The door men, concierge, even the bartenders were knowledgeable and helpful with any and every question I had regarding Seattle. In particular, the concierge, Jean-Paul, provided excellent advice regarding fine dining. I needed to entertain several business associates, and Jean-Paul directed me to an excellent restaurant and secured a table for us without a reservation. Fantastic service. My business associates were very pleased. I can't recall a single instance in which a staff member was not eager and ready to assist me. A job well done to the Renaissance Seattle. Also, the food was excellent. I did not dine at the Visions lounge which is the restaurant/bar on the top floor, but I spent quite a bit of time at the lobby bar. Lunch starts at noon, and it's fantastic. The quality of the food is excellent and worth the premium one usually pays for dining at the hotel. After a disappointing lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, I had a splendid meal at the lobby bar. My compliments to the chef. I stayed in a standard room without any complaint. The accommodation was roomy with a soft bed and an ample selection of pillows to choose from (soft to extra firm). Unlike other premium hotels I have stayed at, the "Do Not Disturb" sign actually worked. On the days I decided to sleep in, I did not receive any hostile calls from housekeeping asking me if I wanted my room cleaned. If I slept in, I wasn't disturbed. And when I returned in the evening, I came back to clean towels and a freshly made bed. Fantastic! The service and quality was excellent and well worth the daily room rate. Though they don't tell you up front, there is free internet access in the lobby (including bar and lounge area). If you are staying in downtown Seattle, this is a wonderful hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR57380323">We love staying at Marriott's, but this was our first time at The Renaissance. What a great hotel! We stayed in one of the Executive Suites on the 23rd floor in the SW corner. We had great views and weren't bothered by the I-5 traffic. Room service was fantastic...the food and the service. We had breakfast delivered every morning (we purchased the Valentine's special so breakfast was included). The pancakes were fluffy. The oatmeal was hot and served with raisins and brown sugar. The bacon and sausage were cooked to order. Needless to say, we were well equipped with energy to have a great morning walking around town. Dinner through room service was good, too. However, I think the nearby by restaurants probably are a bit better. We received free parking, free wireless internet, and free breakfasts along with two $100 reward certificates to be used during a future stay at any Renaissance Hotel. We'll be back to visit this hotel soon!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR57079479">We had a great rate to stay here and knew Renaissance is Marriott's luxury hotel brand. The hotel turned out to exceed our needs. We were staying for just a nice before driving to Canada. The hotel shows that it's recently been renovated with great furniture throughout the lobby and guest room. The staff is really friendly even though we felt they were understaffed when we arrived and had to wait in line while the desk attendants were helping others with directions. Hotel parking was convenient underground. Based on Tripadvisor reviews, we asked for a room away from the 5 Freeway which meant it was quiet -- we were across from the city courthouse. We also had drinks in the bar at night and thought it was a nice lounge, quiet on a weekend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53774271">I stayed here in the Fall for a conference. The hotel was chosen for its "green" practices, which are commendable and worth a mention. Like most places, they still have a ways to go in that direction, but they have many practices that go beyond just low flow toilets and not changing the sheets and towells every day unless asked. Aside from that, they were one of the nicer hotels I've stayed at in Seattle. I'm a government employee, and when we travel we almost always get the least desirable rooms as we pay the gov't rate. Mine was in the back of the building, close to both the elevator and the ice machine, overlooking the freeway and the city street, yet it was very quiet and very comfortable. The rooms are all set up suite style, and I must say the bed was as comfy as any I've slept in. Could I have found a way to get it in my suitcase, I might have been guilty of hotel theft. In addition, the hotel has a nice restaurant with a great view, and the food was very good and reasonably priced, with very nice wait staff. Staff at this hotel were outstanding, too, from the wait staff at the restaurant to the check-in staff to the doormen. Helpful, friendly, considerate, efficient, responsive. You can always tell a hotel that is good to work for; people seemed happy to be at their jobs and to really make an effort. Our conference facilities, too, were excellent. Even the food served at the conference was a cut above. I wasn't involved in setting it up, so I can't speak to how easy they were to work with, but if the flawless service and really delicious food (and I know we got the least expensive options, because that's a requirement) were any indications, if ever I need to set one of these things up in Seattle, they will be my first choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR50535305">We were excited about getting a room for less than $100 in downtown Seattle...but.... As the other reviews state, you do hear a lot of traffic noise, even on the west side. Barely a view of the water, since there are so many other tall buildings blocking the view. Very good appetizers for the $2 happy hour price. Room very clean, roomy. No bargains for us, since we reserved on hotwire... Others have mentioned free parking, free desserts, free breakfast, etc., but not with our budget reservations... I guess you pay one way or the other - parking was too expensive and we didn't get a break... We enjoyed it, anyway. Would choose a different hotel next time, though. No microwave, small shelves in small refrigerator - couldn't put our leftovers in it... Loved the pillows &amp; feather comforter...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR50289205">My boyfriend and I stayed here for the Thanksgiving weekend and we were happy with our room. It was spacious and clean, with great views. The hotel has a great 28th floor restaurant/bar called the Visions Lounge which has a good happy hour and great views of the city. Another great thing about the hotel was the free gym and pool access. My biggest gripes with the Renaissance was it's expensive parking ($38/day), location, and expensive internet services ($12.95/day). It is adjacent to the I-5 and it can get a little loud. Also, it's a bit of a walk to downtown attractions like Pioneer Square, Pikes Place, and the mall. Coming back after a long day downtown can be difficult as the Renaissance is located atop a San Francisco-esque hill. Still, with all that, I think it was a good value. Large, clean, comfortable rooms with a nice lounge, and good concierge service. I think it was worth the extra walking.<topic>none</topic>

The rooms are large and comfortable and the hotel is equipped with all of the usual amenitites--fitness center, restaurant, lounge, etc. What makes this hotel particularly outstanding, however, is the concierge.

I only had two complaints: (1) This hotel is noisy. It is adjacent to Interstate 5 and I had a hard time sleeping at night. For this reason alone, I would probably not stay there unless I could get a room on the western side of the hotel. I heard traffic at all hours of the night. (2) The concierge lounge is way too small for the number of business guests they have. We had very little space to sit down and eat. The concierge staff was very attentive. This is a nice hotel...but I need peace and quiet when I sleep.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR48723475">I got a deal of $70 per night through Priceline for this hotel. At that price it was a good deal. If I was paying the $170-200 I saw on their web site I would have been disappointed. The room is clean and had sitting chairs. Almost everything in the hotel only comes with extra $$. I big pet peeve for me is that they charge for internet access. In this day and age, wireless should be free at every hotel. The location is poor as it is right next to the freeway. Also, that area of DT Seattle on a weekend is pretty dead.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR48591942">I stay in Marriott properties (including Renaissance) on a regular basis and have tried them around the globe. This is one of the most disappointing properties I've stayed in. First off, the hotel is located over a highway which is somewhat of a convenience as the hotel is located very centrally within Seattle. My initial room, however, was over the highway and had surprisingly little sound insulation. I literally could not sleep due to the traffic noise - and I was on the 17th floor. When I requested a room change, they initially told me there were no available rooms. When I told them of my Marriott status - which they did not request when I checked in - a room suddenly materialized. Although this is a non-smoking property, I was overwhelmed with smoke from one of my neighbors on several occasions - bad luck on my part. The concierge lounge is the smallest I've seen and extremely crowded. I personally will try one of the other Marriott properties the next time I'm in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR47835097">Our trip to Seattle in late July/early August started with a 2 night stay at the Seattle Renaissance. The best part of this hotel was the location. It is such easy access to all the main sites of Seattle. We were able to easily walk to downtown, the piers, Pike's Place Market, and to the Monorail that took us to Seattle Center/Space Needle/Duck Tours. A rental car wouldn't have been necessary for the activities we did. The pool on the (?28th floor) was small, but offers a great view of the city. You can find an even better view of the city from the lounge/bar area. They offered a great happy hour with great tasting appetizers.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR45130930">We stayed at the Renaissance while in Seattle to move our son into the dorms at Seattle Pacific University. We booked the rooms on Priceline and were very happy with the rate for a hotel chain that has a reputation of quality rooms and great service. We were please with the service that we received from the staff, although i am annoyed when guests are not allowed to use a luggage cart (a number of carts were parked near the front door) and must use the services of a bell hop. We have two strong sons that are more than capable of managing our luggage, but instead we are required to tip a bell hop. I also found the parking prices to be ridiculous, even for Seattle...$28 per day. We have never paid even close to this amount for parking at a hotel, even in San Francisco and New York City. Charging $13 per day for internet access was the last straw. Our room was very nice, with comfortable bedding and a convenient charging station for electronics. One small room complaint...the bathroom doors are sliders that have no latch or lock.<topic>none</topic>

This was our first time in that far west, much less Seattle, so we didn't know what to expect. We arrived and the hotel was nice!!! Check-in is was pleasant and smooth...and we even received wine and fruit in our room. (had the family/friends starwood elite treatment) Our room was on the 15th floor or something, it was for the preferred guests. And they know how to treat preferred guests!!! The preferred guest lounge was top shelf with free food and a free happy hour on certain days. I even met the manager of guest services at the happy hour reception who was very nice and hospitable. (forgot her name, but she was Black) My wife and I were so impressed with the preferred guest treatment, we felt like a king and queen. It was unfortunate though, that EVERY customer doesn't that same type of treatment. (people on the first 8 floors---the non-preferred "regular" guests) The stratification made us kinda sad, to see that certain guests were treated better than others. It was nice, but we wished everyone could have experienced what we did. We also ate in the restaurant lounge at the top of the hotel. (can't remember the name) But it was super top shelf with an AMAZING VIEW!!! Quite serene...Seattle has a great skyline. Although kinda small, the fitness center was modern and nice. The pool was nice too and had a chic feel to it. We even received free breakfast coupons, and the breakfast was superb. The service was a little shaky though, as they may have been understaffed. Great food though. Great location downtown; close enough to walk everywhere, but not too far from everything downtown.

<comment category="negative" id="UR37835274">I picked this 3.5 star hotel for location (Pike Place market) and style, although it turned out to be right over the freeway and not really where I would consider the Pike Place area. There was great (free) public transportation just a few steps a way so that was not a problem. The hotel staff was cold: check-in was efficient but indifferent; concierge was so full of himself that he did not even make eye contact or smile while he was on the phone. I finally walked away. After we unpacked, left and then returned from our day, we found the toilet did not work. They had no part on hand (for a toilet??) and the maintenance man told us we would have to pack up and move. The desk was unapologetic and sent us to another room, which turned out to be a corner room and extremely small. After 5 pleasant days about town, we would have taken this all in stride -- until the ultimate blow. My favorite, and one of a kind, jacket was left hanging in the closet when we departed to stay with a relative and when we called to retrieve it, it had not been turned in. We called for several days: the lost and found, then the hskp supervisor, then the GM, but they could not or did not attempt to retrieve it from the dishonest staff member/thief. The GM (had a french accent) even said "I will take this personally." We never heard from him. STAY AWAY. There are much better choices for hospitality and locations in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR37626647">We recently traveled to Seattle for a short vacation and stayed at the Renaissance. I was somewhat underwhelmed. The location is pretty good; not great. It's at the top of a large, steep hill, so if you're planning on walking around Seattle, be ready to make the the climb more than once (this is coming from a person who's in pretty good shape). It is walking distance to the ferries, shopping, museums, and the Pike market, but it isn't a short walk. It is also RIGHT NEXT to the freeway, so if freeway noise bothers you at night, then this isn't the place to stay. Our room was clean and fairly comfortable, although our reservation was messed up and we ended up changing rooms to accommodate our needs, which were communicated in our original reservation. The Internet service was $13 a day, which seemed a little high. The soap / shampoo in the room was horrible. This sounds like a small thing, but we travel frequently and I try to limit what I bring, so I've started depending on whatever is provided. Normally this isn't a problem from a 4-star hotel, but this time I felt like I was showering at the Motel 6 with the no-name soap and shampoo that smelled like cheap cologne. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and the service very friendly. However, we had our 20-year-old son with us and when we sat down to order a drink near the bar one evening, they ordered us out of the area because he wasn't 21. I can understand this since Washington has a strict law, but the area was large and not easily defined as being the "the bar", we weren't familiar with the law, and they were a bit loud about the whole thing which was embarrassing to our son. Overall, I wish we had stayed somewhere else.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR37356236">We arrived at the hotel after a long flight from Boston with our 1 year old. The moment we stepped onto the property, the staff helped us feel welcome. They checked us in early (around 1:30) and gave us a room on the Puget Sound side. A few hours later, we noticed our fridge wasn't working properly, and they arrived with a replacement within 10 minutes to make sure our daughter's milk was kept cold. We enjoyed the pool on the top floor (terrific view!), though were disappointed that the hot tub was not working at all during our stay. Because of the time change, we were up bright and early with our daughter (sadly, around 3:30am the first few mornings.) My husband and I would switch off taking her down to explore the lobby while the other one slept. The lobby was quiet at that time except for the cleaning staff, who were extremely friendly and tolerant of our daughter running around. The best part about this hotel is its location. It's very convenient to the highway, so easy to get to, plus its a short walk from Pike Place, Westlake Center (monorail to Seattle Center) and lots of restaurants and grocery stores. We almost stayed at the waterfront Marriott but ended up getting a much better deal at the Renaissance, and I was glad we ended up where we did. Traffic down near the water would have been a nightmare. All in all, we were very impressed with this hotel and would highly recommend it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR36804360">I spent one night at the Renaissance Seattle in August 2009 while traveling on business. I arrived very late on a cross-country flight, and it was a welcome relief to be greeted warmly by the friendly front desk staff when I finally arrived. Check-in took no more than five minutes and I had no problem finding the elevators and getting up to my room. When I requested a late check-out, the front desk staff was very gracious and was able to accommodate me. My room was large and clean. In addition to a very comfortable bed, it also had an armchair and ottoman and a large desk/workspace. The bathroom was not the biggest, but it was clean and had good counter space. I had a partial view of the waterfront, although it was mostly obscured by other buildings. High-speed internet worked well but was not free. I ordered room service for breakfast. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and polite. My food arrived in 15 minutes, exactly when I was told it would, and was prepared to order. The fitness center was clean but small. There was a decent selection of free weights and enough treadmills for everyone who wanted to use them. My only complaint was that there were only two ellipitical machines and both were in use for over half an hour. The waterfront is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, but be forewarned that the walk entails some pretty steep hills. I did the walk pretty early in the morning (about 7 a.m.) and the neighborhood seemed very safe at that time. Over all, this hotel fit my needs perfectly. It was clean, safe, friendly, and efficient.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35765441">My husband and I just stayed at this Renaissance last week while vacationing on the West coast. The renovations appear to be done, for anyone who is wondering. Our first room was a king bed, corner suite located on the 10th floor and it faced the incredibly busy I-5 interchange. We asked to be switched to another room the next evening - the roar of the highway was just too much - and thankfully they accommodated this request. Our second room was a standard king that faced the city and was on the 16th floor. MUCH QUIETER. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room away from the interstate. The hotel was very large, businesslike, and bustling at all hours so if you're looking for a romantic, cozy feel, this might not be the one for you. As far as location is concerned, the other reviewers are correct when they say that this hotel is located on one of the steepest hills in Seattle. Ladies, do not try to wear heels on Madison Avenue or you will bust your booty! Just be a bit strategic and cut up or down a street as there are others that are not as steep (or take a cab). Overall the hotel was located close enough to the sites that we wanted to see that we walked most days/nights. We did use the monorail at one point to get from the Space Needle area closer to our hotel's location and that worked great. Cabs were readily available outside of the hotel (lined up on 6th Ave). The rooms themselves are everything you would expect from a high-end Marriott. Granite countertops, lush linens, fine bath products... My only gripe is that the bathroom doors (in both rooms) are sliders and they did not close all the way; there was a 1" gap between the door jamb and the slider! Nor was there a fan in the ceiling or a lock on the door! So if you are on a business trip and must share a room, you may want to seriously consider another hotel. Or if you are on a "new hot date getaway" this is a possible deal-breaker. The bar upstairs (Visions Lounge) was fine for drinks and had spectacular views. Drinks were fairly priced. It was very hot in there when the sun was going down so perhaps they are having AC issues. The cafe downstairs served Starbucks and had a pretty decent selection of muffins, pastries, and fruit. A fully-stocked drugstore is located two blocks down on 4th and Madison. Overall we would return but we would certainly ask for a room away from the highway interchange.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR35123010">Stayed at this hotel for three nights in July 2009, travelling with teenagers. Room were comfortable, but our room on the 12th floor overlooked I5, the main interstate south, and the noise was was shockingly bad - could not sleep at all the first night we were there. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a high floor, away from the Interstate. Minor annoyances: not enough towels in the bathroom, in-room Internet connection would not work properly, room access cards kept getting desensitized. However, friendly and responsive staff made up for it. The hotel is well located, some six blocks from Pike Place Market. However it is at the intersection of 6th Ave and Madison St, a very steep climb from the waterfront. You will really regret not keeping in shape!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33139521">We attended a weekend seminar held at the hotel. The room was OK, the pool was small and too cool. We enjoyed tasty appetizers in the lounge/restaurant, and the severs were very friendly. We tried a walk around the block but the vicinity is not welcoming, a homeless man was camped on the stairs to the service entrance and glared at passers by. On our day of departure I got trapped in one of the 5 elevators, it malfunctioned and the door wouldn't open for several minutes. The prices were pretty high, and they charge a lot for parking, though you have no choice to park elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32488758">I stayed here one night for work and really enjoyed my stay. The room was very nice and the view was great. I found the bed to be very comfortable and loved the size of my room. The only draw back was the parking garage which seems to fill up very quickly and you drive down to the bowels of the building for parking, which is fairly pricey but probably in line with Seattle hotel rates.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR32229052">We stayed at the Renaissance on 31st May, after arriving from UK, we were departing the next day on an NCL Alaskan Cruise, so we were booked into this hotel for just one night. Overall for a nights stay it was fine, fast check in, great room with lovely big comfy bed (just what I needed after a long haul tiring flight), big flat screen TV, great bathroom. We ordered room service which was delivered within 20 mins, and was of great quality, we were so tired we just watched TV, ate our food and went to bed! In the morning check out was fast, and we walked a couple of blocks north to a lovely shop which sold everything and had a cafe attached to it - had mocha and muffin for breakfast before going back to the hotel to be picked up and taken to the port. The only downside to this hotel I think would be location, it isn't right in the centre of the shopping area, so if you want to do shopping stay nearer to that area (recommend Grand Hyatt).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR31914059">Don't stay there if you are a light sleeper. The hotel must have been built many years ago. The decor is pretty outdated although the room is clean. I am staying at 19th floor AWAY from the I-5 high way, and I still can here all street noise from the ground level! It's as if there is absolutely no sound insulation from outside! I know they are remodeling now, but I am not sure what they can do about this. The staff was pretty good. But, if you are a light sleeper like myself, avoid this hotel. Decent location though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR31505302">First of all, they let me check in at 10am to dress for an event. Then there was a small problem with the room so they upgraded me an executive corner suite with a view of the harbor, Space needle and Lake Union.. My wife would open all the drapes and admire the views day and night (a Grays Anatomy fan). Hotel food was outstanding and about 20% more than eating at a hole in the wall. A concierge found me wandering and offered to show me the hotelâ€™s offerings. The most memorable of which is the 28th floor pool and hot tub with a floor to cieling 2 wall view of the city. Be sure to take your swim trunks. I could go on but my final opinion is that it was the best value, treatment, and service I have ever received. When you leave the hotel, the hills are killers. I am retired and I used the free bus to visit all the sites.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR31250822">The hotel is currently being remodeled. Our room was very nice and newly redone. I'd suggest asking for a room on the 5th street side of the hotel. The other side faces I-5. The staff and everyone was wonderful. The pool and spa are quiet and perfect for a evening wind down. My only other suggestion is to avoid the hotel restaurant. The food was terrible and with so many wonderful restaurants in Seattle, anything is better than the hotel food.<topic>none</topic>

Upon checking in I inquired about breakfast and was told that there was not a free breakfast even though as part of my Gold Elite benefits it was supposed to be. On Saturday when we were getting ready to leave I asked for a late checkout of 2P (not very late) and without even checking was told that they could not accomodate my request.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR30962549">While not as plush as many higher-end hotels, the Renaissance was comfortable, clean, and provided friendly and good service. Parking was easy, though fairly pricey (~$33/night). The breakfast available in the hotel was actually surprisingly good (and reasonably priced for downtown). There are a few caveats, as a few others mentioned: the proximity to the freeway can be bothersome if you're a light sleeper (and get a room on that side of the building); the heating/cooling fan is fully automatic, regardless of what you push; the sliding bathroom door is neat, but doesn't offer much privacy. Overall, a good value for downtown, and in easy walking distance to Pike Place, dozens of restaurants, etc.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR30913446">I felt as though the price didn't reflect the accomodations. The service was good-to-great, and the hotel was very clean ... but for the amount of money you're putting down it just didn't seem that schnazy. I think you're paying for location more than anything. The internal restaurant was over priced, and the food was average. If I were to go back, I wouldn't stay here. And the fitness center was poor. And the charge for internet was overly priced. ... I did like the chocolates at the end of the day though!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR29318954">I stayed here in March for one night and several more in April. The front desk and housekeeping were very responsive and friendly both times. The hotel is being renovated right now, however, which is a bit of a drag, so for my July Seattle trip, I'm staying elsewhere. The room was clean and comfortable; everything worked in the gym and it was clean. Pool/jacuzzi with FANTASTIC views of the city. My room had a lovely city view (ask for a cityside room as opposed to a freewayside room). In March, I'd had a severe allergic reaction to something at the Hotel Monaco and fled to the Renaissance in the middle of the night. They let me check in a 3 a.m. with no extra charge. (Hotel Monaco, by the way, did nothing to help me in my frenzied state, like, for example, get me a ride. I had to trudge up the hill with all my stuff in the dark.)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR28651257">Wife and I used Marriott points to stay 3 nights in downtown Seattle. The room was OK, nothing special. The bed was very stiff and uncomfortable. We both had trouble sleeping most nights. Bathroom shower is outdated. Hotel undergoing major renovations. Hotel Gym was fine. Hotel is at top of a substantial hill, so get prepared if you are going to walk around Seattle. Hotel is in good location in proximity to most things in downtown. If you don't care to walk, the City buses are free to ride pretty much anywhere downtown.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR27536563">We thought we found a great value at this hotel until the hotel started to nickel and dime us. Twenty-eight dollars per night to park at the hotel, ten dollars per day per person for a continental breakfast, thirteen dollars per night for wireless internet, etc. They also make you pay tax on things such as parking and wireless internet. Additionally, we could hear the guests next door loud and clear. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up, the closet doors wouldn't shut, and their was no fan in the bathroom. These are the little things we expect from the Marriott brand. Unless you get a smoking deal here that offsets all the different charges, we suggest staying somewhere else.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR24642524">Great location right off the 5. The service was excellent...as far as service goes, they totally live up to the Marriot name. They accommodated my request to check in really early, to check out late and to have a room not facing the 5. The room was fine, except the bathroom was a little shabby. We were right by the elevators and it was just way too noisy to me. I could hear everyone coming and going, doors slamming, housekeeping and the TV in the room next door. The worst part was the parking. They charge $28 a night, and then sneak on a $5 "parking tax". So you pay $33 a night... As far as the walking...You can easily walk to many places, like Tulio down the street, but it is on a hill and if you want to go to Pike's Market, be prepared for a hellish hike back.<topic>none</topic>

We got an excellent deal through Expedia, which really reduced the cost of the hotel. I can't fault the hotel at all. The public areas were nicely decorated, the bar on the top floor had an excellent view and a good happy hour, the fitness suite had top-notch equipment and was usually deserted, and our room was a good size and very nicely decorated. Staff were all extremely helpful too.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR22613874">I lived in Seattle for many years and recently relocated away from this great city. I took a trip back to catch up with friends and see some local theater. I was able to secure a great rate at the Madison and had heard good things about the hotel from friends who had stayed in the past. The hotel is currently undergoing the massive renovation to the rooms. If you stay here be sure to request a renovated room. The hotel sits right on the freeway, so rooms on the East side of the building can be a little noisy especially down lower. I was thrilled to get a room on the 27th floor looking to the south UNTIL the earthquake started - or what I first thought was an earthquake. It turns out that the hotel health club is on the 28th floor and when someone decides to run on a treadmill it literally shakes the rooms below. This wouldn't be so bad, but they open the health club at 5AM and apparently there are some health fanatics out there that think a run at 5AM is a good idea. For those of us who prefer to sleep in on weekends this makes for a very unwelcome wake-up call. I don't know what the hotel management is thinking, putting the health club above guest rooms when the building clearly isn't insulated well enough to prevent this unpleasant intrusion AND opening the health club at 5AM. Granted this only creates an issue for a small percentage of rooms, but it's unpleasant if you end up in one of these rooms. Otherwise I liked the hotel very much. James at the concierge desk was extremely helpful helping even this jaded ex-Seattlite find new restaurants, fun places to explore as a tourist and shopping deals. He truly has his finger on the pulse of Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR22580404">This is my second stay in as many weeks. The first week, I was placed in a corner suite on the club floor. This review lost one star because the layout of the room was too closed in and not very comfortable to be in. The room had a small living area with a desk, large LCD TV, and a couch. The bedroom had a great view of the city, but small, and the bathroom was newly renovated. The layout of the room made you feel crammed. My second stay was in a normal king room on the club floor. This room was excellent! It was newly renovated, nice furniture, great linens, awesome view and plenty of room to roam around. This hotel is great for Marriott Reward Members. The club floor had breakfast, snacks during the day, a light evening dinner and desserts. The lounge on the 28th floor has an amazing view of the city along with a great happy hour!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR22577308">Ok - it is an older hotel but we were given a renovated room on the 22nd floor. The hotel does have that old smell to it...they should see about that. The room was lovely and all upgraded bath items. The view from the room and from the bar on the upper floor was fantastic. A nice walk to the downtown area and we had no trouble finding our way around. Parking is $28 a night and the drinks at the bar a bit pricey, but the view at night is wonderful. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel for adults who want to see downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20993562">My family (husband, toddler and myself) stayed here for a week while we were house hunting in Seattle. The room was located on the 23rd floor, view of the Space Needle (not facing I-5 or the water). We felt we were lucky to be in an already renovated room. My sister and her family spent one night on the 18th floor in a half-way renovated room. The bathroom still needed updating so it was very very old. So make sure you ask for a renovated room. I-5 was still a little noisy but we could sleep through it. Heating/cooling system was loud, so we kept it off during the night. Hotel staff was very helpful and pleasant, no matter what the hour. Hotel food was good. The hotel is located a bit away from Westlake, Pike's Place, waterfront. But we got use to walking up and down the hills, wasn't that bad for us. And yes, there's a Starbucks on every corner. A nice local market was located up the steet two blocks, quick walk. They have a Bank of America ATM inside. Overall, we were pretty happy with the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20968359">We visited Seattle last year and stayed a few days the Renaissance. It was a nice hotel. Great rooms, good size but always my all time pet peeve, two full beds in stead of one and when thereâ€™s only the two of us, the extra bed is wasted space! Great overpriced mom and pops convenience store down stairs. BAR closed too early. Staff was accommodating and pleasurable. Room service was quick! Food was decent. I had clam chowder. We mostly ate out because thatâ€™s why one visits Seattle right? We had great sushi at a spot down the hill and over tone to two blocks to the right (not left) but canâ€™t remember the name with great ambiance. (The only thing that sucked was that we came in at happy hour, but they charged us full price. We were so â€œhappyâ€� when the bill came since we were eating sushi and drinking on an empty stomach that we didnâ€™t â€œcheckâ€� the prices before paying). Parking was affordable and convenient for when we wanted to venture out far at night Overall, if youâ€™re in Seattle to view the city, itâ€™s a great hotel.<topic>none</topic>

The hotel's location wasn't bad either, within easy walking distance of most downtown attractions, though the steep hill on its doorstep is tough to negotiate after an evening meal! Speaking of food, the breakfast--especially the pancakes--was good. The staff were very friendly and helpful and even offered to store our bag for three weeks while we were in Alaska.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20235845">The hotel lobby is nice, but the rooms are small and dirty. I'm an Elite Member and booked a room using my rewards. We were put on the 14th floor with a view of a construction project across the street. The bathroom really needed tile work and a good cleanser. Bathroom products were not high end unless you think Suave is pricey. Some staff were completely clueless. My husband and I checked in around 4:00 and departed for dinner around 5:30. We returned around 7:30 and found a strange note and antique looking computer speakers on our bar (no there are no liqueurs or fridge). I read the note (not realizing the speakers were what they were) and thought someone from the staff brought us a sound machine to help us sleep (since the Courtyard where I stay often for business travel provides a sleep mask, sound machine, chocolates, and teddy bear all at no cost!), but I soon realized it was a note meant for someone else. I called the front desk to let them know the mistake and I had to explain a dozen different ways for the girl to understand what I was saying, although I highly doubt she had a clue after all since she sent two security guards to our room and they took the note and speakers from my husband as if they were going to detonate! Overall the place was a dump with unprofessional (and unintelligent) staff. If I would have paid for the room or I would have needed to stay longer than one night, I would have complained and found other accomodations.<topic>none</topic>

Staff were very friendly accommodating but i was a little disturbed by the fact that the engineer they sent up to sort out my wireless problems didn't knock and just entered my room with a key.

<comment category="positive" id="UR19452189">I've stayed at the Renaissance for business at least thirty times over the past two years and have had overwhelmingly good experiences. The location is within easy walking distance of downtown Seattle, including Pike's Place Market, the shopping district around Nordstrom's and tons of restaurants. The staff members are friendly and begin to recognize me quickly. The rooms are clean and the beds are really comfortable. The hotel is generally pretty quiet but I recommend asking for a room facing away from the highway because it can be a bit noisy on the lower levels. My only complaint is around parking. The streets around the hotel are all one way and the hotel parking garage is underground with a really narrow winding drive where you drive in the left hand lane. It can be a bit frustrating to get to the parking ramp and then a little harrowing driving up or down it as drivers from the opposite direction tend to drift into your lane while turning corners.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19438906">I was on the west coast for business and had my wife fly out to Seattle for the weekend. At the last moment I decided that to stay out by Sea-tac where my company travel person had booked me would be crazy if we wanted to do touristy stuff so I went on Priceline, bid really low and had it accepted by this property. After I read the reviews here, I was worried that I was going to be in a bit of a dump but was very pleasantly surprised. I called and asked for a king room on the opposite side from the highway. The staff were very helpful, honored my request and allowed us to check in before noon at no extra cost. The room was one of the nicest I have stayed in for a long time. It was decorated in what I now call thew "Zen" style with lots of wood and a huge flat TV which we never did turn on. Towels were large and high quality and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This is not the place to stay if you don't like walking. We do so it was not a problem for us. You can walk straight down Madison to the ferry but it is a steep climb back up. To go to other sites, cut across on 5th Avenue. The gradient is gradual all the way to Seattle Center. Just go down any of the cross streets to get to your destination.

<comment category="negative" id="UR18446158">I DON"T RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL. I stayed at this hotel in June. I thought that because it was newly renovated that it would look better than the last time I stayed here. I was so disappointed to see an old looking carpet which to me didn't look so clean. I'm not sure if they replaced the carpet at all. I have been to other Renaissance Hotels and they all look very contemporary, nice and clean. This Renaissance (Seattle) is so ugly, dark and dirty looking. It looks like nothing has changed sine the 70s. The price per night isn't reasonable at all.

<comment category="negative" id="UR18112368">I had a very disappointing experience at this hotel. The room faced the highway and if I looked out the window I could view either traffic jams or a construction project. Traffic noise could only be drowned out if you kept the room fan on. What was more disappointing, however, was the quality of the room and services. The furniture was shoddy and worn. On my second day there the hotel had run out of caffeinated coffee packets with which to make coffee in the room. Running out of coffee in Seattle??? While coffee was brought up to my room on the successive three days I was there, I had to ask for it each time. On my last evening, I specifically asked for coffee to be brought to the room and did not want a wake up call. Well--I got the wake up call before 6am (!) and no coffee.

<comment category="negative" id="UR17738432">We stayed at this Hotel the 1st of June. There was a group of us so we were all over this Hotel. It seems that some of the rooms on the upper floors have been remolded with new furniture, flat screen, etc. Our room on the 9th floor had not been. Lots of noise! We were facing the Highway and it was very noisy. However other people in our party stayed on the upper floors facing the back of the Hotel and didn't have problems with the noise. The room was nice enough. Not great but not bad. I did have one really disgusting problem. I drank out of one of there glasses in the room that are furnished. I had lipstick on and when I left the room later on that morning the maid came and washed the glasses in the room and let me say not with soap! My lipstick was still on the glass! I had seen stuff like this on 60 mininutes and never thought about it again, until now! So from then on I drank only out of there disposable cups. Everyone that worked here especially the Concierge were really nice and helpful. When you arrive they will give you a map of the city. The yellow part of the map show's where the bus rides are free in a large area of downtown. I felt pretty safe during the day. I walked all over downtown and took the bus several time's. (People are really great if you have bus questions). At night we didn't walk around at all! And were told not to be several of the local people. All in all its an ok hotel.

It came with free breakfast for 2 which the waiter extended into a full breakfast for 3. I think what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. They were all very friendly and accommodating and this made our stay. The room we had was large and well ventilated away from I-5. The roof level pool had great vistas of Seattle. The palce was very clean. The only drawbacks were the off center location and the colorless lobby. For us it was a good deal. For full price try for a more close in location. However it should be noted the hotel sits right on the free dwtown bus loop so that makes getting anywhere downtown easy<topic>none</topic>

In addition it was nearly impossible to move around the king size bed because there was no walking room. We had a room away from the highway but the road noise was still very bad. My wife didnot sleep a wink all night. In the morning we canceled the last 2 days of our reservation and moved to the TownePlace Suites near the airport. It was half the price and a much better than the Renaissance. This was the worst Marriott I have every stayed at. STAY AWAY<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR17091355">I read most of the reviews and I agree with some of them and others not. Yes, the televisions are old and there are no microwaves or fridges in the room. But in my opinion staying in this hotel all depends on where your room is located. I was unfortunately on the side facing Interstate 5 and I was on the 5th floor. The noise was definitely troublesome to say the least. It wasn't bad getting to sleep if you like "white noise" in the background, but if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night it was difficult to go back to sleep. It's amazing that the traffic on the I-5 was constant all night long... I mean at 3:00 am there was a lot of traffic coming and going. Overall, the staff was nice and there were some nice features in the hotel. I walked to a ballgame at Safeco Field and it was about a 20 minute walk. The hotel was within walking distance to most of the attractions. The library is one block away and you can use their internet and computers if you need to check your e-mail. You just tell the library staff you are visiting from out of town and they give you one free hour of internet and computer use. I didn't have car with me so I have nothing to add about the parking. I took the Gray Line bus from the airport and it drops you off right in front of the hotel. This was a business trip for me so I didn't have to pay for the hotel out of my pocket. If I had paid for the hotel I would not have been a little more upset about the noise.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16780602">From the moment we checked in, our stay at the Renaissance Seattle was great. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Although a bit small, the room was spotless and very comfortable. The food prices--including room service--were extremely affordable, and all the food we had was amazing. The fitness center was also nice, and the location was great for what we wanted to do--walking distance to Pike Place Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, Pioneer Square, and Safeco Field (although I wouldn't recommend the walk back from Pioneer Square or Safeco Field simply because it is mostly up very steep hills). I would certainly recommend this hotel to pretty much anyone looking for a great stay in Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16718867">I'm the first to admit that upon reading the reviews on TripAdvisor about the Renaissance Seattle I was really tempted to change my reservation - but given that I had an excellent rate (friend got me a discount) and the other hotels in the area were at least twice as much, I held my breath, said a prayer and hoped for the best. You really should see it for yourself and the only thing I regret about my stay is that I didn't take any pictures of the place to post here. The room renovations are up to date, trendy and stylish. I often travel for business and I don't usually sleep well in a hotel the first night but had no problems here. Television is now flat-screen - no fridge in the room but with turndown service nightly we got a fresh bucket of ice. Admittedly, the room size is a bit smaller than most, but they were still comfortable and roomy enough to hang out in for a couple of hours during the day. Someone in an earlier review mentioned not having a fan for the bathroom and there isn't a seperate fan (which I was worried about) but the four days I was there I never found it to be a problem. Infact, this bathroom often cleared out faster than some others in hotels that do have separate fans. Unlike some other Marriott properties, this one does have wireless in the rooms. If you have two laptops with wireless you either need to pay twice for the internet access OR someone will need to write down the access code and you'll have to take turns. I called the front desk on this and tried to get them to understand when you've got two people traveling, and two people with two seperate laptops that need to use their own laptop for business purposes paying twice for the service seems stupid, but I didn't win that battle. And the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They've got a great crew there and I would not hesitate to stay there again. Had dinner one night in the lounge on the top floor - relaxing, priced about what I would expect for a hotel restaurant/lounge, and incredible biews. The one downside is that it is a bit further away from the rest of the "toursity" area of Seattle, but it's not like it's an unreasonable walk either. Another individual suggested taking 6th when walking if you want it to be a little less hilly and that's a great suggestion too. There is a city bus that within certain areas is free and for a nominal amount will take you other places as well. Most things are within walking distance though. In the few days we were there we walked to the monorail that took us to Seattle Center, walked to Pike's Market, the ferry pier, to Pioneer Square, and to Safeco Field without any problem or troubles. I've stayed at a number of Marriott properties (have marriott elite status) and this is one of the nicest I've been to and would not hesitate to stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16592188">Business trip - first time to city and found hotel disappointing. The lobby area and other public areas lacked character. The bedroom was small and slightly shoddy. The restaurant was okay for breakfast but not attractive for evening (I didn't even go as far as looking at the menu). And to cap it all was the price. I found this hotel expensive and not good value for money.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR16536167">...and it is almost bright enough to read by. Despite the remodel, the curtains are very poorly fit to the window, which is recessed. Could be substantially alleviated by a better fit, and one of those short curtains that cover the top part, hung on the outside of the recess. I hate it when it is obvious that a renovation is done purely for visual aesthetic, and no member of management has ever actually tried to sleep in the room. Room on the 21st floor, on the opposite side from the freeway, is still pretty noisy, though not enough to bother me, since I use a white noise machine anyway -- but I pity the poor traveller who gets a low room on the freeway side, which also happens to face east, meaning the light problem is no doubt even worse. Otherwise, everything else about the place is nice, followiing the remodel. A much better hotel to look at than to sleep in, though.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16196682">So I read most of the reviews before staying here and, honestly, considered changing my reservations. I'm glad that I didn't. The place is very nice, located up some steep hills (if you're walking), there's construction going on and a freeway to look. But if you can get past that (we did, pretty easily, too) it's a nice property. Being a platinum member, I called ahead and asked to be upgraded. We got a room on the 26th floor with views of Seattle on three sides. Smallish room with a separate sitting area. Same floor as the club lounge, so that was nice. Hotel was clean, everyone acted very professional and there's plenty of things to walk to within just a few blocks. We didn't rent a car here and, if you can avoid it, I wouldn't do it. It's too costly and Seattle is a good cab city. I would stay here again, but would like check out the Marriott on the waterfront first, just for a little variety. Also, paid $135 with a VIP card, so all things considered, it was a very good deal.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15441449">Arrived at the hotel having requested a quiet non smoking room to be told that they did not have a one free, we were given one which overooked the very busy and noisy freeway and someone had been smoking in the non smoking room. We were also told upon arrival that the hotel was going through a refurbishment and to expect noise from 7am! We requested another room after just 2 hours sleep due to the high level of noise and were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was more noisy than the previous room. The rooms had double galzing which might as well not have been there. After zero sleep the next night I asked if there was an alternative room on a higher floor or a sister hotel which we could move to which was quieter...the night porter's very rude reply was 'well if you think we're paying for you to move your greatly mistaken' (I did not ask them to pay, only to see if they could get us into another hotel) after the tone of the porter, very little sleep in two nights and a wedding to go to the next day we decided to check out of the hotel at 11.45pm and move to a hotel closer to our friends (not part of the same hotel group), we were charged for 3 nights accommodation (which we think was disgraceful), the porter didn't even offer to call us a cab to get to the new hotel so we stood on the street corner for 30 minutes before catching one to a nicer, quieter hotel. I would not stay at the hotel again and would appreciate a reply to these comments.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14947404">I booked a 3 night stay on Priceline ($80/night Sat - Mon) and once I got the name of the hotel I did my research...I was scared after reading some of these reviews. But there was no need - this is a great place for that price. The staff was amazingly friendly and accomodating (brought a bottle opener to the room and changed my room as requested). The room was comfortable and nicely appointed. This room had everything that I would expect for this class of hotel. The renovations are up to date and stylish. Make sure to go to the 28th floor for a nightcap - the view is worth it! Parking is a little pricey but there is a surface lot about 2 blocks away on 8th that is $15 for the day - if you don't mind getting up early to buy the ticket. Street parking in the area after 6 PM is free so take advantage of that. If you plan on walking, you can avoid some of the hills by walking down 6th to Pike Street and then left to the market - it is a fairly flat walk unlike going down Madison.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR13244203">I stayed for one night at the Renaissance Marriott in Seattle. My room had a nice view of the city and was a larger corner room. The staff at the front desk and bar were exceptionally polite, courteous and professional. There was a group of 8 of us out for a girls weekend; 2 gals to a room. The hotel was kind enough to make sure each of our rooms had 2 queen size beds and that our rooms were nearby. About the only drawback to the place was that the bathroom didn't have a fan; other than that....no complaints!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10797301">I am surprised that as a part of the Luxury Brand Renaissance that Marriott allows this hotel to carry their name. Upon checking in, I was given a room right next to a noisy highway. The room itself was decrepit. Heavily worn out, Scarred furniture and no electrical outlets for a laptop. TV was circa 1985. I went to the front desk and asked for another room and was told there weren't any. I told them I was calling my travel agent. While on the phone, a manager from the hotel approached me and asked me to see if this other room was better. It was on the other side of the building which was quiet, but it was no less decrepit. Old worn out furniture, a very tiny room with occluded windows from water leakage and an iron with a broken handle and exposed electronics. One night is all is all I can stay. At $290 a night I was ripped off.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10371845">I stayed here for four days while attending a conference. I really like Marriott hotels and am nudging Gold status, so I was surprised when I got a cramped little room overlooking the Interstate. I complained and got a better room. Like so many hotels in Marriott's Renaissance chain, the Seattle Renaissance is old, tired and run down. The decor is early 1970s with carpeting that dates from that era. I noticed in the restaurant carpeting that was worn and stained. My room had dark wood and cabinetry that was cheap and ill fitting. I could not get my closet door to close properly. The lamp on my bedside table kept falling off. And as others have noted, each bed has a weird cloth headboard that is both unnecessary and probably unhygienic. I used the fitness center, but unless you got there before 5 am you were out of luck for a workout due to the limited number of machines. As I said, I am a huge fan of the Marriott chains. Why their Renaissance flagship brand is so consistently lousy, with the wonderful exception of the Mayflower in Washington, beats me.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10171603">I chose this hotel because I am a Marriott rewards member, and this was the closest hotel in the chain to my destination downtown. This was my third stay at the hotel, and once again I had to ask (after checking in) to be moved from a room overlooking I-5 even after I had specifically made the request, and was assured by the reservationist, that I would not receive a room on that side of the hotel. I understand that they need to move those rooms but the whole check-in charade has gotten old. However, the biggest complaint I had was the lack of free wireless internet. The fee for wired internet service is $10/day. The hotel staff I encountered during my stay were all very friendly, from the housekeeping personnel to the room service staff. They were the ones who made my overall stay much more pleasant. Next time I travel on business in the Seattle area though I'll probably stay at either the Spring Hill Suites or Residence Inn downtown - they seem to have the accommodations which more closely fit my needs.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR10000028">The headboard of the bed is covered with a fabric material that may attract uninvited guests. After traveling cross country, I decided to retreat to my room and take a nap before the afternoon conference I was attending. When I woke up, I felt an itch on my scalp/forehead and found not one, but two ticks. The ticks had not yet attached to my skin, so they were recently acquired. I had not been to any other location (straight from airport to Renaissance). I took the ticks to the front desk and explained the situation. The staff first offered to fog the room. I did not find this acceptable and was given a different room. The new room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel manager gave me vouchers for breakfast daily during the stay for the inconvenience. Although I had no further problems, I don't think I would stay again because of the tick problem.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8735922">This is definitely not what you would expect from a Marriott Hotel, and as a Marriott Rewards Member with silver status I know what I'm talking about. Tiny rooms, old scratched furniture, no minibar, no refrigerator, no in-room safe. Had a room to the I5, even on the 8th floor it was extremely noisy. The whole hotel needs a complete refurbishment. Definitely no 4-star location. Next time I'll have to visit Seattle, I'll try to get another hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8716531">From reading these reviews, it sounds like a complete different hotel than the one we stayed at. We stayed 9/12-9/15 and had a room on the "club level" floor 26. To say the rooms needed updating was an understatement. I am not usually one to care about what decade a style is in, but is a problem is when decades of dirt cause everyone in the room to itch and produce a rash. This was the case. Everytime we left the room, we could breath and did not itch. Return to the room and it began again. Carpet is a multi dark color which did a lot to hide the years of goodness knows what. We did not dare walk barefoot. Carpet was also tore up in every doorway and tiles were loose in the bathroom. Usually when a hotel remodels it starts with the most expensive room, so remodels are a long way off. Beds were beds, nothing special. Bathroom the size of a closet, forget closing the door, it was not possible. For those that need to know, friends of ours requested a handicap room because one of them is in a wheelchair. There is no handicap room! It is a regular room with a couple of shower bars as a minumum legal requirement. NOT ONE SERVICE PERSONAL other than check in and the bar of course, spoke complete and coherent English. You need to know this if you want to communicate with housekeeping staff, or anyone in the gift store. It is incredibly frustrating to tell housekeeping to please leave extra towels over and over and have to draw pictures. The so called "parking garage" is unmanned on entry and completely unsafe! You need to know this. It is in a dark, shadowed underground with exceptionally tight spaces. Elevators are not clear. You actually have to enter doorways to stairs and go up a flight to reach an elevator in some places. ANYONE can be in these stairways and believe me in this part of town, anyone is. BE CAREFUL! Check in however was a breeze, check out also. This is where the English speaking folks are hidden. And the bar too of course, where they want to take your money without aggrevating you. However, please note, my credit card has been charged twice for the entire stay and I am having the worst time resolving the issue. For some reason, they feel compelled to keep connecting me to the "front desk" of the hotel. These folks do not do billing. I am still trying after 2 days...<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8615982">I booked the Renaissance through Priceline and got a very good deal, more than half off the hotel's internet price. So, I was worried that the hotel would be dumpy. Thankfully it was far from dumpy. It was great! Fantastic location. Excellent service. We booked a king size room and were given a one-bedroom suite. It was nicely furnished, large and very comfortable. I am very picky about bedding and the bedding met my high standards. The sheets were high thread count, smooth and covered the comforter completely (top and bottom sort of forming a duvet). The complementary coffee service in the morning was great. They also gave us parking ($25) for free. The food was good in the restaurants too. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel exterior is under construction so it's hard to see the name as you are driving by. Note: The hotel is right next to the freeway, but the soundproofing makes it hardly noticeable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8579760">We live in Vancouver, BC, and often spend weekends in Seattle. Having used Priceline's "Name Your Own Price" function many times, we are always happy when we get the Renaissance. It's much nicer than the Crowne Plaza or the Red Lion, and waaaay better than the sketchy Holiday Inn Express that you can get stuck with on Priceline. The Renaissance lobby is lovely, the staff friendly, the rooms large, clean, and comfortable, the pool and gym very nice, and the location convenient enough. When we stay here we often walk to Pike Place, the Crocodile, and to the Space Needle and back several times during our stay. People who don't like to walk as much might find it a bit far from the Space Needle area, but that's why you stop at the NiteLite halfway for a drink! The hotel parking is atrocious, we only use it when we're going to Bumbershoot and don't want to waste time coming back to move our car. But normally we use street parking-it's plentiful, close to the hotel, and free during evenings/Sundays/holidays. I would never pay 260 dollars a night for this place, but for the three nights we have it booked this coming weekend we payed 258 dollars instead of the 700+ it would have been through their website. And that's during the Labor Day/Bumbershoot weekend when hotels are scarce. Seattle is an expensive hotel town. Even the Moore costs more than what we pay for the Renaissance, and it's a very budget boutique hotel. It's a good deal.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8448620">We got a great deal on priceline (&lt;$100/night) but were treated as if we paid full price. Room was nice with very comfortable beds - the complimentary coffee and cocoa was a nice start to the day. The location makes it easy to see the sites, although the hills make your walk a little bit of an exercise. The Grayline shuttle from Sea Tac drops you off in front of the hotel and is very inexpensive. We ate in the bar one night and had good food that was reasonably priced, otherwise we ate at restaurants on the water. . Taxi to the Victoria Clipper for the 2 of us was $10 with tip. Would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8371898">Hi My wife &amp; I just stayed there 2 nights.

Other staff are friendly too.We stayed in a Junior Suite, spacious and very calm. It was nice because we really caught up with the sleep we needed.

<comment category="positive" id="UR8204458">This is the third time that my wife and I have stayed at this property. The exterior of the hotel, its hallways and rooms appear to need some updating, as all appeared to be a bit worn. However, the room that we took was sparkling clean. The location of this Renaissance is great for touring the city, and it's tied with the Renaissance-Tobu in Tokyo, Japan for having the most accomodating and kind employees that I've ever encountered. Also, the room service at the Seattle Renaissance provided the quickest service, the most appetizing meals and the most food for the money that I've ever experienced at any hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR8056621">This hotel is really a mixed bag. It's in a pretty good location, although at the top of a big hill. The Grey Line bus shuttle bus from the airport stops in front, so that's convenient. The staff and service are very good, especially the wake up call with a tray of coffee. I've stayed here three times now, and clearly this place is in need of a renovation. The furniture is worn as are the carpets. But everything worked fine in the room I stayed in. If you can get a good rate, go for it. But there are much better hotels in Seattle. I stayed there mainly for Marriott points and nights and did get a very good rate.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7476714">Stayed here because it's where the conference meetings were scheduled. Took Greyline shuttle from airport, less than $20 RT. Meeting rooms were on Ballroom level, and the ground shook with vibrations from cars in parking garage. My 11th floor room was fine, comfortable- and even tho my window faced the highway I left the fan turned on and it drowned out plenty of the noise. Slept well- nice down comforter, friendly staff. Refrig and coffee maker would have been nice but comp. coffee in the morning was nice. I'd stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7277707">The staff was very friendly and helpful, check-in was a breeze, car was too big for their garage, so we received a voucher for complimentary parking at the Hilton (3 blocks away). The pool and hot tub were the best part: on the top floor with great views. They obviously remodeled this area, it was the most up-to-date in the hotel. The interior of the rest of the hotel and the rooms were clean, but a bit worn and dated, time to refurbish. Overall a decent experience for a priceline booking. Pros: - Friendly, fast service - Pool and hot tub, views and open late - Fairly clean Cons: - It's in the business district downtown, so it's few blocks walk to things that are open on weekends, but not too bad - Interior is somewhat dated, but okay<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7271992">Unless you get some sort of deal from Priceline or similar you should stay away from this hotel. The hotel just needs a good renovation throughout, and there are much better hotels downtown at this or lower price (I paid $229). I was in a corner room on the 14th floor facing the Sound, but the freeeway noise was very noticeable and the room was very cold because of all the glazing. The room was large, and I guess was probably very nice in the early 90's when it appears to have last been renovated. There are strange built-in drawers below the windows, the furniture is in bad shape, the lighting poor, and the desk is small. The heating was very noisy, and constantly woke me every time it came on. The front desk service was fair, but the lobby too needs an update. Overall stay here only if you get a deal or this is the last place with beds in the city.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7254569">I stayed at this hotel for two nights earlier this month. I've stayed at a number of Renaissance hotels in the States and in Europe and been very happy. I read the reviews here and was surprised to find a mixed report, but felt it was worth the risk - after all, I was trying to use all my remaining Marriott points for a free stay, and it's a category 5 hotel...how bad could it be? Well, was I shocked. The room was straight out of the 70s (or earlier). Worn carpet, worn furniture, ancient bathroom. It was satisfactory, and I was in no mood to move to a different hotel, but I thought about it. Then, I tried to use the Internet. Sorry, all, that just sucks at this hotel. I had to do several hours of work online and transfer a few files around. It was slower than an old fashioned modem (remember those?). I spent an hour on the phone with their Internet dept, and they kept claiming people at the hotel were sharing files which was overloading the network - they did make it slightly better. It took all night for the files to transfer at this hotel. For comparison, I had to do the same work a few days earlier from a Westin in Canada and was done in under an hour. Totally unacceptable. I should have tried my luck with the wireless from a neighboring hotel instead... There's absolutely no way I could be convinced to return to this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6779810">Like the previous post I was very concerned about staying here. I also payed $65 on priceline and figured you can barely stay at a motel 6 for that so what the heck. The front desk was very efficent I requested a higher floor away from the freeway and that is what I got 20th floor opposite freeway. The fitness center was clean with lots of equipment. The pool and hot tub were clean and pretty much empty. Our room was nice with down comforter and it was nice to get fresh air since the window opened. The shower had plenty of hot water. we recieved a complimentary Sunday paper and complimentary tea, coffee or hot chocolate delivered to the room. as for parking my husband was able to find parking on the street so we didn't use the hotel parking. Seattle parking is free after 6:00pm and on Sundays. Overall well worth the $65.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR6714063">We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It was a Friday,Saturday nite, I got it for $65 a nite on priceline. Wasnt sure what to expect, but the desk was as accomodating as it could be, rooms were clean. We had originally asked for a room facing away from the freeway as we would be sleeping in the day time. They did not have one avail, but gave us a freeway facing room on the 23rd floor. It was fairly quiet as long as you had the window closed tightly. Woke up every day to a news paper at our door. The thing that I was not prepared for was the $23 a night parking fee in the parking garage. Very low ceilings. Would not be albe to park there if you had an suv.

<comment category="positive" id="UR6622305">We stayed at this Seattle hotel for one night only in early December. We arrived late Friday night and were told that the highest floor they could put us on was the 4th floor. We had booked on Priceline, and are used to getting the "leftovers" as it relates to the rooms. But we were happy that they got us into a king-size bed. We didn't mind being "only" on the 4th floor, but I suspected that they are aware that there is some highway noise, and the higher up, the less noise. Nevertheless, the room was adequate - not luxurious. But we had paid a very reasonable price through priceline. If you have stayed in many "downtown" hotels, you know that there is a very high price to be paid for large perfect rooms without flaws. This room wasn't perfect, certainly, there was a chip on the bathroom door, that type of thing, but it was fine. And we didn't experience any troublesome noise from the highway. Mostly the reason that we are rating this hotel so high is because of the friendly staff and the great value we got on priceline. I would have been very unhappy with this hotel had I paid $150 or $200 per night. In the morning, at the breakfast buffet, we were treated to a wonderfully friendly server who couldn't have been more delightful and helpful. He helped us with our plan to walk down to Pike Place Market and chatted with us about the weather in Seattle ;-). The breakfast was fabulous and I don't think I've ever had a better waffle! The location is PRETTY good for getting to the Marketplace. The way there is all downhill so no problem. I would definitely recommend the bus system to get back. In the off-season, it's free. But it would be worth the small amount in the peak season as well. It is a very steep uphill climb to get back. We would definitely return but ONLY if we got a really good rate again. I would not pay over $100 for a room here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6482311">If you are thinking of booking a room at this hotel, JUST DON'T DO IT!!! I traveled to Seattle with 3 work colleagues for a seminar. We booked our room through Priceline, asking for a 3-star hotel in downtown Seattle, and got reservations at the Renaissance (supposedly a 4-star hotel). What a disaster! Half of us got rooms on the I-5 freeway side of the building. The noise there was so bad (large container trucks rumbling by all night) that we had to switch rooms. Even earplugs didn't help block out the noise. The rooms were also pretty shabby, with scratched up, damaged furniture. When we complained to the management and asked to switch rooms, they told us that the Priceline rooms were discounted rooms, so we shouldn't expect the same quality as "full paying guests"!!! We ended up having to pay an extra $25 per night just to get adequate rooms. The other half of my group got rooms on the other side of the hotel. There was construction going on from early in the morning until quite late at night. These rooms were also terribly noisy, but earplugs at least cut out much of that noise. The staff acted like complaints from guests about not being able to sleep because of the noise was old news that they didn't want to hear about. They acted indignant that we would dare to complain and were extremely rude and dismissive. Also, the ice machines were broken on most floors (we had to search 3 floors to find a working one) and there was no attempt to fix them. There was no minibar or even a mini refrigerator in the rooms. There was a spot where the refigerator used to be be, but they had removed them all. The Renaissance bills itself as a 4-star hotel. If that rating is based solely on the hotel lobby, I'd give it 3 stars. Based on the shabby rooms, the noise, the lack of service, and the rude staff, I would be stretched to give it 1 star! We will never stay at a Renaissance Hotel again!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6448752">The Renaissance Seattle tries to pass itself off as a first-rate facility, but it is not. The hotel was renovated in the not-too-distant past, but it still has the atmosphere of a gloomy, 1970s-era concrete bunker. Desk staff were reasonably friendly, but totally unknowledgeable, even of facilities in their own hotel. The rooms were less than spotless, and the hallways were literally strewn with dishes, glasses, trays, etc. that went unretrieved by hotel staff for about 12-16 hours at a time during our stay. Although we were staying on a non-smoking floor, the hallways also reeked of cigarette smoke for some reason. I found my bed incredibly uncomfortable -- the mattress was hard as a rock. Even worse, when we checked in, desk staff did not inform us that one side of the hotel faces the I-5 highway and is **incredibly** noisy, even 20 stories up, even with the window shut, even in the middle of the night. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. Had I known this, I would have requested a room on the other side of the hotel -- but better staff would have automatically tried to be accommodating, where possible. Parking, not surprisingly, was excessively expensive. In short, our stay was little short of terrible. I would recommend this hotel to my worst enemy -- no one else. Mediocrity, thy name is Renaissance!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6005502">We only stayed here for one night - which was a good thing..... The room was dark, the staff unavailable or somewhat dim. No-one bothered to pick up the phone in the restaurant or call us back after we left a message. I guess if it looks like a Marriott, and smells like a Marriott it is a Marriott even if it's called Renaissance.... The good thing was the location. It's close to the market and lots of fun restaurants.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5984209">Woud never stay here again. We pulled up to valet to check in and we were told that we had to park 3 blocks down because our chevy tahoe would not fit in the garage. I could not believe it! I told the bellman that for the price of the room ($250) I can't believe that you do not have parking for my vehicle. We had to drive 3 blocks away to park and then get a cab back to the hotel because it was miserable outside. Then when we checked out we had to hike 3 blocks to the car and then go back to the hotel to pick up our luggage.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5624793">This was to be a 13 day stay for business. There were several issues that were not fixed during my stay that prompted me to check out of the hotel and check into another. 1st being they put me in a room with an adjoining door. Because of this I was able to hear everything that went on in the next door. This included conversations, television shows and the adjoining door was being jiggled constantly. On Wednesday, my room internet stopped working. They continued to charge me $9.95 everyday for the service. Even though the hotel had other rooms available they would not move me. I finally gave up waiting for the hotel to do something and checked out on Friday.. walked several blocks and checked into the Fairmont. I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers. Privacy and having reliable access to the internet are too important to compromise.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5491106">The hotel is nice, but it is located between the major interstate that runs through Seattle and a construction site. So no matter where you have a room there will be noise. It is also located on a hill several blocks from the waterfront, so everytime we went for dinner or sightseeing down there, it was quite a hike. It is also a bit of a walk to the major downtown shopping area and other attractions. The rooms were fine, but the location isn't the best.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5441847">No problem checking in or parking as other reviews suggested. All hotels in Seattle charge for parking, so I went there expecting it. At least the parking garage is clean, well lit and equipped with an elevator to the lobby of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and met every request with a smile. The morning beverage option was a nice touch and my kids enjoyed it. Rooms were clean and well maintained. I wish the pool was larger but it was well tended and kept at a comfortable temp. Location is convenient as long as you aren't walking everywhere. We would surely stay again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5412745">We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last weekend. We arrived on Friday and left on Monday, and had no problem checking in or out, which took 2 minutes. The room wasn't too bad except we were assigned a room facing the freeway. The noise from the freeway didn't bother us at all and we were on the 10th floor. The bed was nice and comfortable. The most impressive service at this hotel was the concierge. Fred, one of the attendants took care of quite a few things for us before we arrived. He was very helpful and friendly, made some good suggestions to help us plan our weekend, saved us time and money. Overall it was a great experience and the service level was what we expected from a Marriott/Renaisance hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5407017">I slept wonderful here! I love down comforters and double sheets! My kids loved the indoor pool, and the morning hot chocolate. They left upscale shower samples, not your typical off brands. We got room service for dinner both nights, it wasn't terribly expensive and it actually tasted very good. The parking does cost 21 bucks, but parking is just expensive in Seattle. We got a great deal on the room, so I didn't feel so bad about the extras. We also paid extra for internet in the room, but for ten bucks you get all day internet and long distance phone calls. I would definitely stay here again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5361747">We booked at the Seattle Renaissance for a weekend trip after having great experiences at other Renaissance Properties in the past and having read mostly positive feedback on TripAdvisor. The trouble started the moment we arrived. To my utter astonishment, not one of the four valet parking attendants on staff knew how to operate a manual transmission. Maybe I'm a progressive thinker, but I would have thought that knowing how to drive a car would be a basic prerequisite for being a valet attendant. After parking the car myself, we found the lobby to be PACKED with people and the lineup for the front desk literally had dozens of people in it. It was obvious that it would take close to an hour to even reach the check-in desk. I have Marriott Elite status as a frequent Marriott guest, so after trying to get the concierge's attention for several minutes, I was finally able to ask him if they have a dedicated Elite check-in line as they do at many properties, to which he replied, "no, we got rid of that." Frustrated, we left and went to the W instead, where we had a great stay. Apart from our bad experience, the decor of the hotel appeared tired and dated. I realize that that it wouldn't be completely fair to blame the hotel for the timing of our arrival and the crowd in the lobby, but the combination of the incompetent valet parkers and the hotel staff's poor handling of the situation in the lobby will guarantee that I definitely won't book at the Seattle Renaissance again!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5234718">The Renaissance Seattle Hotel provided for a nice, spontaneous &amp; romantic getaway to Seattle. It was my first reservation made on Priceline. I was able to get a room at the Renaissance for $129/night + taxes. The hotel is in a good location, and it's the typical old but not quaint downtown hotel. We were able to request a king, non-smoking room with a view of the Sound and downtown at time of check-in. The bed was comfortable with nice linens and comforter. The only down side to the hotel room was the very small bathroom; however, this might by typical for an older hotel. I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR5067564">I've stayed at this hotel many times this year for business and have had a really good experience overall. All of the staff members I've encountered have been friendly, from the front desk staff to other staff members encountered on the elevators. The rooms have always been immaculate and the hotel is well-maintained. Room service is quick and the complimentary beverage service in the morning is great. The location is within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shopping. The only thing so-so thing has been the restaurant food and service at the italian restaurant inside the hotel. The prices are average and the service is slow so I'd recommend checking out the other restaurants in the area before eating here. It isn't that the restaurant is particularly bad, it's just that there are a lot of better restaurants within close walking distance. All in all, a great place to stay for business or to use Marriott points for a long weekend.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR4418361">I stayed here for 7 nights in July, 2005 and loved the hotel. The location is perfect...the new library is right behind the hotel, 10 minute walks to the downtown shopping core or to the water. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops within a 5 minute walk, too. My room was a good size with a nice bed. The washrooms were also a good size and clean. Service was good (a little too good maybe, hotel workers were knocking on the door to check on things 3-5 times daily). I ordered room service a couple of times and the service and food were both great. There is a pool and workout facility in the hotel which is pretty good, too. All in all, could not have asked for a better hotel. Keep in mind my company was picking up the tab, so I did not shop for prices. Would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

Guest services were outstanding, we had two employees ask if we needed help between walking in and getting to the hotel desk. We ate at the hotel's cafe on the 2nd floor for a quick bite after checking in and found the steak sandwich to be the most tender we've ever tasted. Hot water in the bathroom was almost instant and the towels were nice and thick. We paid about 100 a night through priceline and I think parking at the hotel was 21 dollars a night.

We could still hear all the noise. There were few restaurants, we walked a square 4 blocks down from the hotel and found nothing open at 2000 on a saturday The hotel's own restaurants were empty so we decided that would not be a good choice. The bed was comfortable. Then today when checking bank statements I find an unexplained $104 charge on my credit card. The real test will be "how many phone calls will it take to correct this mistake" This is really just a hotel.

<comment category="positive" id="UR4103882">I stayed here during an extra rainy stretch of weather with a girlfriend of mine in early November. While a an easy 10-15 minute walk to the Pike Place market area, the return to the hotel is not so easy; a four or five (short) block walk up fairly steep streets. The people working at the hotel are helpful, efficient and are willing to assist you at the drop of a hat; the only concern I have about their abilities are their errors and lack of knowledge about public transportation--they made casual mistakes about the bus routes from the airport and around the general area--look at the Seattle PT website before you leave! This is not a hotel best suited to the poorer tourist! As for the rooms, they are attractive, clean and have some stylistic leanings toward art deco, and are befitting the renaissance chain. My friend and I did worry about the darkness in the bathtub when the shower curtains are closed--they need some sort of lighting! The pool and fitness room were attractive, clean, though small, and would have had impressive views of south Seattle and the Sound if not fogged up! For the travel agent rate I booked the hotel for, the hotel was a fantastic bargain.<topic>none</topic>

The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had a really great view over the city. The service was friendly. Front desk was pretty slow as the hotel was fully booked so they were very busy. The pool was pleasant and the restaurant about what you expect in a Renaissance.

It is so near great restaurants and shopping. The walk down to water is easy. The walk back up is tough but we took cabs if we were down by the water. The hotel staff were very friendly and always said hello in elevators and around the hotel. The concierge staff helped us greatly and were very nice.

<comment category="negative" id="UR3658878">I got the room through Priceline for $70/night...which is not bad. Here is my take on the hotel and room: Room - I called the hotel a week before my stay to request a king bed and a quiet room based on the feedback I got from other folks on Tripadvisor. When I got to the hotel, I asked them again for the same requirements. I was given a king bed and a room not directly facing the freeway but still within viewing distance. In addition, the room was on the 6th floor so you can still hear the freeway noise. I requested for another room, but they could only give me one floor higher but still within viewing distance of the freeway. So, it didn't make sense to move. At this point, I was very upset since I've made my request ahead of time. However, I must admit the room was quite big for the price we paid and the bed was pretty comfortable. Wake up call w/beverage - I thought this was a great service the hotel offered. I got the hot cocoa and it was delicious. This sort of made up for my disappointment of the room. Parking - Parking in the hotel is expensive ($21/day). You can go to other garages for a bit less but you would need to move your car early in the morning. Also, you can park in the street at certain times for free but not the full 24 hours. So, I suggest not renting a car. However, we did find parking up the street past the freeway on 8th avenue which was free for the whole day, but availability is very limited. Late night cravings - the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main shopping/restaurant area...so not much choices nearby. However, we did find a pub that opened late and cheap too which was on 4th avenue... i can't remember the name. The pub was recommended by the concierge...so definitely take advantage of that service...they are very helpful. Hotel Staff - I have to say I was impressed with the hotel staff...bellstand, concierge, maid service...they were very helpful. One day during our vacation, it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella. I called housekeeping to request one and they made sure I got one. So, initially I was going to give a rating of 2 due to the problems I encountered with requesting a quiet room. But based on the customer service I received from the hotel staff...I changed it to 3. However, if you are paying full price...there are other alternatives you want to consider which are closer to the public market.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR125511776">This hotel was pretty nice with a fairly good view of downtown from the top story executive lounge. The service staff was polite and helpful and responded to requests and needs quickly and easily. It was well equipped for business travel with a print center, workout room, and irons/ironing boards in all of the rooms. The rooms themselves were simple and reasonably sized, with a desk, fridge, full bath tubâ€¦ Although the hotel was very clean and well designed, I was fairly surprised by the lack of decorations, design features, or classical touches a person would likely associate with a Hilton. This had little impact for someone like myself, however, due to the fact that I really couldnâ€™t give a damn about that sort of stuff. It is always nice when you stay at a hotel that has clearly gone to the effort of designing its space for aesthetic appeal, but I am much more concerned with the quality of staff and the cleanliness of the rooms and facilities than I am about anything else. This is not to say that this hotel was a cold war era bunker or a whitewashed psych ward. It was, in fact, very nice and veryâ€¦normal, and was only surprising in that it did not really lend itself to the vibrancy of Seattle or even the natural vigor or the Pacific Northwest.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR125099707">This little hotel has a great location in downtown Seattle. Around the corner from the 5th Avenue Theater. The only entrance to the hotel from the street is on the corner of 6th Avenue and University. There is a place in front of the door to park the car while you unload your luggage, etc. Unfortunately, the theater was getting out at the same time we arrived and the cars from the parking garage, attached o the hotel, were using the 'unloading' spot as a turning lane. We then tried to get into the parking garage and had to carry all of our bags to an elevator that took us to the 12th floor to check in.... The room was very nice, great amenities but I doubt we will ever stay again. I would give this hotel a higher rating but still feel it's lacking in making it easier to access.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR124841194">We went to Seattle for the weekend. Our stay started out wrong at the front desk, when the executive room with king I reserved was not available. Apparently a geology conference was being held the next week. I could have two doubles executive or king regular, or a king in an odd corner room on the executive floor. We went up and looked at the oddball room which was smaller than the usual but was otherwise pretty good, nice view. We took it, and got a $25 discount and breakfast coupons too. The inconvenience was about made up for. In the room we noticed things like there was no fan in the bathroom, and not much heat either. There were a couple of ordinary water bottles with $5 price tags on them. It was near impossible to find channels you didn't have to pay for. Breakfast buffet would have cost $21 apiece. Parking $29 per night. And the final insult, wireless Internet for $10.95. We were feeling nickeled and dimed at every turn. This surprised me because the room was not cheap in the first place.

The troubling factor was that the room was in poor shape. The wallpaper in the bathroom was bubbling off and it was not the cleanest. The carpet was dirty, not at all what I had expected from and Executive floor room. Their restaurant was OK . I had met a client there and we had to be put in the back where the overflow went.

It is just an avg. hilton, but it has a very good location and seems very reasonably priced and thus the 4 out of 5 given good value for a slightly above avg. large city Hilton. Rooms &amp; baths were not overly small as some indicated, but again avg. The views varied greatly. The city w/ water view is what you want on a high floor. As others indicated, the breakfast on the top floor is very good and the top floor is the lounge in the evening which was significantly better than the avg. Hilton Honors Lounge. I would recommend this property particularly for HHonors members. The Homewood suites are bit further away although one is right down on the water but the water is a nice 5-8 minute walk from here.

There is no way of accessing the lobby from the street but you have to go up an elevator. The lobby is the smallest plainest one I've ever seen!! Staff were friendly Access to the exec lounge was available (HHonors) and the food was plain and the soft drinks were free but you had to pay for all others. The view from the Top was nice though. The bedroom was tiny and dated but the bed was comfortable. Breakfast the next day was really quite good and eating at the top (28th floor) was an added benefit.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119338399">First, great location. We were there for 4 days on business trip. The trip was set up as direct bill with credit card needed by our company employees only for incidentals. Instead, the front desk billed some of our guests for entire stay taking funds from their debit or credit cards. It took a few days to have funds reversed. The rooms are small and out-dated, even on the executive floor. Finally, the management decided to do some plumbing work and shut off all water to rooms one night in a large section of the hotel at 10pm. They said the water would return by 4am. At 7:30am the water was not back on, so toilets could not be flushed, showers weren't available, etc. This lack of water on a business trip made the experience aggravating and uncomfortable. It reflected poor decision-making on the part of the hotel management as it affected many guests.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118772352">Handy location and walkable to pikes peak Market, monorail for space needle. Hotel is 40 years old and rooms need upgrading. Air con unit in our room was very original and was so loud that we couldn't have it on at night, the toilet flush was broken and the shower control was missing parts. That combined with a very small bathroom and generally small room, made the price seem not good value. The staff (front desk, bell boy, concierge) were all excellent- friendly and helpful.<topic>none</topic>

Easy walk to Pikes Market. Rooms were clean &amp; beds comfortable. We did have one problem about 10 pm a drunk man in only his underwear holding a belt tried to enter our room! Hotel Security came &amp; took care of him. Felt very safe in this hotel traveling with sister's &amp; 2 yr old. Bellman very helpful with transportation to pier 91.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118003342">We booked this hotel for our two night pre-cruise stay. It was definately the right choice. Location was wonderful, really close to all the downtown attractions .... Pike Place Market, Great Resturaunts, Water Front Area &amp; Shopping. We stayed on executive level (25th floor) which gave us breakfast vouchers for both mornings. The vouchers are good for complimentary buffet or a value of $14.95 to order off the menu. Buffet is on the top floor with a outstanding view of Seattle &amp; Cruise terminals! Staff was excellent. We used the hotel concerierge to book a few tours &amp; dining arrangements. All recommendations were spot on GREAT! We were even surprised with a complimentary appeitizer one night at dinner from the concerierge!!! Room was beautiful &amp; beds were comfortable! Everyone states how small the bathrooms are (????) It was not that small. We found everything to be satisfactory. Turn down service every night with two free bottles of water and a free news paper in the morning! Staff was around every corner wanting to help you in any way possible! When we are back in Seattle I will make it a point to stay here again! AAA+<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117985550">We stayed here for the U2 concert. The rooms were great. View was nice. Price was reasonable. Would definitely stay here again. The location was the best part if you want to enjoy downtown Seattle. Easy to get to from the I5 coming in from Canada. The only small wierd thing was how the lobby was on an upper floor because it was separated from the ground level by parking. Also sucked abit they didnt have valey parking but then again nice not to have to pay for it like you do at the Sheraton next door.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117850758">Great stay for two nights. Upgraded to executive floor because of Hilton Honors. Room /bathroom as others state is small -but met all my needs. It was updated and absolutely comfortable. Perfect. Breakfast for Hilton gold is free- it was really nice - fruit fresh, smoked salmon cheeses cereal omlets etc. I ate dinner in lobby lounge and has a great salmon / shrimp salad on very fresh lettuce. Delicious. Worth $18.00 to relax with salad and wine. The hotel is very close to shopping and Pike market. Close to my meetings which was near Seattle Art museum.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117841567">Stayed here because of the government rate that is within state per diem. A little out of the way and doesn't feel like a Hilton. The hotel has an odd smell--like fresh air never gets in the building. The rooms were very average and the bathroom very small. Although I am a Hilton Honors member there was no acknowledgement or room update that I usually receive. Food was typical bad Hilton and over priced. Arrived late so didn't really have any other choice. But definitely many better Seattle restaurants for the same price or cheaper. What I will have to say is that down to a person the service was outstanding. Every staff person went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. Everyone was personable and tried to give you little tips to make your stay better (e.g., the escalator was out at the metro station). Just need to take this outstanding staff and give them a better hotel<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117777568">We stayed for a night in September to sightsee in Seattle before moving on to Hawaii for the rest of our vacation. The hotel is well situated for everything we needed to see in the City and close to excellent restaurants. We were allocated a great room on the 25th floor with access to the Exec Lounge where complimentary canapes were served from 5-7pm and drinks were available thereafter. This was the same place where breakfast was served next morning - great views across the bay to start the day. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and we felt welcomed and valued guests. The hotel is showing signs of age and the room decor is a little dated but all in all we were very happy with our experience and we'd recommend the Hilton Seattle for your stay in the City.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117462491">I had some medical appointments at Virginia Mason Medical Center in downtown Seattle. My first appointment was at 7:20 a.m. so I decided to stay at the Hilton the night before to avoid having to deal with the crush of morning commute traffic. It turned out to be a good decision. If you can walk to the hospital, this is an especially good place to stay. Out the front door, it's one block over and four blocks up the hill to Lindemann Pavilion, where you need to stop and check in (for the hospital). A note of caution, for patients who can't handle hills, it's best to take a cab or find some other way to get up there. Even so, it would be a very short cab ride so the fare would be low. The good news for walkers is, it's all downhill when you are done at Virginia Mason! Wife and I really enjoyed the Hilton. One of our favorite places, The Brooklyn Seafood, Steak, and Oyster House, is four blocks down the hill from the hotel. We had to stagger back up the hill to the Hilton after having consumed a memorable meal, but it was worth it! The hotel was fine, it seemed there were staffpersons everywhere just waiting to help you with questions, etc. Very helpful and courteous. Our room was clean and quiet, though as noted elsewhere the bathroom seemed a bit small. We received our HHonors amenities and even a champagne and chocolate gift in honor of our wedding anniversary. I highly recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116709845">I made reservations online; I called because we were going to be arriving after 6:00 PM due to the ferry schedule. When I called they said no problem, we have plenty of rooms. On arrival, they told me they didn't have any rooms with 2 double beds - which is what I reserved, and that they had a King room that they could put a rollaway bed in, but it would be tight - and he could move me for the next day. Then finally another staff member said to check again that some rooms had been released. We were only staying 2 days. This could have been a nightmare, because my friend and I were being joined by my son for the second night. As it was there was no sofa or hideaway bed for my son and he slept on the floor. Thank goodness he had no problem with that.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116688537">My roommates and I headed to Seattle for the Emerald City Comic con, to visit friends, and to take in downtown Seattle's famed landmarks and sights. The hotel was very easy to find from the highway, and parking was a breeze. These are important points to note, as we were ready to get off of the road after our three hour drive from Vancouver, BC. As a member of Hilton Honors, i enjoyed a quick and easy check in with the gracious conceriege. Again, this was very welcome, as were the lovely green apples available at the front desk. Our room was large, clean and included a many useful amenities. The beds were very comfortable, and easily accommodated two people each. Likewise, the bathroom and vanity area left plenty of room for us to get ready at the same time. The location of the hotel was central to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. We walked to the convention centre each day, past lots of terrific shopping, and right down to the famed Public Market. The Hilton Seattle was in close proximity to the best that the city has to offer. Next year, when the ECCC rolls into town, on our next shopping excursion, or when visiting the Pacific Science Centre, you can be sure I will once again stay at the Hilton. Great value from a brand you can trust.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116450537">This hotel has a great location and the lobby area is very clean. The thing that put me off was upon entering our room the light (shade and all) next to our bed was dangling off the wall. We called and had that fixed the next day since we arrived at 2am. Also, we needed non feather pillows. It took them 45 min to deliver them. I would've gone down and get them if that was going to be the case. Also, the room just seemed dated and quite honestly not that clean. But I am kind of a clean freak. I would not stay here again as I am sure there are other hotels with a similar location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116367600">When my husband and I were booking a hotel for our recent trip to Seattle, we tried to book the Grand Hyatt and Hyatt Olive 8 because we've stayed at both before and found them to be exceptional. We were very disappointed to find that both hotels were full for the nights we wanted. My husband suggested that we try the Hilton, reminding me that it was closer to much of the "action" - Pike's Market, shopping, Safeco Field (well, that is about a half hour walk away), We booked our two night stay online. One of the options was to book a room which gave us access to the Executive Lounge (room price was around $210 Canadian - internet and parking extra). When we arrived, we went for a drink to unwind after our day of travel. The Executive Lounge had a great selection of appetizers (free of charge) and reasonably priced drinks. Unfortunately, we had other plans for our second day and we didn't get back to the lounge. The room also included breakfast both days. We were given the choice of ordering from the menu or going to the buffet. The buffet had a good selection of breakfast food (eggs, sausage, bacon, breads of all varieties, cereal, etc.) but also had cold meats, fruit and some fantastic lox to go with your bagels and cream cheese. The service was fantastic - they were quick to bring us our own coffee pot and the staff was extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is undergoing some renovations (most seem complete) but they didn't interfere with our pleasant stay. Our only concern was that parking was at a premium. The first day we had no trouble finding space, but after arriving back at the hotel around 7:30 on the second day, it was so busy that the hotel manager was directing parking and we were directed to go to the 9th (and top) floor to find a spot. This was likely because it was a Saturday night and there was at least one wedding reception being held in the hotel. All in all, it was a wonderful stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, or to recommend this hotel to anyone!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116116118">You notice when a hotel pays attention to the small details, the kind that make a property excellent . . . and you notice when they don't. On the surface, this Hilton looks fine: the lobby is decorated in traditional sophisticated tones. The rooms are large with modern furniture and nice flat screen TVs. The staff is super friendly. But once you start paying attention to anything beyond the gloss, this hotel loses stars quickly. First, the bathrooms are tiny. Like, so small that the door can't stay open because it runs into the show curtain. Considering that most of the furniture (the desk, the dresser) in the room was clearly too big for the space (pushed side-by side, with no space between them), I would have been willing to sacrifice a couple of feet in the bedroom and smaller furniture for a slightly bigger bathroom. The upstairs restaurant was closed for rooftop repairs, so breakfast was served in a large, windowless conference room that was eerily quiet. Okay, these things happen: repairs must me made, and they had to serve breakfast somewhere. But the food was awful and expensive. My Garden Scramble was overcooked and dry. My husband's french toast was better, but fairly gummy. And the two together cost $37. That was the amazing part -- they stick you in some large conference room with awful lighting and no ambiance, and don't think to reduce their prices at all. The next night we got a chocolate lava cake to take to our room. It was advertised as having a warm chocolate interior. And when we bit into it, it was cold, cold, cold. Okay, still delicious (it was chocolate, after all), but another example of how they just don't pay attention. The internet is expensive at $10.95/day. My husband and I have separate computers, so before paying for the internet we called downstairs to ask if the daily charge would cover both of our devices, and we were told yes. Then were charged twice, and were told it's because we used two devices. They did remove the extra charge for that one day, but said in the future it would be $10.95/device/day. Over all, the hotel was fine. The location is convenient, and I'd recommend it only if you get a really good rate, and aren't parking your car.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR116097232">I previously had a problem with Hilton Hotels but I gave this one a try on my last trip and was presently surprised. The best part was that there was free wireless internet in the lobby which was also the lounge so you could drink wine and cruise the internet at the same time. Also the rooms were first rate accommodations and I would have given this hotel the highest rating but I had a small problem with one of the night desk managers which I was able to correct in the morning before check-out.<topic>none</topic>

When we asked about free Internet and breakfast and etc...we were told rudely that we are not elite guests but they never told us how and explaint it to us.

<comment category="positive" id="UR114589660">My Mom, brother, &amp; I stayed at the Hilton Seattle pre/post Alaska Cruise (via NCL Pearl). The location of this hotel is just awesome (IT'S WALKING DISTANCE TO EVERTYHING), and two blocks away from the Train that takes you to the SEATAC airport! We were located on the 20th &amp; 21st floor. The rooms are pretty quite, but you could hear noise from adjacent rooms if you were in the hallway, but not like that is a big deal and it's something that can't be prevented. There weren't many places to eat near the hotel, as we were there on Sunday on both days, but there is a Rock Bottom Brewery &amp; Restaurant located just a block away. All-in-all I think if I were to visit Seattle again, I would most likely stay at this Hilton Seattle!<topic>none</topic>

You are right in the middle of the city, close to most everything. Very safe area as well.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR112335204">We received excellent service at this location, and it is in a prime location. However, our tub did not hold water (a problem for a daughter who still takes bathes), the cordless phone was not charged or plugged in (plug hidden behind heavy headboard), and the chest of drawers were all off of the track with one being completely broken. These issues were called down to the front desk and they promptly (within 5 minutes) had maintenance in our room fixing the tub (it worked after the change) and the phone. Excellent service and attentiveness, but the building is definitely showing its age, and some of the extraneous trim work was shoddily done (crown moulding being mismeasured and miscut). I would recommend this Hilton to anyone visiting Seattle as it has a great staff and excellent location, even if some of the problems border on hilarious.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR112113165">For the standard one expects fom a Hilton Hotel, this one was a great disappointment. The entrance on the ground floor is very poor and the lobby on the 1st floor is not much better. Both the ground entrance and the lobby are mor typical of a 3 star hotel. The rooms are typical of a 3.5 star hotel. Bathroom extremely small, toilet no lid. Bedroom is OK. The safe did not work at all and was clearly broken and needed attention. No hotel restaurant available for dinner. Limited food available in the lobby/bar lounge.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR111687175">We traveled to Seattle from the San Francisco Bay Area by Amtrak and stayed two nights at the Hilton. The location is good. I would describe it as an upscale area of the business district. A beautiful view of the Sound or Bay from our window. We had a bit of a walk to Pike Place Market that was mostly flat, then downhill for about a block. The area is beautiful, so walking around was no problem. The room was very nice and clean. The hotel was quiet. I really appreciated getting away from the tourist hubbub each evening. The only downside, there was not much in the way of dining onsite for a family with small children. There is a bar off the lobby with a few tables and chairs and this was the "restaurant". I thought the limited menu looked pretty good for a business traveler, however, for children ages 6 and 11, not many choices. (I suppose that most visitors to Seattle prefer to eat out since there are so many excellent restaurants.) The hotel staff readily recommended a family friendly restaurant (Rock Bottom) less than 1/2 block walk away, which was a very good pizza/brewery with a varied menu but specializing in gourmet pizza choices. So, the inconvenience was very minimal. In fact, when we got to the restaurant, there was another family from the hotel that had been directed there by staff.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR105618443">I stayed at the Seattle Hilton during April 2011. Frankly I do not understand all these wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor. My tab came to roughly $300 a night for an "Executive Level" room with breakfast. Other than the location the Hilton really has nothing going for it. There are a slew of better hotels for the same rate within spitting distance. The bathrooms are tiny, the shower head was "free floating in the wall", meaning it was not affixed to anything other than the pipe in the wall and at 8:30 am housekeeping banged on the door even though we had put the do not disturb sign on the door the previous night. There was a huge water leak stain on the ceiling above the beds. I very often stay at Hilton hotels and book the Executive Floor rooms, because I like the Executive Lounge idea: complimentary hors d'oeuvres and drinks in the afternoon. Well, guess again. The Seattle Hilton must be the only Hilton I have ever stayed at that charges for this. And conveniently, for them at least, they will not tell you at booking time or when one shows up at the lounge that one is being charged for all this, until one leaves and is presented with this unexpected bill. Choose another hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR104541334">I stayed at the Hilton Seattle for 8 days for work. The hotel is in a great location. Right in downtown, close to Pike Place Market, and all the major steakhouses. Great brewpub 2 blocks away called the Tap House, right across the street from Morton's. Tap house has 150 different beers on tap. Front desk staff was very helpful, as was the concierge. We asked the concierge to book 3 of us a table at Daniel's Broiler for dinner. She got us a table right by the window, and a free appetizer of 2 shrimp, 2 oysters, and 2 dungeness crab pieces. Nice! The woman at the front desk had me booked with a corner room, but when she saw how tall I was, she recommended the handicapped room, with the bigger bathroom. Try to get that room if they tell you that you have a corner room. One of my colleagues almost got stuck with a corner room. That room apparently has no desk (just a coffee table), and you need to be under 5'8" to use the shower! He ran right back down to the front desk to have a room change. I was charged $189 a night, AAA rate, for a standard king. Normal rate is $199 a night. Breakfast at the Top of the Hilton was great, but so expensive. $15 for the continental buffet, $22 for full hot buffet, and an a la carte menu as well. I didn't care too much since my company was paying, but take note of the prices. They serve a great Eggs Benedict. The food and the view was great from up there. Next to the front desk is the hotel bar and lounge. Very comfortable seating, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Room was clean, bed comfortable. Bathroom a great size. It had shampoo, conditioner, soap, and a hair dryer. I had a nice desk for my laptop. You can print to the hotel printer in the Business Center for free. It is located behind the concierge. There is an instruction card on the desk that tells you how to print there via a website called printspots.com, that will print to that printer. It came in handy for me when I wanted to print out several things. After you print your items, you go to the printer in the Business Center and type in the PIN you selected, and the items will print out for you whenever you want. You do not have do rush downstairs after you print out anything. The parking garage has a lot to be desired. Very tight corners, and tight spaces. I had rented a Dodge Charger, and I was a bit concerned. Just be wary of that. Hotel will get you for about $34 a day for in/out garage privileges. Also, make sure you know which floor you park your car on. I don't know how many times people walked off each floor to look for their car, and run back in the elevator, to go to the next floor! I was guilty of that too! Internet is $11 a day. Both wired and wireless worked fine from my room. On checkout, if you see a room charge on the last page of your bill called 'Shops,' don't be alarmed. That's the total of your Internet charges. I was alarmed myself, until the front desk called Accounting to allay my fears. All in all, a good experience.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR103952511">My husband and I have spent about 6 weekends in Seattle over the past 2 years. We have stayed at the Red Lion, the Fairmont and the Hilton and this is the one which definitely suits us best. What we appreciate about the Hilton is that the service is always good from the lobby to the top floor. The rooms are small and a bit old fashioned but clean and very comfortable. Above all, we enjoy a lot the top floor beautiful view. The first time we were there, we were no gold members yet and we could only enjoy the view when having our breakfast. Now we are upgraded whenever is possible and we can enjoy it in the evening too, while having a snack and drinking a gin tonic! Last weekend, we forgot our iPhone charger in our room. We called the reception on Monday and they sent it back to us immediately. We received it by Fedex this morning! Just a pity that their croissants and "pains au chocolat" were too dry in the morning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR102926526">Booked two rooms at the Hilton in downtown Seattle for one night. We were arriving around 10:30 pm on Amtrak from Seattle and heading out on another train in the morning. Around 8:30 pm our train was held up because of an accident ahead of us. When I realized that it would be past midnight before we got to the hotel I called to ensure that our rooms would be held for us (enough though we had a credit card guarantee). The lady at the front desk told me that it would not be a problem. She then noted that I had requested connecting rooms with two double beds. She told me that they didn't have connecting rooms with two doubles, but had a king and two doubles that connected. I told her that it was perfect as the king would be for my wife and I and the two doubles for our two kids. Well, as the saying goes, a late train only gets later. It was just after 2 am when we finally arrived a the Hilton. The lady at the check in desk welcomed us and had our key packages all ready for us. She had me show ID and then handed me the keys. "I have had the connecting door opened for you and the beds have been turned down", she said. "I have also taken the liberty of giving you a late check out of 3 pm. Does that work for you?". I thanked her very much and we headed to our rooms and immediately went to bed for some much needed rest. Rooms were standard hotel rooms and beds were very comfortable. However, the main focus of this report is the excellent service that we received. Our needs were anticipated by the hotel staff ahead of me even asking. That is very rare in the service industry these days. Had breakfast in the restaurant the next morning and the server was very helpful with directions and things to do while in Seattle. Obviously took pride in his job and in promoting tourism in Seattle. Bell man was very helpful in getting us a larger cab for us back to the train station. Excellent, excellent service by this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR99285097">Given the point of our weekend getaway was to be centrally located, this fit the bill. However TINY size of the bathroom felt like an airline lavatory. Very few extra's in the room such as adequate coffee, no mini frig unless you had a key to the minibar, which was packed anyway. All things pushed you to buy from the hotel, which here too was very over priced. Wine selection was minimal at the lounge and way over priced for the quality/selection. Overall the hotel was clean, lobby, room, lounge, restaurant, etc. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. Finding the lobby was an odd placement (not on the street level). The blackout curtains did little and the light from the hall came in through the door jam causing me concerns about security. At least use of the room safe was free. However the staff was accomodating to a late check out - but that may have more to do with my level of Hilton points than anything else.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR99267976">Look, this hotel could stand a makeover. The decor, and especially the carpets, are from 1988. Time to change. Other than that, everything about this hotel is great. The service was fantastic whether you are checking in or at the bar. I'm not sure if it was because I am a Diamond with Hilton or that I'm good looking, but the woman at the front desk called up after I checked in to see if the room was ok. Probably the former. The staff in the hotel give this place a really good vibe and I would and will 100% stay here again. The location can't be beat as it is walking distance to everything you want in Seattle. Oh, there is a rental car company within the hotel, so that makes it perfect for day trips.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR98846004">I'm just finishing a 3 night stay at this property. It's a good full-service property with all the usual things you'd expect from a Hilton, except perhaps a pool. It does have a lounge/restaurant at the top floor called creatively, "Top of the Hilton." They have a breakfast buffet in the morning and a decent spread of cold and hot apps in the evening from 5-7PM. The room is pretty standard. The bathroom, however is super small. I don't know if I could close the door if I was seated on the toilet. And the bathmat they give you doesn't fit in the room. Not a good sign. I asked for a room with a larger bathroom, but they said that all of the rooms were the same in that way. The hotel is fine. Parking is super expensive, but it's pretty standard. If you're a HHonors person, I would rather stay at the Arctic Club. Much more charm, bigger rooms and a cooler place.<topic>none</topic>

Parking is high, but normal for downtown ($32/day). I rented a car at the hotel for ($17/day) and just returned it each night to save on parking. Alamo &amp; national are located in the hotel.

<comment category="positive" id="UR93206816">I stayed at this Hilton for a conference at the Seattle convention center. As others have noted, the entry is odd, but perfectly workable thanks to fast elevators, the rooms are a bit small, and the bathroom is cramped but fixable by removing a wall. Otherwise, the room was very nice, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet. It is a 10 minute walk from the train that serves the airport ($2.50 each way), and a short walk to almost anything you want in downtown Seattle. The positives: as a Gold member, I received free internet and free breakfast coupons for each day. I learned on my last day that the coupons can be applied to any meal, at a value of about $13 - something to keep in mind as I visit other Hiltons. So, my Gold level status saved me about $25 each day! In addition, they serve a fairly extensive and free evening snack buffet at the top level restaurant, which occasionally served as dinner. This helped offset a glass of wine or two with my "dinner". Service was superb, by everyone at the hotel. All staff were excellent, from the housekeeper who serviced my room in 15 minutes when I needed to get back early, to the restaurant servers, and the front desk. This is a very customer-oriented property. A little known trick for bad weather is that there is an indoor path to the convention center. The staff can provide instructions if you don't want to venture outside. The one negative surprise had to do with phone charges. I had planned to take a 4-hour telecon via the internet, but I had a problem with my computer. Since I wanted to use the hotel speakerphone, I looked for a rate card, but there was no rate information in the room. I called the front desk, but they also had no information. At their suggestion, I called their provider, Sprint, but got the usual automated menu system with little outlook for a live person. So, I direct dialed - BIG MISTAKE! After 45 minutes, I had accumulated a $172 bill - almost $4/minute -- you just can't find rates like that anymore for domestic long-distance. Usually, rates are under a $1/min. I was motivated to get my computer working and finished the call that way. Later, I got a call from the front desk apologizing for their lack of information, and they cut my charge in half. A nice offering, but still, these charges seem out of line. I am drafting a letter to the hotel manager - they need to post their rates and not put their employees in this awkward position. Overall, this was a very nice stay and I would return.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR92789046">Centrally located downtown this is a great choice when working in Seattle. Easy to figure out local transportation (airport train and city buses) make it inexpensive to get around the area. Hotel entrance was a little screwy as you have to take the elevator to the 12th floor lobby. Room was spacious and good downtown view. Will definately return given the opportunity.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR86112207">The two bedroom suite was very comfortable with a large living room, dinning room table, bar (with sink) and extra bathroom. The walls were decorated with nice art and the furnishings seemed modern and new. Our large party was very comfortable and the hotel was able to reserve all the regular rooms adjoining the suite for us. Great views and we appreciated the relatively affordable price. Perfect for a family traveling together. The hotel does not have an executive lounge but elite members are welcomed to a buffet style breakfast and h'orderves served in the penthouse restaurant area. The space is a bit awkward because it is a bar with adjoining conference room. The set up can be compared to a conference buffet in a hotel banquet space. But you are graced with awesome views of Seattle. While none of us used the gym it had very good equipment. Same as the Beverly Hilton.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR84282184">Checked in to a excutive 2 bed room, Upper floor facing with a City View. Hotel room was much smaller than a average hotel room, Bathroom was quite small, and agree with the reviews that if a wall was taken down, the bathroom could seem much larger with the sink and shower all in one room... Beds were comfortable, Windows did open. Flat screen TV. Wasn't much room for 2 suitcases, had to use one of the chairs as a luggage carrier. Location was great, HSBC bank right down the block, a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and Pikes Place market.. Safety not a problem. No pool from what I could see, but the shearton has a indoor pool. Only issue was the room was located directly below their top floor resturant, while most of the chairs in the resturant are on carpet, there are some on a tile/marble floor. And when folks shift around in their chairs and walk around, you can hear it in your hotel room. I felt like I was staying in a apartment building rather than a Hilton hotel. Constant banging and shifting of tables and chairs, trust me it got annoying after a while. Thank god it was only 2 nights here and then I moved on. --- Also the Toilet is similar to one in a bus station with a flush handle you would flush with the bottom of your shoe and not you're hands. Once again - this in a Hilton, I've never seen it in a east coast hilton - but I was suprised nonetheless.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR81342434">Based on reviews here at Trip Advisor, the Hilton at 6th and University was not my first choice when I looking for a hotel in downtown Seattle. My sister and I had booked a short 4-day Pacific Northwest cruise originating in Seattle, and wanted to use my free Hilton Honors room certificates for pre and post cruise overnight stays. When I went to make room reservations, I found out that the Hilton was about the only hotel in downtown Seattle where I could use the certificates and get a room with two beds. It all worked out for the best. The Hilton turned out to be comfortable and accommodating, and was within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Westlake Center, and the Transit Tunnel. The rooms were small, which Iâ€™ve found to be typical of downtown hotels in big cities, but clean and well stocked. A breakfast buffet (approx. $13) was served every morning on the top floor with a view of the bay. The front desk staff, bellmen, and concierge were very friendly and helpful. We had a few problems with the room we stayed in pre-cruise. The toilet had a small leak at the top near the handle where you flush, and the thermostat didnâ€™t seem to work. We had to turn the temperature down to 64 degrees before we could get the humidity out of the room. The 2 lampshades/light fixtures between the beds were askew and we couldnâ€™t get them to stay upright. The lamp near the window had a similar problem and was bent. I reported the problems when we checked out the next morning. I would have reported the toilet leak and the thermostat problem the night before, but I got in late after a 4-hour flight and just wanted to go to sleep. The room we received post-cruise had no problems whatsoever. If you fly to Seattle and want to stay at the Hilton, I recommend taking the Grey Line Downtown Airporter that runs about every 20 minutes and drops you off and picks you up at the front door of the hotel. A round trip ticket only cost $25, as compared to $32 each way for a taxi.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR79251126">Awkward is not a normal word to use in a hotel but this is a awkward hotel. We stayed at this Hilton right off I-5 in the heart in the heart of downtown Seattle for 2 nights. We were able to find the hotel easily but not the entrance because it wasn't clearly marked and we expected something more for a large, downtown hotel. We took the elevator to the lobby (on the 9th floor) and checked into room 2402 on the Executive level. We are Hilton Gold VIP's so we got a free upgrade plus free breakfast. We got to our room and found it generally small although clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the beds and had a great time in the Executive lounge upstairs. The staff was nice and so were the snacks they gave out. We went to the "Top of the Hilton Restaurant" on the top floor and had a nice breakfast with great views of Puget Sound. We did check-out early as we were expecting something more for our anniversary and moved to the Westin Downtown which was a very nice hotel. I probably would not stay here again, as I might try the Westin again or try the Arctic Club Doubletree hotel which is a little nicer, I think.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR77211357">Although we have stayed at a few Hilton Hotels over the years, this one was initially a little harder to find primarily because we were looking for a more grand front entrance. Instead, the entrance to the hotel is rather small because the first 8 floors are the parking garage. The lobby is on floor 9. Parking is somewhat pricey at $28 per day. The hotel staff was excellent in the welcome and explaining that all dinning was at the tope floor. Our guest room was suprisingly smaller than we thought for 2 queen beds. The bathroom was especially 'tight'. Yet overall the room was very clean and showed very little wear. Nice flat-screen tv with good decor throughout. We had the continental breakfast whcih was excellent. Available was the large sausage, scrambled eggs, muffins, juice, coffee, thcik slices of bacon and even slices of salmon. The view of the city from the restaurant was not bad either. In all, we have a peaceful stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR71296588">Nice hotel in a great location. You are within easy walking distance to all of the downtown attractions and on the same block as the theater. The rooms are nice with good appointments, and the maids were really nice. The Hilton Honors lounge was also outstanding. They served a full spread every evening and free breakfast each morning on the top floor. The hotel is a little pricey, but not out of line with the rest of downtown Seattle. The biggest problem is room size. It's fine for a couple, but don't even think about putting more than 2 people in one of these rooms. With two twin beds you can barely walk around, and the bath room is "cozy". Also, if you are taller than 5-9, you will be looking down at your shower head.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR69581311">Typical big city, downtown hotel: elegant exterior, good location but with Comfort Inn-style quality--certainly nothing special to justify the $200+ room rate. A few blocks from water and new light rail system. Rental car kiosk is the first thing you see when you enter the hotel--pretty awkward and tacky. Elevators are really strange and slow. Room was comfortable, but bathroom way too small. The desk staff appeared to be overwhelmed, inexperienced, confused at times. Hidden--i.e., not advertised--$30/day parking fee. Warning: Room service is a COMPLETE rip-off!! They tack on a ridiculously high "delivery charge" IN ADDITION to the food price, tax, and tip you already expect to pay for a meal. I ended up having to pay something like $30 for a small salad listed as about $8.00 on the menu. The poor schmuck who delivered the meal was so embarrassed by the ridiculously high tab, he even apologized to me (BTW, he also works as a cook in the hotel bar/restaurant downstairs). I guess I should have expected this in a hotel that charges $8 for a bag of peanuts and charges for use of the so-called business center computer. Warning #2: Hotel overlooks a plaza with a new bar/restaurant that plays loud outdoor music to late at night. Nice restaurant on top floor but its only open to the scruffy masses for breakfast, lunch. Breakfast resembled a cattle-call with people/kids racing for the buffet bar. Apparently, dinner use is reserved for "special guests/members," whatever that means (probably snobby rich people dumb enough to throw away their $$ to maintain their delusion of elitism).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR66101864">Clean, up to date, very comfortable room with a view. What more could one need? Close to the light rail/bus station, walk down the hill to Pike Place Market, around the corner from the 5th street theater. We really enjoyed our stay here. As an elite Hilton member, we were treated to the executive lounge. Excellent hors d'oerves. The breakfast buffet was just as fresh and plentiful. I would definitely recommend this downtown hotel. The management is doing it's job well. (Note: the lobby can only be reached by elevators. Do not panic when you enter and only see the bell captain desk and a rental car agency. All will be well!)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR64743733">We stayed here for one night last week. The hotel is in a great location - 10 mins walk to Pike Place Mkt and lots of shops, close to Space Needle and other attractions. The close proximity to everything downtown is the ONLY reason I would ever stay here again. Parking is $28 per night. If you rent a car, try to rent one from National or Alamo so you can return it here and avoid the horrendous parking fee. Our room on the 25th floor looked updated. We did have a partial water view. We decided on two double beds instead of one king bed because our daughter was staying with us for a few hours until her red-eye later that night. We're used to sleeping in queen beds at home so a double was tiny and uncomfortable. The bed was also very firm and the pillows were very mushy. The A/C by the window was loud but turning it off made the room stuffy. We did not get a good night's sleep in this room. Bathroom was clean but tiny, particularly the toilet/shower area. There were more than enough towels and everything felt fresh and clean. We noticed we were at the end of the hall next to the icemaker so we worried about the noise but surprisingly, we didn't hear anything. The elevators seemed efficient. We never had to wait more than a couple minutes. In this hotel, if you want to go up from the lobby, you have to insert your room key into a slot in the elevator or it won't go! I understand why this is done but it got a little annoying at times. Front desk was efficient and friendly and we were checked in very quickly. The concierge was also very helpful when I asked for suggestions and directions to a location. I also used the business center computers to print out a boarding pass. The lobby area was also nice with big comfortable couches and chairs. The fireplace was going when I sat down there to use their free wi-fi. We also had a late dinner at the lobby bar lounge. The burgers are great and the atmosphere is relaxed and unrushed. My husband feels this is the worst Hilton he's ever stayed in because the room was so uncomfortable for him to sleep in but he's spent a lot of nights in quite a few of them and had better sleep. I would still recommend this place only for the great location but I'm not sure I'd stay here again. With all the great hotels in downtown Seattle, I'm sure we could find one with more comfortable rooms.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR61039849">I stayed at the Hilton Seattle in one or two week increments from April 2009 through March 2010. (I did make it home for a few weeks including the major holidays!) I enjoyed my time there greatly. Excellent service - many of the staff learned my name fairly early on. Outstanding Executive Lounge - food, staff, and happy hour. Excellent fitness facility - 3 treadmills, bike, 2 other cardio, free weights, and several machines. Rooms were comfortable with great beds. Location allowed for easy walking anywhere in downtown. Parking was available at a monthly rate that was much reduced from what the total daily rate would be. All in all, it was the staff, lounge, gym, and location (in that order) that I liked the best. I only had one minor issue my entire time there that was handled very well. (Had a water leak in my room in the middle of the night. I called the front desk, got dressed in my workput clothes and headed to the the gym as it was open 24 hours. The staff visited me in the gym a few times to provide status and had the room ready for me to get ready for work by the time I was done with my workout. I changed rooms after work that day. Entire matter handled very well!)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR58718223">Older hotel in great downtown location. Rooms are updated including the bathrooms and shower area. Beds, bedding, towels are all great. Room had flat screen TV and a window you could open. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Lobby and lobby bar are partially updated and as a result not the newest but not really old. Had salmon salad in the bar one evening for dinner and it was better than expected. Also a convenient location for printing boarding passes in the lobby. So with all this why an Average rating: The hotel is just a little dark and dated and common areas seem dingy. The conference hall for my meeting had really poor lighting and was also--well just dingy. Fitnees area has windows and was just okay. I was unfortunate enough to be stuck in an room with a common adjoining door with another room. I could hear every word spoken in the adjacent room. So MAKE SURE you do not get a room with a shared inner door. Unless you enjoy having someone else dictate when you are going to sleep. This happened late in my third night at hotel--too late to want to make a change as I had a 4:30am alarm.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR57439197">The hotel is convenient to the convention center through an underground walkway. The room corridor smelled musty, but the room was fine. Although the toilet-tub area was very small, the room itself was fine with all the usual amenities. The robes were an unexpected touch for a hotel at this price point. My biggest complaint would be the lack of lighting-especially in the entry and closet area. Also, the hot water tended to fluctuate. Service staff were very friendly and professional. I recommend the food in the lobby-tasty and reasonably priced.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR53771765">I was there for about 3 days for business. The room was what you'd expect from a Hilton; clean, comfortable bed and room, nice decor, a good place for a business trip. The only comment I'd really make about it was that it was hard to find a more casual, less expensive place to dine in the evening when we got back. Though my colleague had rented a car, we really didn't feel like driving around struggling to find the places listed for us and parking once we found them, and the list itself was out of date - three or four places we tried to walk to from it were out of business or closed for the evening. So be prepared to either take a taxi, or eat at the hotel. One nice option we hadn't realized they had - in the the upstairs lobby, they were serving drinks and you could order from the restaurant menu, which included appetizers that were quite reasonable for an actual light meal and quite tasty, too. The restaurant itself had a very nice view - I had breakfast there the third day and it was very good, and not too expensive by hotel breakfast standards.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR52804019">Stayed for 3 nights for the Thanksgiving weekend. We made the reservation on the hotel website and got $104/night with AAA discount. Since weâ€™re HH gold member, we got free breakfast in the executive lounge on the top floor. The hotel is not as â€œgrandâ€� as the other Hilton because the hotel lobby is on the 10th floor. When we pull up the hotel address, we didnâ€™t know it was the hotel since there is no obvious hotel entrance. There are 2 small doors on the 1st floor and a bellman is there most of the time. There is also a Alamo/National rental car counter on the 1st floor. You can only park on the street for 10 minutes for loading/unloading. We had to take the elevator to the 10th floor lobby for check in. Our room is on the 20th floor with partial water view. We can see the Red Lion, Sheraton hotels from our room. The room is small but adequate. Itâ€™s been renovated so the bathroom has nice granite countertop. Everything looks new and clean. The heater is noisy so we turn it off at night. The bed is comfortable, the sheets and towels are luxurious. Breakfast on the top floor was good, with a view of the city skyline. We can see the Space Needle from the breakfast room. Staffs are very friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel is at a great location, with luxurious stores on the 1st floor on the same block. Itâ€™s only a short walk to the downtown transit tunnel where you can take the bus or light rail to/from airport. Itâ€™s also a 10 minutes walk one direction to Pike Place or the other direction to the shopping meca with Macyâ€™s, Nordstrom, Westlake mall, etc. This is also where you can take the monorail to the Space Needle. But we walked from the hotel to the Space Needle via the Olympia Sculpture Park. We also walked to the ferry terminal to take the ferry to Bredenton ($7 round trip), a cheap way to cruise the Puget Sound. This hotel is definitely worth it.<topic>none</topic>

The Hilton Seattle Hotel appears to be a bit substandard. First the entrance lobby is very ugly. Second the breakfast dining area on the top floor is gray brown and the breakfast is something like a Hampton Inn. The rooms are very nice. The common areas are the problem confined and gray- brown.

<comment category="positive" id="UR47636835">This hotel was booked for me when I took my trip to Seattle and I didn't have a hand in choosing it so I was a bit apprehensive about what I was going to end up but it turned out to be just fine. Location was excellent, hotel was in walking distance to many places downtown as well as the monorail to the Space Needle and many bus lines if you're venturing to other neighborhoods. It's also in the 'ride free' zone which means if you're just staying in the downtown area between 6am-7pm, your bus rides are free. I'm sure there are many airport shuttles that can take you here too but if you're on a budget and just have a carry on, you can take regular public transportation buses as well. Room and bathroom were a bit small but not unbearably so. Decor wasn't bad but not super modern either, could use a facelift in the near future. Everything was clean and air conditioning worked well (which was a necessity because I ended up there at the beginning of the 100+ degree heatwave!) Staff was very pleasant and helpful - when I checked in, the woman at the desk complimented my shirt. Another time I walked outside the hotel and stood there for a few moments with a map in my hand trying to figure out which way I needed to go and an employee from the desk actually came outside and asked me if I needed help with directions. I also had a problem with being double charged for my stay, which I wasn't aware of until I got home and saw it on my statement, but I called the hotel and left a message explaining the problem and within 15 minutes I received a call back apologizing for what happened and the double charge had been refunded. I wish all customer service could be that quick and efficient!<topic>none</topic>

I hestitated to choose the Hilton after reading the reviews on this site, but our experience was so good that it has prompted me to write a review for the first time. The staff could not have been more helpful, starting with the warm greeting at the reception desk. We were both upgraded to executive floors, and found the rooms to be clean, ample and comfortable. The full complimentary breakfast was one of the best I have found in any U.S. hotel: a full buffet, with the option to order an omelet as well, and the serving staff was efficient, friendly and helpful.

<comment category="negative" id="UR46638065">The winning point for the Hilton is its location! You can walk to Pikes Market or get a busâ€¦.. Walk to get the monorail in the direction of Macyâ€™s. You can also walk over to the Sheraton( beautiful hotel) and book a Grayline tour or check with the concierge on the Lobby level.. Shopping is close by. From the airport you can get to the Hilton Hotel using the Airporter which can be picked up at the end of baggage, This bus stops and picks up at the Hilton Hotel round trip is $18.00 per person. A few negativesâ€¦the hotel rooms are small. The bathroom is too small. I did not like the toilet in with the shower behind a closed door. The lighting in the bathroom is to dim.( I know conservation). The walls are a bit thin. The TV seemed to be programmed not to go too loud. For a Hilton Rooms are bland and dull! Breakfast on the Top floor is average and over-priced. You can get a quick meal at Fergieâ€™s next door. On a bright side, the room was clean with large flat screen TV, it is clear the rooms have been graded a bit, bed comfortable the staff friendly and helpful. This is Business Hotel with little character. Car Rental Desk located in the hotel great for renting car for a day and return. Toursâ€¦I would recommend the Duck Tour for children and adults, it is just simply fun! Cost $25.00 per person but must pick up at the Space Needle.( take the Monorail cost $2.00 per person with Senior and Children discounts) Pikes Market is fun and interesting.( there is Pikes Market Tour) We did not take , but wondered around on our own. Boeing Tour is great for learning about how planes are put together. Everert(Boeing Factory) is located about 30 miles outside of Seattle. Tours are between $48- $56 depending on Tour Company. If you have a car you can drive but know that to park a car in a Seattle downtown hotel is very costly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR44313806">I stayed here 3 nights in September while attending a conference at the Convention Center. Supposedly the taxi fare is $32 from the airport (as adverstised on the cab window), but none of my colleagues or I got that rate. Something about extra taxes due to the airport. Our fares all ranged from $38-45. The bellman at the Hilton were all very welcoming and friendly and the front desk was nice enough. I checked in at noon, well ahead of the 3pm check in time. The room was clean and fairly up-to-date. The downside was that the bathroom was very tiny. It was quite awkward getting in and out of the bathroom to close the door. Also, the hangers for the closet had the tiny hooks so they couldn't be used on a normal clothes rod in order to help combat theft. As a result of this, you couldn't hang your clothes just anywhere. The only place besides the closet was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door. This became quite annoying very quickly when getting ready. On my last night there, it was after 10 pm at night and I heard the sink make a funny gurgling noise. When I looked in there, it was full of brownish black water. I called the front desk and someone came up and had it fixed within half an hour. I don't know if this was an ongoing problem as my neighbor had the same problem that night, but the response was quick and was taken care of quickly. The location of this hotel can't be beat. We were two blocks away from the convention center, and about 5-6 blocks from Pike's Street Market. I walked down there 3 times during my stay. The walk down is all downhill, and the walk back can be quite a challenge depending on which way you come back. If you walk down University street (which the Hilton sits on), it will take you straight to Pier 57 where you'll find many restaurants. We ate at the Crab Pot one night where they have a crab boil and dump all the goods on the table for you to break open with a mallet. Coming back up the stairs and hill after a full dinner was a real challenge! But fun nonetheless! Overall, this was a decent stay at a decent hotel. Not the best...but not the worst. The location of the Hilton and walking around the city made this a memorable visit!<topic>none</topic>

I can now honestly say I do not intend to stay here again. In a nutshell, the level of service here stinks...badly. Here's a rundown of failings of this place (as experienced by us on the last trip) - Lineup of no less than 5 parties at checkin - with one person manning the counter - despite this being at a busy time ~3pm, and with no apology for the wait. - Very snarly front desk staff. Upon informing him that we had 2 reservations (for consecutive nights...one with points, the other at a pre-paid rate) he reacted with serious attitude, as if I was inconveniencing him and that it was MY fault the reservations weren't "joined together" in the system. He then informed me that our room key "probably" wouldn't work on the second day of our stay - which, as it turned out, it didn't. (My opinion - this is a 'technical' issue that front desk should be able to deal with very easily, without me having to be inconvenienced by returning to the front desk to obtain a new key) - In previous stays using Hilton points I was offered comp. upgrade to 'executive' floor - not this time (despite the hotel clearly not being full). - Cleanliness of room was NOT up to standard - hair in bathtub and bathroom floor, for example. - Unusual (and cramped) layout of bathroom. - Lobby bar staff were unattentive, despite there being only 3 other people in it at the time. Furthermore, we had to listen to her complaining loudly to another patron about how long she had been on duty. Food was dropped on our table with nary a word. - Finally, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the fire alarm going off at 7:15 Subday morning, and continuing for ~30min (staff did instruct people via the PA system to remain in their rooms). Upon checkout later that morning I inquired as to the problem, with no real answer, other than "something went wrong" (duh!) - nor any apology whatsoever, nor any inquiry about whether our stay was satisfactory, etc. My (and I assume MOST people's) typical guage on the level of service at a hotel is the willingness of staff to take care of the small things that might otherwise cause you irritation or inconvenience, staff's expression of appreciation for your patronage and their general level of courtesy and pleasantness. From my experience, the Hilton Seattle is seriously lacking in those respects. Next time we will probably choose the Sheraton - its one block away and was a much more pleasant place the previous time we stayed there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR37770098">An interesting hotel, the lobby is on the 13th floor, the bottom 12 floors being a car park / offices. The rooms were the smallest I have ever been in in USA, I was in an executive room on 27th floor, like a shoebox and very noisy with traffic from I5 almost outside the room window. Surly staff overall, didn't have a "can do" attitude, worst of all I was hit with a credit card charge when I returned home for services I didn't use. I was not impressed. There are much better options than the Hilton Seattle, only go here as a last resort<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR36585615">This hotel was booked with my husband in mind as he leaves for Iraq in a few weeks. It was suppose to be a time to relax, sleep in and spoil ourselves. Instead we got woken up at 5:15AM to a fire alarm going off. Had to be evacuated for 2 hours into the street and it was cold. NOT ONE of the staff from the HIlton asked if they could make it up to us in some form or even apologize for the inconvience after the event. Then on the morning we were suppose to check out- NOT UNTIL NOON the housekeeping kept knocking on our door every 30 MINS starting at 9:00 AM to see if we had left yet so they could clean the room. We finally just left at 11:00 after not getting to sleep in once and exhausted. We were very disappointed with the Hilton and won't be wasting our money on this hotel again. It was very expensive and not worth the cost.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35318198">Our room was on a floor that was just remodeled and everything was clean and in working order. The room was a typical size for two queen beds; the linens were fluffy and new, the lotions and soaps were from a well known bath shop and were very special, the view of the city and Elliot Bay were fantastic. We also had had a fridge and coffee maker. Yes, you did have to pay for parking in the hotel, but that is to be expected when you're downtown. I did not have any issues with the staff, they were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us with a late check in.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR33974455">We stayed several days at the Seattle Hilton. I like to start with the good things. We had a nice, very clean room and ours had a decent view (see picture). We stayed on the executive/club level and having been in a lot of Hilton's, this one has one of the best club lounges in the business. The lounge is on the top floor and in the morning doubles as a breakfast restaurant. It's views are outstanding, the evening bar service is great and it also has free wifi for your laptop. All of the staff I encountered were great and helpful. Now the weak points. It's downtown location is great for conventioners but a bit of walking for the tourist crowd. Also if you drive in with you own car you have to park in their garage, no valet parking, and the garage is more expensive than most valet lots you'd run into. Also you either have to check in, and then ask for a bellman to come back to the garage with you, or haul all your own luggage in yourself. We had a fair amount so I went and got a bellman who was very courtous and helpful, but it did mean a fairly long time between arriving and being settled in the room. Still, considering everything including the staff I would choose this hotel on a return trip to Seattle. Unless someone else was paying, then I'd try the Four Seasons which is just a couple blocks away and looked great.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33954785">We liked the location as we had a car ($28 a night for parking) as it was only one block from the freeway so we didn't have to negotiate many streets. However, we found all the staff from the reception staff, bar staff to the exec lounge staff had a superior attitude to tourists especially. We booked an executive room &amp; had to return to check in to make sure it was actualy an executive room as it was so small, also very noisy right beside the lifts. After one night we asked to be moved &amp; got a much nicer room. The Executive lounge was really just the restaurant. After it closed at 2pm it then became the lounge.There was no complimentary breakfast for Exec room guests, so we considered the rate poor value for money. The website cleverly does not make it clear what the executive lounge provides.. I wouldn't go back - there were lots of hotels around the same area - will research better next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR32263978">My wife and I stayed at this Hilton for one night in January 2009. The location is fine, however the hotel is somewhat average. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It seems like it is in that 30-50 year old range where it's not yet a classic old hotel, but it is too old to be remolded or updated for contemporary style. The staff was very nice and the lobby was pretty cool, but as with all older hotels all of the money is in the lobby and the rooms are small and uninspiring. The diamond room is the combination of two old hotel rooms and is average. The staff was very helpful, but the facility itself felt cold. My wife described it as a state office building- like it was full of people without souls. The hotel was a good value. I think we only paid $105/night- however parking was $20/night. If you're just passing through and aren't interested in a great hotel, this Hilton will do. However if you are looking for a warm venue, I would try the Homewood Suites up the hill.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR31243165">I stayed in the downtown Hilton Seattle for 2 nights. My room was on the 16th floor. It was clean but could use some updating. There was a coffee-pot and keyed mini bar. There was no hair dryer and the bathroom lighting was poor. There was quite a bit of street noise.They do charge for parking.The bed and pillows were really comfortable The location is good(about 5 blocks to Pike Market). There are a number of places to eat within walking distance.The on ramp to I-5 is just around the block I used hilton miles for this visit,but i don't really feel this is 5* property.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR24692555">This hotel is conveniently located in the central downtown area. The city is very walkable, making the location of this hotel ideal. The staff was pleasant and always willing to make a recommendation or provide directions. Everything cost extra including parking ($28/day), internet ($10/day), and water ($4.50/bottle), but I suspect that is typical of the downtown hotels. I really enjoyed the breakfast wrap on the room service menu and the restaurant had great food as well.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR22492464">Stayed here two nights while attending a conference at the Hyatt, a few blocks away. No problems walking back and forth. Very friendly staff, including in the concierge lounge - able to provide great dining recommendations for all types of cuisine. The lounge is rather small, but good choices in the evening (not open for breakfast). The room was average size, but clean, including the bathroom. The only problem was that the Internet (hard wired only) did not work in my room. I had to host a Webinar that morning, so they immediately sent a maintenance person (after troubleshooting efforts on my part) who verified that it was not working. They moved me to another room in time for my Webinar and sent me a fruit/snack basket with apologies (and didn't charge for the Internet). They really took care of the problem the best ways possible! There is free wireless Internet in the lobby, along with a pay per use business center. The hotel is on the periphery of downtown, but is accessible, especially with the free downtown transit zone. If you are determined to stay at a Hilton, you should like this place. I also recommend you consider the Homewood Suites - Convention Center/Pike Street (see separate review).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR21154885">This hotel was in a convenient location in downtown Seattle, but I wasn't a fan of the set-up. I know there's not much to be done about it now, but I don't think I would choose this property again- especially for the price. First of all, you enter a rather empty area on the ground level. There was nowhere for the taxi to pull into and no awning to keep rain off. There was no doorman. Just a door at the corner of the building. You have to get on the elevators to get to the lobby and that really wasn't marked well. There's a ramp that leads to parking and a cardio center, but I don't know if I would have even noticed the elevators right away if somebody hadn't gotten off of one of them. The lobby is about 14 stories up over the parking area (I'm guessing at the amount of floors). Reception was efficient if not overly friendly. I know this sounds corny, but I kind of like the "oh you're a Diamond member, welcome back" spiel that I get at other Hilton properties. They did not even acknowledge that I had even stayed at a Hilton before. I really don't think they could have cared less that I was a paying guest at the time. My room was on a mid level floor and the hallway felt very cramped to me. The fixtures were older and the room itself was very, very tiny. I've actually had bigger rooms in prime areas in New York City. I ate in the restaurant at the top of the hotel. The dirty martini was excellent. The prime rib was not so great. The employee in reception did ask me if I wanted the key to the mini bar when I checked in, but forgot to give it to me. When I went back to the front desk to retrieve it, the response was "oh-here". I looked around for area information in the lobby and nobody offered any assistance. It just seemed like the employees did not like working there at all. Then again, it was a Saturday night and they were at work. My main concern was the small room size- even the bathroom was super tiny. If you have more than one person traveling and need a little space you may want to look elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20065921">The Hilton Seattle is located a block away from the Sheraton where all the action downtown begins - by action, I mean, shops and restaurants and everything else. This location puts its guests close enough to everything yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of a busy pedestrian area. Granted it is an older property, much older from the outside when compared to other hotels, such as the Sheraton but the rooms and the service provided is sufficient enough to make up for the age. Rooms have been renovated and while it is nothing too out of the ordinary, it is comfortable (albeit, the rooms, and especially the bathrooms are pretty small). Being another Hilton, one can come to expect reliability! The Downtown Airporter bus stops at this hotel (they only stop at a few select hotels) so that's another added bonus - there is no need to transfer to another bus to get to your hotel! All in all, a solid choice in Seattle.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19320703">Stayed at the Seattle Hilton for one night. We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and were not dissappointed. We parked in the Hilton garage and took the elevator to the 14th floor (lobby) to check in. The area was very nice with an attractive lobby bar. After a short wait (2 min. or less) we were greeted in a friendly manner and checked into our room without incident. I had pre-ordered some amenities to be in our room (flowers etc.) and when we got to our room they were there as requested. The room was on the Executive level (28th floor) and had a nice view of Elliott Bay (looking toward the northwest). The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. As some prior reviewers mentioned the room itself was small but not uncomfortable. We had no complaints. As others have mentioned the executive lounge was very small but the view was nice and the attendant was very friendly. This was the only below average experience we had. All staff were very accommodating and the location of the hotel was convenient to shopping and Pikes Place market (a walk of about 1/4 mile). All-in-all we would stay here again when in Seattle. Don't believe the negative reviews. The Seattle Hilton is a nice hotel in a very good location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18043256">We arrive late at night, to find hotel had been oversold and they didn't have a room for us (despite guaranteed late arrival with credit card). They tried to put us in nearby hotels -- but none were available. So after screwing around for about an hour, they put us in a function room with fold-out bed. They assured me the next day they would move our luggage to a bedroom. But when we came back after a day of enjoying the city, and went to front desk as instructed, the clerk had no idea where our room or luggage had been located. After calling around and banging on the computer for awhile, they found a room -- and had the bellhop find our luggage and move it there. But when we got there, room was not available, so they put us in yet a third room. Screw-ups, screw-ups, screw-ups. When all finally settled, the room was extremely small. I stay in New York city regularly, and this room was even small compared to New York rooms. There were several other screw-ups during our stay. A bellhop told me he was trying hard to find a job at another hotel in town that is better run. This hotel needs better management.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR16513729">We stayed at the downtown Hilton recently for four nights for a conference. I was apprehensive about the stay given negative reviews from other travellers. We had a very positive experience during our stay - although we did not use either the exercise facility or the business features. As per another's suggestion we requested an upper floor room with a view of Puget Sound. This was quite pleasant. The room was clean and quiet, although a little on the small side. The bathroom amenities were quite nice. We ordered room service during the stay, and the food was excellent and arrived as ordered. Additonally, the lobby bar was pleasant and understated. I'm not sure this hotel would be a good value at full rate, but discounted for the conference it served quite nicely.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15333050">I'm trying to keep my review within guidelines, because I feel it's important for people to know the kinds of business practices we ran into. We stayed at the Hilton for two nights, on the second night we were having our wedding reception at the top of the Hilton. All the booking went smoothly, the room was decent (exectutive sweet) and not overpriced, since we got a discount for having our reception there. The problems arrived later during our reception, and here is a short summary of things that happened. -Elevators were having issues off and on throughout the night. -Myself and several others from the reception were stuck in the lobby, and couldn't get back up to the reception due to elevators not working, and the key card we were given not working to go back up -The DJ closing the party early since only a few were at the party (no one could get back up) -Hilton Staff locking up the room, and not allowing us entrance to gather our belongs, or use the reception room for the additional hour and a half is was booked for by contract -A Hilton staff member challenging me to a fist fight, telling me to hit him, after I got aggravated and insisted he let us back up. -Having the head of security apologize for the actions of said staff member. -Finally getting back to the executive suite at least, to stay the rest of the night. -Having the police show up, because my wife assaulted the Hilton staff member who tried to fight me, be putting a hand on him and getting between the two of us, even after security had apologized to us. -After the police left, from hearing our story, an hour later (so long because the elevators were broken again) the night manager and security officer showed up to kick us out, for above mentioned assault, and we should be glad an arrest wasn't made. -After threatening to get lawyers involved for the breach of contract, being told we can stay. -Getting a call 15 minutes later from the night manager to apologize to me, and being told that we would work out some sort of discount for our trouble. -Waking up in the morning finding that we were double charged for the room, and parking for vehicles that were not ours. -Dealing with people that were at first nice, saying they would work on getting charges reversed and would call us right back. -Finding out that the Hilton made additional charges not outlined in the contract without consent -Being told that they're only willing to reverse a small portion of the charges, because the staff there says our story is false. So in the end, they breached our contract, and refused to credit us back for it. Not sure if we'll take any further action because we're already burned out from the abuse we received.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR15083315">This is the absolute worst Hilton that I have ever stayed in. We are Gold HH members, travel a lot, and this is the absolute worst Hilton in the world. We were on the last leg of a two week vacation with our 10 year old daughter that took us to Hilton properties in South Lake Tahoe CA all the way to Whistler BC. I would rate the other Hiltons as "Excellent" First of all they charge you $9.95 a night to use the internet in your room. The free wireless internet is only available in the Executive Lounge (small converted guest room) or in the lobby. We went up to the Executive Lounge and it was comical. There were business people packed elbow to elbow on their laptops using the "free" internet eating and drinking their "free" food. What a sight! I'm sure that they could de-congest the Executive Lounge if they didn't charge for the internet! We stayed on a Hilton Honors floor, but noticed that dirty dishes and newspapers in the hall weren't picked up for the three days that we were there. The excercise room is about the size of a walk in closet and they have two treadmills and a stepper jammed in there. The only people who provided any sort of customer service were the Bellmen. Front desk personnel and management that I delt with have no customer service skills. My car was parked in the Hilton garage and my window was smashed out and my car was ransacked. Hilton Security simply left a business card on my smashed window and took the time to sweep the glass off of the ground. I discovered that Hilton Security knew that my car was broken into and let it sit there with a smashed out window for over two days! Did they notify me? NO! After a series of failures by Hilton staff I was put in touch with Seattle Hilton's Director of Security. I asked him why I wasn't notified that my car had been broken into. His response "It is not our policy" and "it's not in the parking manual". Hilton Honors stated that the GM would contact me on Monday. Well here it is Wednesday and no response. I finally drafted a lenghty letter to Hilton Corporate HQ regarding the Seattle Hilton.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR14970268">Stayed here April 7 - 11. Attended a conference held in the hotel. This property is in a great location in downtown Seattle, in easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Pacific Place shopping, the Convention Center, and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is an older property, but the only way to guess that is due to the slightly smaller bedroom and bathroom sizes, along with the narrow corridors on the floor levels, along with the small number of rooms on each floor. All walls, tiles, linens and furnishings were clean and modern, presenting a nice decor. Bathrooms were equipped with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Le Source toiletries (my favorite!). Rooms start on floor 14 (which I was on) and run through floor 28, with the restaurant on the 29th floor. Three elevators provided smooth and speedy service. Another plus - to access any guest floor, and room key was required, helping make a single traveler feel safe. The meeting rooms were spacious and the hotel staff kept refreshments aplenty. Breakfast and lunch each day in the restaurant was an unexpected gourmet treat - much more elegant than normally required for informal meals. The restaurant had a spectacular view of Puget Sound and when the sky was clear, the Olympic Mountains. The view was easily seen from any seating area. The bar area also had a menu but I didn't eat there - but the bar was large with a cozy decor. The concierge was friendly and helpful. One night she made a reservation for me at Cutter's Restaurant, making sure the restaurant would provide me complimentary transportation for my return to the hotel. At the restaurant, I was given an appetizer, courtesy of the concierge. Also, I needed a 4:15am town car pick up for the airport my last day and the concierge booked me with a company, saving me $15 off the most affordable transportation I found on my own on the internet. My only disappointment was the business center - very small and a $6 fee for use. Most hotels now offer this as a complimentary service. Maybe the Seattle Hilton will change this soon. Thanks for a great four nights, I slept very well!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR12715369">I stayed here for 1 night and am HH Gold. Not sure why people complain about check-in not being ground level as there are many examples of international hotels with a similar configuration. IMO, not something to really gripe about. I actually welcome it as it means the floors start at a higher level thus further removing you from street noise. Upon walking to the ground floor entrance, the bellman was extremely pleasant and asked if it was my first time. While waiting for the elevator, he carefully explained the hotel amenities and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I was a little early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. I left my bags with the concierge and went looking for lunch. Upon returning, my room was ready and was given a room on the 25th floor. I noticed they called this floor the HH floor. The room itself was a decent size. The furniture is newish and there is a flat screen tv, although I consider this "de rigeur" for the HIlton chain. I did think the comforter was a little on the thin side, but did the job. There is an in-room safe and an electric thermostat. Some of the hangers looked a little derelict but did the job. The washroom sink is separated from the toilet and bath. Both areas are quite small. One thing I did note is that the shower had excellent water pressure. As a HH Gold, I was allowed access to the 28th floor executive lounge and received a coupon for a free buffet breakfast on the top floor restaurant. There were some passes to places such as Gold's gym but I can't remember the other ones. The lounge had h'ors d'oeurves from 5-7 pm. I walked in and noted there was a single hot steamer (didn't look inside) with a decent selection of veggies. I think there was an alcohol selection. Didn't stay as I had other dinner plans. Next morning, went to the top floor restaurant for breakfast. The buffet was not the most plentiful I've seen but decently stocked. There were the standard bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast, pastries, fruit, etc. A feature I like about all Hiltons is that you can ask for made-to-order eggs as part of the buffet. I ordered an omelette and what came back was a HUGE omelette that was very good. I've had omelettes in plenty of hotels before and can vouch that this thing was big. Check-out was smooth. The whole time during my stay, there were reminders that "I would be getting a survey and if I couldn't rate the hotel a 10, they encouraged me to call someone about it". Considering the Hilton is NOT a 5 star hotel (I think 4 star), it met expectations. The staff certainly did try and tried hard. I would stay here again, provided the price is right. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (but TripAdvisor won't allow that) because the HVAC was a little loud and the smallish bathroom size. The staff service is definitely 5 star.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11214708">Recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. No major complaints. The set up is a little odd what with having to take an elevator to the lobby from street level but nothing to stress over. Check in was smooth. We were given a room on the 23rd floor. It was just right the right size for myself and my boyfriend. Apparently this hotel has been recently renovated. It shows. The furniture in our room was in pristine condition and the widescreen LG tv's are great. The beds and bedding are also top notch. The one complaint I would have about the room would be that the bathroom area is on the small side. It is definately a one person sized area. You have to take turns getting ready. Also something that might be and issue for light sleepers who plan on sleeping in is that the hotel walls are on the thin side. Sound travels here. We woke early on both mornings to go out and could hear housekeeping knocking on doors loud and clear. I thought they were knocking on the door of the room next to ours but when I peeked out they were at least 5 doors down. We were given access to the concierge lounge on the 28th floor. It is a converted guest room and as such is not particularly spacious. The gentleman up there serving drinks is great for any kind of questions you may have about where to dine, what to see, etc. He recommended a fantastic restaurant to us and made us reservations as well. I can honestly say it was one of my top five dining experiences ever. I did not dine in the hotel restaurant or use the fitness room so I have no comment on those areas. There is a lobby bar which is fairly spacious but I never saw more than 5 guests in there at once. Not a super busy place. One final comment I would like to throw in about this hotel is that the staff we came across were all pleasant. I find this to be one of the things I judge an experience by the most. Its kind of like going to a restaurant and having wonderful food and horrid service. The food could be the best ever and you probably wouldn't go back because the service sucked. All of the service personnel we came across were friendly and courteous. Particularily the concierge in the concierge lounge. They made our stay most pleasant. I will definately be back to this hotel<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR11096098">I have just stayed in the Seattle Hilton for 4 nights and apart from a couple of minor issues I found it to be excellent. The concierge at the front desk was very helpful. Check in is on a different floor but there was no hassle going up there, and it was extremely fast. The rooms were very clean with large, comfortable beds and nice views, if not spectacular, and the flat screen tv is really excellent with a wide rage of channels. The bathroom is small and has a strange layout but overall it was ok. There is lots of storage space to put things. They serve a nice, and not completely overpriced, breakfast which also had fast service. I did not eat a main meal in the hotel but it is close to a lot of restaurants and two blocks away from the major shopping area. The only issue that I had with the hotel was the bathroom. The plug in the bath did not work making it impossible to take a bath if you wanted as the water just drained away.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR11073921">I've never stayed in such a small room before in my life and for the price you would think it would have been much larger. The bathroom amenities are nice, I just wished the bathroom would have been large enough for 2 people to stand in it at one time. The room is so small that 2 people can't walk between the beds and the tv at the same time. Did I mention the beds? For the price you pay you would think the beds would be much more comfortable, but they aren't! I just really don't have any positive reviews on the room, except nice bathroom amenties (if you like Crabtree and Evelyn). Even the towels weren' t that soft... Sure, the hotel is convenient to shopping and sure the bartender in the lobby (Bob) is one of the best by far, but to park in their garage you have to pay $26/night. I wasn't that impressed with the restaurant either, you will get much better drinks in the lobby bar (Bob is the bartender there). The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere. The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key. I had to go back down to get one and that was after a lady came by the room to check our mini bar. Did I mention that she "softly" knocked and then proceeded to walk in our room and we were not "prepared" for company at that moment! My husband was furious and wanted to tell the front desk about it, but I told him to just blow it off. For the money, I do NOT recommend this hotel. I think there must be much larger rooms in a hotel downtown somewhere and they surely must be nice rooms for that price. I know we will continue to search for that hotel and keep you informed when we find one.<topic>none</topic>

We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect. Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite. On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful. He put together a dinner at Salty's that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids. I would stay here again on points of for business, but if it was my own money I might look around before booking it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8615440">After reading the many negative reviews on this property, I was hesitant. How long could it take to check in? Only a minute--and they have an "atm" style check in machine. The service: outstanding. Ask for a room facing Puget Sound on a higher floor for a view that rivals the Space Needle. The new flat screen TV was nice. The room was spotless. In short, the only thing I could confirm from reading the reviews below was that indeed the carpeting in the outside hall was a bit dated.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8536851">Before we entered the lobby, we were greeted by several employees. Service was excellent. When issues arose, they were promptly and efficiently taken care of. Rooms were clean and well furnished. Concierge was very helpful. Very close to downtown attractions. Views only of other buildings, but not a problem. Restaurant at top good.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8508024">We stayed at the Hilton Seattle from August 18-20, 2007. What a beautiful, friendly, comfortable and well-located hotel. We were only a few short blocks from the Pike Street Market, harbor front restaurants and shops and even closer to the high-end shopping district (5th and 6th Avenues) with Nordstroms, Macys, Abercrombie and Fitch, Gap, etc. Our room was a King Non-Smoking. The room was larger than expected, well-furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The parking garage and elevator system were convenient and fast. I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgable of hotel ammenties and the city (what not to miss in 2 days!). We were directed toward the Brooklyn restaurant for our first dinner in the city -- good choice. The Top of the Hilton was wonderful for nightcaps and breakfast - great view. As HHonors members, we also had the Executive Lounge appetizers and drinks in the early evening. All was excellent, especially the EL concierge staff. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on my next trip.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR8110587">Yes there is some construction going on and one of the elevators was being rebuilt, but from arrival to check in and then to the room, no issues noted. Friendly employees were the norm. We visited the concierge bar upstairs and the lobby bar downstairs and had nothing but friendly, mostly efficient service. It DID take a bit for the four of us to get our bloody marys and mimosas with breakfast in the morning. I wouldn't worry about the negative comments keeping you from staying here; the hotel is centrally located, reasonably priced and is all in all a very comfortable place to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR7628563">I was placed on an Executive Floor (being a Gold member) and it had carpeting that was dirty. It looked like it had not been cleaned in months. The TV cabinet had a broken door and when I asked they stated it was broken for â€œover a week.â€� Called room service for food at 19:15 and no one answered - got a voice mail. What hotel leaves no one to respond to room service at that time of night? I got a call back 15 minutes later and placed an order. The meal arrived 20 minutes later and was very good. Given that DT Seattle is an overpriced hotel market, the Hilton is over priced. My suggestion is stay somewhere else.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6841999">The only good thing about this hotel is its location--easy walking to shopping and to the market. The hotel itself is overpriced for what you get, which is old furnishings, musty hallways, and a quite curt staff. Fortunately, after three rounds of correspondence, we received a half-stay refund as requested.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6269676">In order to maintain my Hilton HHonors status I stayed as many weeks as I could stand before I just became too fed up. The building is old and outdated, the parking garage is a pain, the workout room a joke, service is lacking, staff are unskilled in their jobs, and nobody really seems to care. For example parking seemed to be handled differently every time I checked in, with the result that nearly every time I left the garage I had to go through the process of explaining that I was staying at the hotel and wait for someone to figure out if I had paid for parking. Billing errors occurred more than once, including a charge that showed up a week after I checked out. The most galling however was the total disinterest in making a frequent customer happy â€“ the rooms I was given included some needing repair, some with spectacular views of a wall and puddles on a roof, two with barely functioning air conditioners, and a room designed for handicapped access that can best be described as barely functional â€“ and they never gave me a room on, or access to, the executive floor. There are many fine hotels in Seattle, and this isnâ€™t one of them.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR6110382">We recently stayed in the Hilton and as the name and reputation would suggest we treated ourselves. Unfortunately we should not have bothered, the foyer was very impressive and the staff friendly but the room was a real let down. I found the hotel overpriced and the accomodation was no better than your average $100 hotel, the bathroom needed replacing, the water came out yellow at first and really smelt! We left early in the morning as we had to catch a train to Vancouver B.C so did not have time to complain, but thought this would be a good way of letting people know not to stay here.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR5560273">There's really no reason to stay here, there are much better options in Seattle for the same price or less. I'm a hilton honors diamond member, so I was hoping for some sort of upgrade. The rooms are the same on every floor, so no benefits here. I was given some coupons to the bad breakfast buffet, but apparently everyone in the hotel had the same vouchers because the tiny room was packed and there were not enough tables. The decor in the rooms are very outdated. The bed was comfortable, but the shower and all other furnishings were not good. It was just a depressing room all around. It is in a good location. Hilton should just close it down and re-make the whole place, it could be a lot better. It is NOT worth the price they charge.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126462455">Check in was quick, easy and enjoyable as the front desk clerk was very amiable. The room was a little small but very clean and included a 1 cup coffee maker. The only minor complaints would be the Wi-Fi was somewhat slow and TV was the old tube style, not a flat panel. The location of the hotel is good as it's close to the Space Needle, downtown and public transportation. The free breakfast is great, as there is a large selection, including hot food (and waffles you can make fresh yourself) and it tasted good. I booked my room at Priceline and one of the freebies (I brought the printout and showed it desk clerk) was free parking so I didn't have to pay the $15 per night. Overall, a comfortable, pleasant experience at a reasonable price and I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR126355251">We stayed here one night in March. They were so so friendly and helpful. The room was updated, clean, and quiet. We had to check out early to make our connections but needed a quick bite to eat. The complimentary breakfast was a wonderful surprise. Usually these breakfasts contain mostly high carb items. The Quality Inn had scrambled eggs and bacon. They also had a tray of grilled onions and peppers to add to your eggs. The breakfast was a delicious treat!<topic>none</topic>

Only thing I was upset about is we were told during reservation making our room king suite with jacuzzi tub was on a upper floor so you can see the space needle. Well not so much. Got a great view of the rooms of the travelers lodge. Lol. Wasn't a huge deal. Still had a great time for our first time there.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR125479103">20 yrs. ago this place was a place you wouldn't let your dog stay overnight, we had checked in, went to our room and checked right out, it was that bad.....then. I was reluctant but they offered a wonderful medical discount (my brother had a day surgery) and they were nearby, they even waived the parking fee and had a free shuttle to all the destinations we wanted to go. As soon as I walked in the ambiance was like home, a great room so warm and friendly just like their staff. All the amenaties (hot tub and pool were delightful). The marble bathroom was an exceptional change, the bedding was classic comfort and the pillows were to die for, my bro. asked me if I could find him a few of those. They say they are still in renovation mode, I can't imagine it getting any better! The price with the discount was a huge plus as we had to travel so far to get there and back, even without a discount it's a killer deal, measures up to any 5 star hotel I've ever been in and they have even more luxurious suites than the simple Dbl. bed we chose, Those prices are the best I have seen in Seattle for such comfort, do check out the virtual tour, I had no idea they offered that online as I was in a hurry to find a place, last minute. I got home, clicked on the virtual tour and it is EXACTLY WHAT YOU VIEW on the tour, no phoney trick to get you there, you get what you see and much more. Don't pass this place by, you will miss out on a great experience. Nice job Cody and staff, you are now my and all my friends &amp;families go to place when we want or need to be in Seattle!! (we even had the space needle as our view OMG, breathtaking at night). The entire staff was amazing, really!!! You will never regret booking with this hotel, I assure you. I just learned, my cousin from California has booked with them the last 2 yrs. for a week at a time and she agrees with everything I have written, she's sorry she didn't do it herself. Looking forward to our next visit, thanks so much John St. Suites, it was a delightful time just hanging around.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR124975993">I liked this place a lot. The hotel seemed very nice and the staff were quite friendly. This hotel is great value for money when you consider the location and the facilities. The pool was very nice, if a bit crowded. The breakfast was excellent with hot/cold selection. Our room was a little small but nice. Overall, location was excellent. I think it would be hard to find a better location for the price paid. It was crowded over Presidents Day weekend but that speaks volumes about how affordable the hotel is. Shuttle service was good. Staff seemed quite nice. One returned my social security card after I dropped it which was very helpful. Overall, very nice stay in an excellent location!<topic>none</topic>

When we got there it was Jennifer at the front desk, what a wonderful person she is. She upgraded us to a suite, we were two adults and two kids. The room has two rooms, kitchen it was on the third room, what a beautiful service we received. Thank you thank you so much Jennifer, you are such a beautiful human being, outside and inside.

<comment category="negative" id="UR119458411">I used a booking.com site to reserve a room at this hotel for an event at the Seattle Center I was planning on attending. Quality Inn overbooked and first wanted to place me in a room far out of the way from the downtown area. Booking.com assisted to arrange a room closer to the event and Quality Inn was suppose to pay the difference of the late reservation to a hotel close to the Seattle Center. After the event I submitted the proper paperwork to Quality Inn for reimbursement. THe Hotel would not respond to multiple emails and phone calls. Booking.com has tried to assist but it has been six weeks since I submitted the paperwork to Quality Inn and they will not even return a phone call. Their service in this matter has been extremely unprofessional. Do not use a booking site with Quality Inn and Suites of Seattle. They can not be trusted.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119279667">We stayed at this hotel several nights while in Seattle. The hotel is convenient to downtown Seattle, located very close to the space needle and within walking distance to Pike's Market, however be ready for the steep hills on the way back. My advice is to take the city transit to help shorten the walk. The last day we were there our plans got changed and we had to rearrange some of our nights. John, the manager that morning was so nice to help us, he arranged for a rental car and gave us directions and comments on our desired plans. Jennifer was very professional and helpful also. She was nice enough to talk to choice privileges so I wouldn't lose my points. Thanks to both of you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR119223036">We stayed three evenings at the Quality Inn &amp; Suites - it is very close to the Space Needle - you can walk to the Needle within 10 minutes. And if you're really enthusiastic, you can walk to the Pike Place Market. Took the monorail to the bus and link train connections at Westlake Mall which made traveling around Seattle very easy. The only drawback was the hotel - the rooms are very small (especially two people who are staying three nights), but the hotel staff accommodated us by giving us a larger room. The breakfast was good - both hot and cold offerings.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR119159276">My husband and I were very pleased with our 3-night stay at this Quality Inn, Seattle Center. Couldn't have a better location for getting around Seattle. Also, we were able to walk to restaruants without any problems. Our room and the bathroom were small but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. And we had covered parking. Also, a guest laundry was valuable to us and not available in many motels. The price for Seattle accommodations fit our budget-minded travel requirements very well. Only problem was very poor internet connections. Called about the problem and was told that the hotel was not getting good service from their provider. A little annoying.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR118894703">Nothing fancy, and you may have to ask for a bigger room (they have adequate to "nicer" rooms) but for the location and great breakfast this was a great deal. We never had trouble getting a place to park, the room was always clean, coffee was always available in the lobby, and the breakfast was great. We ran the A/C to drown the traffic noise but even that was alright cause I liked the "white noise". The staff was always very nice and friendly. I had read a few poor reviews but took the chance anyway. I'm glad there is moderately priced, clean, adequate places like this to stay at, in a great central location when you want to vacation but are on a tight budget. This hotel completely met and exceeded our expectations. Keep going on the updating though!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118623865">Not one of the best places I have stayed in Seattle that is for sure. I would say its good if you get a fantastic rate otherwise I would look elsewhere. We checked in late and turns out we were given the wrong room, which was much smaller and not renovated as nicely. We understand that often happens with hotels when you check in late. Next day we asked and said we were being transfered to another room right away. Housekeeping was still in there just finishing making it up which was fine. We transfered our belongings and left for the day. When we returned at about 8pm we found that our new key cards would not work. We went to front desk to inquire and there was no front desk person. The office was locked, the side door was wide open. There were people waiting to check in. We hunted everywhere for someone. Finally someone arrived after about 10 minutes. This is unacceptable. Even if he had to step away for an emergency he should have left a note. Almost every time we needed to deal with front desk either they were short staff or no one was there. There was another occaision we were down in the lobby and the desk person was no where to be found. the first room itself was terrible and very stuffy. the second room was much better, decorated nicer and more represenatiative of what we had booked but the beds in both rooms were not very comfortable and the air very stuffy. the pros: the location, the price if you get a great rate, the cons: service, the rooms<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR118407572">We stayed here for 1 night prior to an Alaskan cruise. I'm satisfied with our choice because we got a decent rate. Granted the hotel is older and showing some wear, as does the room, but the room was good sized, clean and quiet, with a refrigerator. We faced the street, but didn't hear any noise at night. There didn't seem to be much traffic here at night. This area does have several other hotels, including a Holiday Inn across the street. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Space Needle, which we visited prior to the cruise. There didn't seem to be many restaurant choices in the immediate area; I believe there was an Italian one within a couple blocks, but not much else except a McDonald's. Didn't want to do too much walking at night, as the area was pretty deserted on a Friday night. The hotel breakfast is very good, with a lot of choices, even bacon. If the room is crowded, an adjoining conference room can be used, so space was not an issue. We took the hotel's $6pp shuttle to the cruise pier, which is about a mile away. This worked well as it was efficient and on time. This was a good reasonably priced chocie for a pre/post cruise stay.<topic>none</topic>

We asked the desk clerk to send someone up and they did, but we were told that the lock had to be replaced and they were not able to do that until the next day.

<comment category="positive" id="UR117905662">Quality Inn was, like many, in need of updating but was clean and comfortable. Bed comfortable and showers hot. Stayed 5 days, one more than planned. Original room was small, queen bed, but because of a water leak was moved to a king suite. Even the smaller room provided the comfy bed and hot shower! Staff were friendly, courteous, helpful and accommodating. Parking is an issue but they do have limited parking. Early arrival probably helps. We never got into our car after arrival. Great breakfasts provided also. Best part is location. 2 blocks from Space Needle, Music Experience and Monorail. Restuarants, bars in area. Monorail will get you downtown where you can easily walk to Pike's Market and Harbor area. You can also walk down Broad St., which is near, down to Harbor area. Tour buses also available near Space Needle. Beautiful area! Definitely would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117849766">I am an individual who chose this facility for my lengthy stay without any prior knowledge, knowing that I would be able to move to any number of highly recommended places at any time. I chose not tonfor a number of reasons. I was amazed bynthe quality of the staff at all levels. They were consisitently kind and professional, and for my specific need, compassionate. And although I tried to minimize my requests, the few that I had were met with concern, ambition and dedication. I got to know my new friends on a personal basis and there are far too many to mention here. Many staff went above and beyond in meeting my needs. Now for the location, the only word being ideal for so many things. Surrounding neighborhoods are safe and surprisingly artistic. Daily Walks, or in my case wheeling in a wheelchair, were very enjoyable. People need to be aware that while the shuttle is there for your convenience, it is also important to know that the drivers have cruise ship obligations amongst others, so it is necessary to always be prepared to take a cab. They can almost always accommodate you with at least a days notice. Rooms were exceptionally comfortable and if anything was lacking, it was only a friendly phone call away. I would have preferred an ice machine on every floor, but this was only because I was unable to use the stairs and had to wait for a sometimes busy elevator. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff...all of whom should be commended, maybe in the form of a raise :). Highly recommended!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR117234014">We stayed here before and after our cruise to Alaska. It was a great location. The hotel offers a free shuttle (you just pay the driver a tip) to take you around if it is available. We had them take us to Pike's Market and then to the Pier. They will also pick you up and drop you off at the airport for $10 per person. Taking you and picking you up from the cruise ship is $6 per person. What a bargain! The hotel room had a comfy king size bed and a huge handicapped bathroom. Supposedly Elvis stayed there and filmed some location shots at the pool. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the Space Needle and there are several restaurants by the Space Needle area. If you want to ride the Ducks around Seattle, that is even closer to the hotel. The hot tub was broken when we were there so I didn't bother to use the pool. The breakfast was lots of carbs - but pretty decent and a bit better than a lot of the free breakfasts offered. And if you are driving or have a rental car - FREE parking! That's huge in Seattle where most hotels, you have to pay to park. The staff was pretty nice and the drivers were great. We got there early and so we checked our luggage and went sightseeing. There is a computer with internet in the lobby also if you need to check in with your airlines, etc. They also have restaurant menus at the desk which was helpful when we were looking for someplace to dine. I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117056152">I read the reviews of this hotel carefully. I realized full well what type of lodging it was. I did not want to pay for a four star hotel in Seattle. Priceline rates were going for way more than I was willing to pay. I decided to give this place a try and I was not disappointed at all. We found the check in staff very friendly and efficienct, although they didn't seem that familiar with the area and couldn't answer several of our questions. Our room and bathroom were very basic, but VERY clean. The room did have a cleaning solution odor, which bothered me a little. I do have asthma and was worried it would be triggered by the smell. However, we ran the fan so it drew in outdoor air, and it turned out to be just fine. I also left a note for housekeeping to please not use any deodorizing sprays for day 2. The odor decreased significantly. Breakfast was typically 2-3 star hotel breakfast. Nothing to write home about, but adequate to start your day. We were most grateful for the free parking. We thought the location was perfect. We ate at several local restaurants that were frequented by the locals. It was not a far walk to downtown. We liked that it was much quieter around than the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again. However, as mentioned by another reviewer, you have high standards for your lodging and like 4 star hotels, this is probably not the place for you. If, however, you are just looking for a friendly hotel with a clean room and free parking, you will likely be satisfied.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR117006965">This hotel is located just two blocks from Seattle Center and the Space Needle. It is close to the Belltown area where there are tons on restaurants. The hotel fronts Aurora Ave which is a very busy divided highway (no turn arounds). The location is prime for just about anything you want to do in Seattle and the prices are uaually some of the best around. It has free internet and free parking (rare for downtown Seattle). The free breakfast is the standard fare with all the craziness attached. The hotel has lots of tourists and can be very busy, although the staff at the front counter are very friendly and check in is quick. The downside is the hotel itself is pretty old and while very clean is outdated. The styling is probably 80's at best and has a few rough spots. In short if you are looking for a great location and good price, and you will be using the hotel just to sleep, it is probably just fine. If you prefer a little nicer style of accomodations then this place is probably not for you.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116625410">I choose to stay at this hotel during a weekend conference in Seattle. Based on the previous reviews posted, I knew that this hotel was not going to be fancy. The location is great. There is a McDonald's nearby as well as Walgreens. It is also very close to the Space Needle. You need to walk about 20-30 min to get to the City Centre. The building is fairly old. The registration counter and first floor has probably been renovated but the rooms are not. The room was pretty small and it was mostly clean. Our toilet bowl had a layer of grime so it could definitely use a scrubbing. There were a decent number of hand and bath towels available to us. The biggest complaint was the air conditioning. It is extremely noisy. I had to wear ear plugs during the night. We had to leave the AC on because it was so stuffy. The decent was decent. There were scrambled eggs, sausages and waffles. I have been to several Quality Inns before and there were no sausages. The hallways do smell a bit and feels rather dingy. The big plus of this hotel is the free parking. If you pay 2x the amount, you can stay at a fancier hotel. I chose to cheap out and knew what I was getting. It is just a matter of managing your expectations.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR116279072">This hotel was terrible. My company booked this place because everything else was COMPLETELY sold out in Seattle. My room had an overwhelming smell of urine, stains in the carpet, the carpet was torn up in multiple places and the bathroom, beds and carpet were filthy. I immediately tried to find a way out, however, there were no hotel rooms anywhere in the city. After pleading, I was given the keys to 5 other rooms, and ultimately had to settle with the best of them. I would not recommend this place...EVER!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115778314">Stayed 1 night after attending the Man U vs Seattle Sounders soccer game. Based on the ranking on tripadvisor I was somewhat hesitant about the hotel. My concerns were luckily unfounded as the hotel was much better than I thought. Check in was fairly quick though they didn't tell us the time for breakfast or the password for wifi. Luckily I overheard this info from the previous people checking in. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the Monorail, EMP and Space Needle. There is free underground parking. I think we got a free upgrade as our room had a hot tub in it though it was missing the roll away I had requested. This was rectified by the time we came back from the game. Good selection of breakfast items including sausage. The dining room was full but they had a another room open for people to use. No problem connecting to the wifi at night but couldn't connect in the morning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR115655718">Location was perfect - could walk easily to Seattle Center &amp; Monorail/bus lines. Breakfast was great for teens - all you can eat &amp; a wide variety of food. Room was DIRTY. Dirty, wet washcloth hanging over the shower curtain, dust in the corners of the room &amp; windowsill was dirty. Beds were clean. Room had wallpaper missing &amp; had been patched (not well) with more wallpaper so it looked a bit odd. Baseboards were coming off the wall in parts of the room. Room 405. Had a hard time sleeping, noisy teens running through the hallways after midnight. Elevator by breakfast room looked like it was being repaired &amp; needed paint, but another guest mentioned it had been like that the last time he came. First desk staff person was AWESOME. We arrived early &amp; she gave a parking pass to keep the car there while we went sightseeing. When we came back to check in, the next gal was RUDE!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR115649579">We were easily able to check in with a cash deposit ($100) instead of a credit card and for $20 above the lowest rate we were offered we were booked into a jacuzzi suite. Their check in time is 3pm, earlier than most Seattle hotels. The in room jetted tubs at Quality Inn are far superior to the single person bath tubs with weak jets found in most hotels. It's basically like a small hot tub and it isn't in the bathroom, it's across from the bed. Ours had chocolates and roses on it when we walked in, but a man immediately showed up and took them as they were apparently not intended for our room. The continental breakfast is pretty decent, with the waffles you make yourself and various hot food options. The pool is large, very heavily chlorinated and insanely popular with small children. You also have to walk through it occasionally to get to the lobby, which is odd. They let us check out at 3pm and returned our entire deposit... they even held our luggage for a few hours with no issues. Overall, excellent value and by far the best jacuzzi tubs in the city. They also have this huge suite that takes up a whole floor, is pretty reasonably priced and great for parties. The neighborhood is not one where you want to walk around too much, but it's okay once you're a few blocks away.<topic>none</topic>

The room and bathroom were exactly what one would expect from an older, classic hotel: 2 beds, little storage, and small bathroom. Everything was clean and the free breakfast was more extensive than expected. There was a mini-fridge as well. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We were able to easily walk to the tourist attractions like Space Needle and there was a Walgreens just a block away for incidentals<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR114811747">We selected this hotel based on Trip Advisor. Never again will we make the same mistake. Trip advisor did not show that there was a Hampton Inn right in the same block, which is likely a much better choice. There was little "quality" about this "inn," which was filled to the rafters with tour bus groups and the cleanliness left much to be desired. Breakfast was like a manic feeding frenzy of folks who were acting like it was thier last meal before a famine.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR114723670">don't get me wrong. The location and price (group rate for Seattle Rock'n'Roll Marathon) for the hotel is not too bad but I know a few people (me included) chose this hotel because of its advertisement for hotel's amenities. This is what's on the hotel's website. Our hotel includes an array of amentities: * Shuttle to start of marathon When I checked in (around 4.30-5 p.m. and check-in time is 3 p.m.), I requested for a spot for the shuttle and was told that no spots available. It's on first come first serve basis. That's fine but if so, shouldn't the hotel put that in their ad. I heard a few other people that were checking in about the same time, told the hotel that that's why they chose this hotel. So if next year, you want to choose this hotel, make sure you get your spot. otherwise, stay at or near the official hotel or Qwestfield where the official shuttle buses depart.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR109144669">Stayed here since it had a special hospital rate. Not sure how that is calculated but we didn't get the same rate, but still an okay value. They offered a free shuttle to hospital but anywhere else was about 10-15 bucks for a few blocks or to go to a Mariners game or to one of the popular piers. Located down town and just a few blocks from the Space Needle. A few more blocks to major attractions downtown. The ladies that checked us into the hotel were friendly and gave some good information about hotel and it's resources. The morning managers on the other hand were, not quite rude, but frustrating in trying to get them to give information such as shuttle times, wake up calls and checking out. The room is super small. The dresser drawers couldn't open all the way because the queen bed was occupying the same space. Found a random earring on the dresser. Uses deodorizers so if you're sensitive to extra fragrances it might be difficult but otherwise it was pleasant and not overly perfumey. Overall a fair price for an okay room in a great location I'd stay here again because of price and hotel/ hospital shuttle but am willing to spend a bit more for next time.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR108387519">We booked this hotel because of the good rate and how close it was to the venue for a concert we were attending. If I had known that there was a travelodge next door I would have booked it there instead. I was very unhappy with the service that we received from the front desk staff, who was quite rude and would not answer our questions. Not only that, the rooms we had booked were unavailable, and our group was dispersed through out the hotel... We were also never informed that the hotel was under renovation.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR106414894">Hotel is in a great location within close walking distance to the space needle and tram, and also offers a shuttle service which due to the limited parking, is a great thing to take advantage of. Staff went above and beyond to make sure we knew where everything was and had some great recomendations for dinner etc.....especially the shuttle driver (younger big male shaved head) he took us anywhere we needed to go! There are loads of resteraunts and bars within a short walk, breakfast spread was huge, only complaint was it was in the heart of downtown so both of the rooms we stayed in were smaller than we would have liked and the rooms didn't have refridgerators but they were clean and serviceable rooms.

<comment category="positive" id="UR104418755">The Quality Inn near downtown Seattle is a well maintained, older property. I guess the building is 30+ years old. My room was very large, clean, quiet, and well maintained. Since the hotel is a non-smoking facility it is cleaner than average. The morning breakfast is noticeably superior to the standard fare. The hotel is located near the Space Needle and the monorail provides very good access to the heart of downtown. The hotel is located in a good neighborhood with several other hotels nearby. I should note that the I think that I received a complimentary room upgrades. I doubt if the standard rooms are huge including a Jacuzzi. However, if I were assigned a standard I still would have been a happy customer. Finally, I found the price to be reasonable.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR101552163">This was my first vacation alone so I was a little apprehensive that the hotel wouldn't be everything I hoped it would. All my worries were for nothing however, as I was greeted by a very comfortable hotel. I got the lowest rate room, a room with a single queen, and for me it was perfect. The room was meticulously clean and smelled great, everything was in good condition, and I was impressed by the view of the city I had. PROS: Clean rooms, great service, good prices, within walking distance of just about everything (and if it isn't in walking distance you can hop a bus and get there), lots of restaurant choices, comfortable bed, beautiful pool/hot tub area, FREE PARKING!, and extremely knowledgeable staff. CONS: The breakfast was pretty unimpressive so I slept in and ate out instead, there were still renovations being done and the elevators (which were being renovated) were scary as heck. If you go while they are still renovating, I would suggest taking the stairs. The TV in my room was outdated and had a bluish tint (but I didn't mind because I wasn't there to watch television). I thought there would be a microwave/fridge in my room but it turns out those are only for the double and king rooms which was disappointing but I just used the cooler I'd brought. Finally, the internet was really touchy. I couldn't get it to work until late the first night, and then it was over-all okay but would lag down and sometimes not work altogether at times throughout the trip. Over-all it was a great stay and I'd gladly stay again. I got a fantastic rate, especially considering their free parking offer is unmatched by any other hotel in the area. Everything was comfortable and clean, and this hotel room was perfect for me because I was there to explore the city and really used my hotel room for sleeping and relaxing. I'd absolutely recommend this hotel to a friend. ALSO: I would suggest signing up for the Choice Hotels rewards program. I did this downstairs at the counter and immediately my check-out time for the next day was moved from 12pm to 2pm, which really relieved the pressure of getting reading and getting out the next morning.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR100014713">My wife and I stayed here for a marriage weekend and were physically in the hotel for the entire weekend. Here's the rundown: CONS: The first room we were put in was in a section of the hotel undergoing renovations. The hall had exposed cabling and the walls were being worked on. Our room was small and faced Aurora which is a very noisy street. (we were moved later - see PROS.) The hotel building itself was poorly built - the bathroom tile floor was freezing cold (the second floor sits over the parking area - my guess is no insulation in the floor) and the halls and the meeting room were very cold and drafty at times. The area of the city the hotel is in is just OK - a little sketchy but a quick walk to great restaurants and Seattle Center. PROS: We realized we made an error in our reservation and were moved to a different room already reserved for us by the conference. The manager was very friendly and helpful and canceled our old reservation no charge, no problem even though we had already checked in several hours earlier. The new room was in a newly renovated part of the hotel that was tastefully decorated and the room itself was big and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. We had all of our meals for the conference catered by the hotel and the food was very good - much better than food I've had at more upscale hotel conferences. The hotel rates are really good for Seattle in an area walkable to city happenings. In short - I think most people wouldn't be in the hotel all weekend like we were for the conference. If hotel atmosphere is very important to you, you may want to pass on this one. If you want a clean, comfortable place to sleep with helpful staff at a good rate, and you're exploring the city, this would be an economical and good choice.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR99469301">Stayed for one night while traveling on Amtrak. The location is very good for tourists, 2 blocks from the Space Needle. Travel to the train station, downtown, and stadium area was also convenient using the monorail and bus tunnel. The hotel was undergoing some renovations during my stay so the elevator was out of service and some of the hallways were tore up. The room was a little dated and could use some work (hopefully will be addressed with the current renovations.) The lobby, pool, and breakfast areas were very nice and the continental breakfast was very good. Overall the hotel was a good deal and hopefully will be even better after renovations are complete. Next time I'm in Seattle I will stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR99168298">This Quality Inn more than makes up for in quality of service and facilities what it may lack in any other area. It was built for the 1962 World's Fair and perhaps let slide for some time. The current GM, Heather Patrick, is doing a magnificent job of restoring the Inn's luster. Her staff, without exception, went out of their way to see to our every need. They are proud of their house and rightly so. The hotel is very close to the Space Needle and attractions that are built on the World's Fair site. There is a shuttle offering free rides to anyplace within a mile and a half radius of the hotel and that more than covers the entire downtown area, including Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and the waterfront. The rooms are somewhat small, as rooms were built back then, but well appointed. Everything worked; fridge, microwave, coffee pot, television,clock radio, iron and telephone, and the bed was very comfortable. The "accessible" bathroom was wonderful; good solid bars to hang on to and a non-skid shower with molded seats. I understand there are some larger suites on the fifth floor (where scenes for the Elvis movie, "It Happened At The World's Fair" were filmed). The plentiful breakfast buffet (including the obligatory waffles) had hot food that was hot and cold food that was cold and furthermore it was tended by smiling, cheerful people. The pool and hot tub are exceptional in every way. I make it a point not to stay in a hotel that does not offer these amenities and so have many to compare these with. The pool is free form concrete with a terrific shallow end for little people and an 8.5 foot deep end for the swimmers. The water temperature was warmer than one might expect but given the raw, rainy outdoors, it was lovely to bask in. The hot tub, up six or seven steps (with a railing), was hot and the jets well placed. Both pool and tub were spotlessly clean every time I visited AND the facility is open from 6 am to 12 pm. There is a fitness room if you are inclined that way. My elderly mother (who uses a walker to get around) and I stayed here for six nights. It was a pleasure. At the time of our stay, the elevators were undergoing refurbishment which made for some inconvenience but not enough to make a serious difference to anything. The lobby boasts a business center, free coffee, 24 hour front desk, comfortable couches and a fireplace - with fire! One more fascinating thing: On the bottom of the pool, in the shallow end, there is a painting on ceramic tiles. It is signed by "Klee Wyn" and I can't find out anything about it. Perhaps it was put there for the making of the movie? It's pretty, depicting a mermaid and a young man in a bathing suit with fish and sea plants around. Worth a stay just to look at it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR96939114">We have stayed at the Ramada, Travel Lodge ,Westin and the Quality Inn since we have been making the Anual September Pilgrimage to Seattle. Ramada was sorry, Travel Lodge by the Needle was so disgusting I was refunded $90. Should have been more. Then we found this place. Yeah the elevators are slow (supposed to be upgraded now) and the carpets need replacing. Yet other than this,for the money and location, it can not be beat. We even stayed down the road at the Westin one year, yeah swanky, but no free parking, it cost me a fortune as I have an overheight vehicle, I had to valet the 3 days. We always come back here. Walk to the Needle and surrounding grounds, Top Pot donuts, Dicks Burgers,walking distance to downtown and Pikes. Also the heated pool which my 3 kids love and you can not beat the savings on a free breakfast for a family of 5. I am making my reservation tonight for our return this September.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR91421116">I don't expect much when I book a Quality Inn. Two stars should mean a clean, comfortable room and not much else. Our room was fairly clean and this place isn't a dive. But the owners cut corners where they shouldn't. The towels are awful, like scratchy sandpaper. We skipped our showers this morning to avoid them, they're that bad. My husband couldn't get a hot shower all day New Year's Day. I assume they were close to capacity, but shouldn't they be prepared for that? The walls are paper thin, which is to be expected I guess. A child's coughing woke me up this morning and I am not a light sleeper. The elevator is so slow, we saw more people simply give up and take the stairs than wait 20 minutes. We ended up carrying our bags up to the 3rd floor. I am writing this review from a coffee shop because I could not access the internet for 2 days. What's the point of free WiFi if it doesn't work? There's a Hyatt Place and a Best Western nearby that are probably a lot better than this place. Don't waste your money. The owners needs to take the ridiculous fee I was charged for a New Year's Eve rate and buy some towels. They clearly don't take much pride in this place which is too bad because it's in a great location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR90360125">After spending 3 hours traveling the 15 miles from Seatac airport to the center of Seattle in a subfreezing winter storm, my husband and I abandoned our plan to drive home to Bellingham 90 miles north of the city. Leaving I-5, we negotiated our way to a parking lot and began calling hotels in the area. We were able to book a room at Quality Inn and Suites Seattle Center. We didn't have a map and were unfamiliar with the area, and several streets were blocked by snow and ice. John, the Commercial Manager, stayed on the phone with us for 15 minutes, giving us precise directions to the hotel. He greeted us at the door, gave us hugs, and led us to a free, covered parking spot adjacent to the hotel. There was a fire burning in the lobby fireplace, where I warmed myself while my husband registered. We not only got a room with a king-size bed at a more than reasonable price, we were upgraded to one with a jacuzzi. The staff was wonderful, the room clean and comfortable, and after a hearty complimentary breakfast the next morning we were on our way home.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR88477004">I booked two adjoining rooms through Expedia for a weekend in November. My decision was influenced because they had a pool and adjoining rooms. When we got there, the pool was closed due to maintenance.....for the whole weekend. I assume it was due to the comments below where the pool water turned some people's hair green. Not only was the pool closed but I was told they don't guarantee adjoining rooms which we called before we booked on Expedia to ensure we would have rooms that were adjoining.....not just next to each other. Jennifer remembered speaking to me about this and denied telling me we would have adjoining rooms. I would not have booked the room if we could not get adjoining rooms. We had five young kids tired after a long drive (5 hrs) and I just wanted to get checked in. After a long wait and conversations with different front desk staff unsuccessfully trying to come up with an alternative solution, I was told they would let us out of the reservations if Expedia would let us out. So, on the phone with Expedia for an hour we were given the green light to cancel our reservation, however, when they did this while I was on hold, the manager of Quality Inn, Heather Patrick, denied waiving our $80 cancellation fee. Not only would she not listen to my complaint, was rude and unhelpful, I was appalled at her lack of customer service. She blamed everything on Expedia and refused to offer any help whatsoever. She said, "I don't care what my staff did (referring to her manager Jason who told us the hotel would let us out if Expedia would), I'm the General Manager and I'm not letting you out of the cancellation fee because you did not cancel 24hrs in advance." I called the Holiday Inn Express next door and their pool was open and they had adjoining rooms we could get for both nights. I was so disgusted with the staff of this Quality Inn that I didn't care about the fee anymore at this point, I was not staying there! We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and had a great rest of our vacation. The kids had a great time in the pool all weekend and the staff there knew how to treat their customers. They even apologized for our experience and were embarrassed that hospitality staff would treat anyone such as the way we were treated by Heather and her staff. Oh and Expedia ended up waiving our cancellation fee and booking our room at the Holiday Inn Express for the same price. I would have gladly paid the higher rate......the customer service was well worth it.<topic>none</topic>

Great layout with one bathroom. Updated kitchen. Carpet was disgusting. Phones did not work and tv remote did not work. Had a pool but was down for maintenance and no one phoned us prior to us arriving to let us know it was down. One of the main reasons we chose to stay there. They gave us the room for $125 a night to compensate. Amazing price for the area, we walked EVERYWHERE. Free parking too. Free internet (super slow) and continental breakfast was the typical make your own waffle deal. In a nutshell we would stay here again for the price and location.

<comment category="negative" id="UR85101421">We spent 6 nights at the Quality Inn &amp; Suites Seattle Center on John Street. The parking was okay - not as bad as others had let us to believe by their reviews. The halls are in need of updating. The elevators are a pain - always slow. The breakfasts were hardly sufficient. What food we did get was awful &amp; it was always overly crowded. We'd hoped for good coffee since we WERE in Seattle... but it was standard hotel coffee. The hot water in our shower didn't work one morning &amp; when I called the office to report it, they offered to move me to another room. I couldn't do that, however, as I was in town for a competition and needed to get ready and leave by a certain time. Housekeeping failed to clean our room one day and we were gone a good part of the day. We didn't say any thing about it until the following day because we were gone in the evening &amp; just wanted to relax and not have to deal with it. We did mention it the next day. We did tip our housekeeper every day. There was a slider that opened up to a communal patio on the roof... no view - just the highway, but better than nothing. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in our room. The bed was comfy except for the dip in the middle of the (king) bed, where you tended to roll. We did find a good pizza place nearby - but they didn't deliver. The Space Needle is viewable from areas of the hotel and within walking distance. The hot tub by the pool was relaxing. The high speed internet was remarkably slow. I would recommend this hotel for someone just looking for a place to crash. If you're looking for a luxurious vacay experience - keep looking.<topic>none</topic>

Quality Inn beat Travelodge's price's by about $15 per room. Quality Inn also offered free parking whereas Travelodge wanted to charge us $12 to park our car. Parking is a little tight at Quality Inn but we did find a space. If you walk out to the end of the hotel lot you can see the Space Needle. The girls at the front desk were very courteous and helpful in helping us find a restauant at a late hour.

<comment category="negative" id="UR78567551">This hotel offers a cruise and park special - 238 dollars, excellent package considering they include up to 2 weeks parking and the shuttle back and forth to the ship. We stayed at the Maxwell for three nights before moving here so we were a little spoiled. As we were already in town and were told that the parking was limited we arrived early. Rooms were not available so we waited in the lobby. The lobby area is run down, outdated and dirty. Our room 219 was ready at about 1:30 which was fine - it is a very busy hotel. We took the elevator up - slow and creaky! Room 219 was disgusting, the carpets filthy and badly stained. I quickly looked down the hall at some other rooms, as they were being cleaned, and went back to the front desk. I asked the women for another room at the other end of the hall. She asked if the room had been cleaned and I said yes but that it was still disgusting and I was not about to sleep in it. She moved us to another room that was a bit better. The hotel has great potential ! Good location, indoor pool and work out room. Large breakfast area and parts of it have been updated. They need to update, clean and get new furniture for the lobby. The rooms and hallways all need to be completely refurbished. The elevators also need to be updated - they literally creek and are very slow. Stairs are easily accessible, but when you have several suitcases an elevator is necessary. They have laundry facilities but when we used the dryer it ruined two white shirts , they came out covered in grease!! For Seattle this is the best cruise and park package available but if I weren't going to use that particular package I would recommend you go somewhere else until this place cleans up its act!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR78435352">My husband had a Microsoft gathering to attend in Downtown Seattle. I searched on Trip Advisor before I chose here and I am glad I did!! The rates inside of Downtown Seattle were 2-3X as much as this place PLUS they all charged extra for parking &amp; WiFi and so we figured hey, let's pay a little less for the Quality Inn and just walk everywhere. And that is what we did. We stayed mid-week for 3 nights. The $69 rate was very reasonable. The WI-FI and parking are free!! It looks as if there is not enough parking but there really is; they have another "secret" secure gated parking area underneath the hotel. You have to go around to Thomas Street to get to it. I felt very safe leaving my car there for 3 days. There is an elevator in the "secret" parking area that goes straight up to the hotel. Yes, the elevators are slow but they get you to where you have to go. Some people complained about the noise but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. The front part of the hotel faces a busy street but when you are inside you don't even hear it. The back part faces another hotel and is very quiet. Once in a while you can hear people walking in the hallway but that is only if they are chattering away and have big mouths. The room walls are about the same. If you are a light sleeper like me just bring earplugs and you won't hear a thing. The rooms aren't huge but they are very cozy and have a Fridge, Micro, Coffee. Some of the rooms have a view of the Space Needle. The bathrooms are very clean. The shower is hot with excellent water pressure. The beds are very comfy. I found no bugs, trash, weird odors, etc...in the room. It was very clean and tidy and housekeeping was great about keeping everything stocked for us. (I did tip them daily.) The indoor pool and spa are heated. The pool area is very clean. There are towels for you in the pool area. The only gripe I could say about the pool/spa area is the chlorine fumes but it isn't too bad. The FREE breakfast was great but the line fills up FAST so if you get down there anytime past 7, expect to wait. The good part is that everything is cooked fresh and you don't leave hungry. The breakfast crew does their best to bus tables, keep the counters clean, and serve everyone but when they are busy they can get behind on table cleaning. (It isn't their fault.) I made sure to clean up my table after I was finished so the next guy had a place to sit and eat. (I also tipped these guys daily. They worked their butts off!!) The hotel staff I encountered were very helpful from day one. They helped me find everything on the downtown maps, showed me which way to walk, which areas to avoid, etc... Hubby and I had a late night the last night we were in town and so I asked for a late check out and they let me stay until 2 PM!! ( THANK YOU GUYS!! ) Everything around the hotel you can either walk or ride the bus to. If you walk just a few blocks down it puts you into the "Free Bus Zone" and then you can just hop from bus to bus touring the city. We did this when going to Chinatown, Union Station, Pikes Market, Waterfront piers &amp; shopping, etc... We walked to the Space Needle and caught the monorail ($2 each way) into downtown, walked around, had a nice dinner, then caught the bus back. The next day we walked to the free bus zone and took the bus down to the Ferry Piers, and went on a beautiful Ferry ride over to Bainbridge Island. If you want to see Downtown Seattle a very cheap ($7) and beautiful way, the Ferries are the way to go!! The only thing I would say to avoid is the McDonalds across from the Space Needle. There are a lot of drug addicts &amp; homeless in the vicinity and sometimes they filter into the restaurant asking for $$. One woman strung out on something came in and started screaming and yelling and got violent with the manager for forgetting a pickle on her hamburger. Fortunately when the cops came they all scattered but it was still scary. All in all this place is a very great value for the price. Trust me I did my research! The only thing I would recommend is that if you have 2 people who use laptops is to ask for another chair for your room. Otherwise you will have to "surf" from either the bed or sit on the suitcase rack. :)<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR78161983">the directions to the inn were bad enough. Then, the employees still can't give decent directions to their own parking garage- and I know that we weren't alone because other visitors were driving around looking for it also. Finally, "simple" directions to the Zoo "10 minutes away" turned into a 45minute wild goose hunt. THANKS A LOT... :P<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR74993832">We were happy with our recent stay here. Yes, the rooms are small. Yes, the bathrooms are even smaller. But the shower was great, hot water, nice and clean. Everything was clean. The elevators are slow, and old, but there are stairs...and the parking is FREE!! We walked everywhere we needed to go, the location was great. Cant complain for the price we paid. Pillows are tiny though--I mean 2 together are the size of a standard pillow. Take your own. Breakfast was impressive, there were many choices and it was great (and also FREE!) Swimming pool was great, a few broken tiles here and there, but nothing horrible. We enjoyed it. All in all, well worth it. We would stay there again-- I would rather stay here for a reasonable rate, and be able to walk everywhere then have to drive into the city and park downtown everyday! PS-my recommendation would depend who I was referring, if you want a 4 or 5 star hotel this is not for you. If you want a budget hotel that is affordable, clean and in a good location then this is the hotel for you!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR68784487">We chose this hotel as a jump-off for our cruise, as they provide parking at no additional charge. However, it was a miserable experience, full of large, screaming families, reeking of chlorine from the heavily shocked pool, and insanely small room. The common areas were dirty and run down, the room was relatively clean, but smelled terrible. The window gave a view into the parking lot and the room of the people in the hotel nest door. The bed was so hard I couldn't sleep -- thank God I brought my own pillow, because those were in short supply as well. The air conditioner works and the plumbing works. But I have a bit higher standards and I would rather forgo the so-called convenience for a decent night's sleep. Lousy start to a vacation, but it made our ship stateroom look HUGE!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR63861209">We wanted a hotel that was near The Childrens Hospital and we got it. But lets see...the hot tub was green and the pool was not well maintained. The rooms were nice...I will give them that with a lot of amenities I didn't expect in a basic room like stove and dishwasher. But the bathroom was TINY!! And the beds, they put me in the hospital because of my back. NO JOKE!! They are THE WORST!! The TV was bad it kept messing up and then to top it off the teams that were in the place was not supervised well because they kept knocking on our door at all hours and running off. And a call to the front desk did not provide results. SO my recommendation for travelers is to AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!! And the review below about the elevators yah I agree. They have three elevators in the hotel and the ONLY one working brought you to the parking garage and you had to hike in to do anything!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR59542499">The hotel is old, with very slow elevators. The rooms are small, though well kept. The location is only 2 blocks from the Space Needle and related attractions, so it is in a good place. As others say, the carpet is outdated and worn, though the beds and water pressure was good. The breakfast was fine. We are a family of five. We paid $75 for one room and $103 for another. In retrospect, for less money we could have stayed at a Westin Suite in much nicer accommodations for less. Few frills, high prices. We won't be going back to this hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR59475501">We planned to stay for two nights, but left after one. The hotel was dated and dirty. Linens were old and dingy. The double beds were so old and worn that we rolled to the middle of the bed. They were VERY uncomfortable. The room was extremely small, with just room to walk around the beds. Road noise was high. The elevators are very old, and the sensors don't work properly. If you aren't careful, the door will hurt you. Watch out! The location is somewhat central, but it's ugly. All of the equipment in the "fitness center" was broken in one way or another. On the bright side, most of the staff was nice, but the manager made up for it. She refused to take care of a parking ticket their hired service issued despite the fact that we were guests and parked legally in a space in their garage. She said she could take care of it, but that she wouldn't. (Huh??) It made no sense then and still doesn't. We went to another hotel, which was clean, bright, friendly and cheaper! There are MUCH better options!!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR59437562">1. Skip swimming. Indoor pool is dirty and not properly maintained. 2. Check everything in the room before settlign in - the guest service pointed out it is the guestâ€™s responsibility to inspect the room before settling in (i.e. faulty shower rod - you may lose your head). According to the Hotel Act, which was posted on the door, it is their responsiblity to ensure everything in the room is in good condition. 3. Ask them not to you in with a high school group. Or you won't get any sleep. 4. Breakfast is basic - not what they say. I will never go back to this hotel for their lack of customer service, inability to handle complaints, their improper management of facilities and false advertisement of the facility. The guest clerk assured that the manager will be in contact. It is a ploy to avoid you. We booked this hotel because of its direct link to the Woodland Park Zoo - don't do it. There are better places to stay.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR59391566">Oh my gosh -- I haven't seen this filthy of a hotel for . . . well, I can't remember when! The parking lot was a preview, but my wildest imagination couldn't have prediccted what the hallway carpets looked like! The elevator was abysmal. I'm not talking about new dirt or litter -- I'm talking about ground-in crud that would never ever come out! The rooms are old and not much better -- tho the bedding was clean and crisp. The closet was the smallest hole I've ever seen (smaller than a tall locker!) We stood in the room, recapped the clients that we saw on our way in -- and said -- we're out of here! I was afraid for the safety of my suitcases while we went down to try to get out of our non-refundable reservation. The office staff (the oriental young man) was especially kind and graciously did not charge us after all. Don't waste your time even THINKING about this hotel!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR59079817">We spent 5 nights at Quality Inn &amp; Suites and it was great. The room was clean and there was adequate space. We booked a suite that had 1 king size bed in the first room with a small kitchenette and the second bedroom had 2 double beds and a bathroom to the side. This room comes with 2 TVs. The pool was a hit with the kids and the hot tub was clean and hot. They picked us up from the Amtrak station for $15 including 7 trunks. And dropped us at the airport at the end for $30, again with 7 trunks and all our other hand luggage. In the US, it is difficult to find hotels that cater to for 5 people where the parents don't have to room with the children for any price, so, this hotel was great for us. And the price was good too. The hotel front desk staff were great, some of them even helped us figure out which buses to take to visit a few of the further flung locations we wanted to get to. And of course it is only a few blocks to Seattle Center, so one can just walk there. Breakfast was included and while it wasn't a great breakfast (we eat mostly fruit and don't like lots of wheat and starch), the breakfast was similar to that we've had in other hotels in the US. I do think that the rooms at the front of the hotel might be noisier as the hotel is on a busy street, but we had a room facing the back and looking onto the hotel next door. Not a great view, but we slept fine. So if noise will be a problem for you, ask for a room facing the back. We used the kitchenette to make sandwiches and to eat takeout foods from the grocery stores nearby. We don't usually dine out as our younger children are not adventurous eaters, so paying a small fortune to eat in an expensive restaurant where the kids don't like the food doesn't make sense to us. We didn't want to eat McDonalds all week either, so the kitchenette was very handy. It is not a fully equiped kitchen. There is a sink, stove, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a dishwasher, but there are limited pots and pans and only a few plates and bowls. But it was adequate for our needs as I didn't want to cook meals. The hotel was close to two very good grocery stores, one in the Pan Pacific Hotel and a QFC at the bottom Seattle Center on 5th. Both are about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The store in the Pan Pacific Hotel was more expensive, but they had a bigger selection of takeout foods that were relatively healthy. Both stores had lots of fruit and veg including organic foods. I'd stay in this hotel again if I needed to go to Seattle and wanted to stay near the Space Needle or downtown, especially if I was traveling with children or teenagers. They even have free parking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR55434770">Used the Quality Inn and Suites for a quick one night stay. We traveled to Seattle to attend a concert at Key Arena, and this was a great choice in terms of location. A 10 min walk takes you right to Seattle Center where you can find the Space Needle, Key Arena, the Fun Forest which has rides for the kids, and so much more. We walked 2 blocks over from Key Arena to Queen Anne street and checked out the little shops and various restaurants offered there. The hotel itself we could tell had been redone with granite fixtures in the bathroom, and updated tile and carpeting. The room we booked was for 2 queens, but the room did feel quite small. The hotel is on a busy street on one side, but that did not bother us at all excepting for the ambulance that happened to go by. We did get awakened by some sort of delivery truck at 5am, but the noise was brief enough that I could go back to sleep. The hotel offers a pool and hot tub which are open until midnight. The free breakfast in the morning consisted of pastries, toast, bagels, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, waffles, juice, coffee and tea. This was served from 6:30 -9:30 am. Parking was free, but was limited and the lot filled easily. The front desk mentioned that there was an alternate parking underground lot which required your room key as a pass to get in. The hotel overall was clean and the clerks at the front were very helpful with information and even gave me a toothbrush as I had forgotten mine. Check in/out times were 3pm and noon. The clerk did mention that if we wanted late check out at 2pm to ask in the morning for availability. This was not necessary for us, but a nice touch for them to mention. For the location and price we would stay again if we needed a hotel in this area.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR54438630">We stayed at the Quality Inn while attending the AFBF meeting. The staff at the front desk knew most our destinations and had maps to draw walking routes on for us. As no Seattle streets go straight for long, the maps were very helpful! The breakfast host was fantastic. We stayed four nights and my husband said goodbye to him on the third morning, saying our plane left too early to eat the next morning. No problem, the young man said, I will come in early and you can still have breakfast. We love that kind of service! And the hot breakfasts made for a great start to our days. Friends of ours also stayed at this hotel. She had left her cane at home, and the hotel loaned her one for the duration of our trip. Again, I think that is above and beyond service. For $87 a night, we were treated like royalty with great breakfasts, helpful front desk people, and nicely made up rooms each night with out personal hot tub (the hotel pool was gorgeous, too).<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR48869570">Our family stayed in the hotel. The second I arrived I knew it was going to be a great stay. We had no trouble getting into the room and a very nice guy parked the car in their specialized garage. The swimming pool was humungous and led to almost an hour of swimming. They recommended an italian restaurant called Buca de Bepo. Moi delesioso! It was a 3 minute walk to the needle and 1 LRT ride away from the market with the original starbucks. In general this is an amazing hotel. Not mentioning the amazing breakfast. The regular continental breakfast with hot food as well. The T.v's were kind of small but way better than some of the others we saw on our trip.

<comment category="positive" id="UR47316026">We stayed here for a week while touring Seattle. This was a nice hotel with everything we needed. I was given a choice of room and wanted a quieter room so we stayed on the side opposite the highway. The rooms were good and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was great and included scrambled eggs and sausage. The surface parking lot was full at times but there is also a gated lot that connects to the elevator and is accessed with the room key. We always found a spot. It was convenient to the Seattle Center and a long walk to the Farmers Market water area. I felt that the area was safe. There were restaurants in the area and the hotel staff were very helpful and suggest places to eat. There is a patio on the second floor and the rooms there open onto this area which would have been good with kids. The computer in the lobby could be used for a charge but airline tickets were printed free. There is also a fitness room and laundry. The only drawback was that the hot tub was lukewarm most of our 9 nights stay which would not be a problem if you don't like a hot tub. We would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic>

Tiny,dirty rooms with very thin walls- kept up all night by loud neighbors. Small parking lot.

<comment category="negative" id="UR38846680">Finding this hotel was tricky as the sat nav took us to the correct road, however we were on the wrong side of dual carriage way that could not be crossed - worth getting a local map in advance of staying to approach it from the right direction. The reception staff were friendly and useful when we made queries about Seattle and where to find specific shops and tourist attractions that we wished to visit. The hotel is very close to the Space Needle (within walking distance) which makes it good value for money. The aircon was noisy at night but not so bad that it was worth a complaint.

The room was tiny, noisy, and smelled bad. I had reserved a crib, reminded them when I checked in, and then still had to call the front desk after I got to the room to ask them to bring one up. The internet connection was too slow to use and disconnected before you could complete anything. The vending machine on our floor was out of water so I walked to a gas station about a block away for some. I think I was the only sober person at the gas station except the clerk. I didn't feel very safe walking at night (late, but still light) in the neighborhood. Parking was free but there weren't enough spaces for the number of guests.

<comment category="positive" id="UR37975647">We had booked two nights in this hotel through Venere. When we arrived, the reception staff couldn't find our name, Venere hadn't booked us a room. Fortunately we had printed the confirmation and no money had been taken. The staff has been extremely helpful, they gave us a room (which I thought wouldn't be possible as it was the w-e of July 4th and that they had told other people that they were full!!) for the same price as offered on the internet. Looking at the pictures and the previous reviews, it seems we had a pretty big room (two double beds). Everything was really clean, of course it was a bit noisy as we overlooked the freeway but it was not the noisiest hotel we stayed at during our stay in the US. The swimming pool was clean and the water was a nice temperature. The breakfast was excellent with waffle makers, bagels, muffins... It is a walking distance to the Space Needle (a must see attraction) and a 15 min walk to downtown. The only negative point was that the internet connection on the computer of the lobby was really really expensive!! We stayed in cheaper hotels with free internet in the lobby!! But we would definitely stay in this hotel again as the staff was so nice and helpfull!!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR37883545">Our first trip to Seattle, booked Quality Inn online because of price, location and other reviews. This was the first time I've ever switched hotels after making a two-night reservation. Let me start with the positive, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was extremely small, had to walk sideways between the dresser and the bed. Very noisy, due to location/proximity to freeway, and the air conditioner was just about as noisy as the freeway. Unable to plug in microwave, TV, and coffemaker at the same time due to unavailability of outlets. Towels were paper thin, and knees almost hit the sink when sitting on the toilet. Elevators were slow, and the overall appearance of the hotel was grimy/dirty. We didn't swim in the pool, but another guest (who I met in the elevator) told me it was freezing, supposed to be heated, but clearly not. Switched to LaQuinta a few blocks away for second night in Seattle -- very pleased, well worth the additional twenty bucks!<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR37304479">I definitely would NOT stay there again. Rooms are too small even for 2 people. Beds are advertised as queen, but they were not queen sized beds. No counter in the extremely small bathroom, so no place to put things you are using. Not enough room to put out the luggage holder without tripping over it or stubbing your toe.. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hallways not air conditioned. If I had brought my laptop, there wouldn't have been anyplace to put it on the desk that was crammed in the corner. It had the coffee pot, ice bucket &amp; glasses on it and no where to move it to. If you like a quiet room, ask for a room away from the road. I couldn't believe that there wasn't any place to park. They advertise that they will let you leave your car there while on a cruise, but what about the other guests that are staying there while you're on your cruise? Lack of parking was a big deal to us. We had to PAY to park in a dark alley behind the hotel. If I had paid full price for the room, I would have been very, very angry.<topic>none</topic>

The location is good, very near the space needle and although we didn't go up the needle, we did go on the Duck tour (highly recommended) which was near the needle. It was about a 15 minute walk to the centre of the downtown area, but if you go down Denny Way towards Westlake Drive it is more picturesque than going any other way. Whole Foods Market is nearby and we had breakfast there twice. We didn't use the buffet breakfast in the hotel as both times we looked in it was very crowded - obviously popular! There was a pool and hot tub which looked clean although we didn't use them either. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives - the room and indeed the whole corridor had a 'sour milk' fragrance going on! Not sure if this is the smell from the cleaning fluids or what. The air conditioning unit in the room was VERY loud so we had to suffer the heat at night as we turned it off. You could also hear the people above moving around above us. Having said this, the bedding and bathroom were very clean. We wouldn't let the above put is off staying here again and indeed talking to the staff just before they left, they said the hotel is always full and very popular with families.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR36757009">We stayed for three nights and had problems parking everytime we returned to the hotel. When there is a parking space it is next to impossible to get out or you are in danger of someone else hitting your car. They say to park at your own risk. On the street parking is available at $1.25 per hour between 8 am and 6 pm Mon - Sat. Free on Sunday. Or you can park in one of the local pay lots for $9.00 per day or more. Everything else about this hotel was great. Our room with the King bed was bigger than the ones with the 2 queens. The Breakfasts provided were excelent. The kids loved the pool and workout center. So if you choose this hotel, please come prepared to deal with the parking.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR36070666">Made and cancelled a reservation over the phone. Received no correspondence or verification regarding my reservation or cancellation because the hotel entered an incorrect email address, mailing address and spelled my name wrong in their system. Not surprising because I was put on hold numerous times during my calls regarding my original reservation and cancellation. Obvious confusion resulted in my reservation and cancellation and my reservation was never cancelled. Hotel charged me a $156 no-show charge for a reservation I had cancelled. Hotel management claims their system is failproof. They refuse to refund the no-show charge; however, they offered me a free night's stay to compensate me for my trouble. Why would the hotel offer me a free night's stay rather than refund the no-show charge that they should not have charged me? Obviously they know a mistake on their part was possible if offering some compensation. Hotel has simply responded through my Better Business Bureau complaint that they will not refund the no-show charge, but will provide a free night's stay to me. They will get away with this again, even if a small claims court awards me the reimbursement of the no-show charge. I recommend not staying here, not necessarily because of their mistake (mistakes happen) but because of the unscrupulous business practices of their management and their unwillingness to admit and correct their error. We stayed at a MUCH nicer hotel (I have stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle Center on two occassions before this incident), Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel for just a little bit more money. The hotel was high class, quiet, room and staff were great and the location was within walking distance of Safeco Field, Waterfront, downtown, many restaurants, coffee shops, Fish Market etc.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR35719885">I stayed two nights at this hotel and really appreciated the location (just a few blocks away from Seattle Center and from Greyhound bus station). Room was large enough for one person, beds highly comfortable, bathroom definitely okay. Breakfast enjoyable with quite a choice of stuff. Express check-out perfect. Rooms on the street side are a bit noisy but hey, you're in a city ! Overal, I would recommend this hotel if you're not staying a long time in Seattle and want to enjoy the most of it.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34794796">I stayed here with friends for two nights. This hotel has kind of a 1960s motor hotel theme going on. Our room had two queen beds but was a little cramped. The location and the breakfast were easily the two best features of the hotel. We were only a few blocks from the Space Needle and the Sci-Fi Museum/Experience Music Project. It was an easy walk to the "free zone" for the buses, which allowed us to get to Safeco Field for a Mariners game without driving or paying for a cab. The breakfast was a full hot buffet, with biscuits/gravy, sausage links, etc. Pool looked nice, but we didn't use it. The parking situation left a lot to be desired. There were no spots left the night we arrived, so I had to park on the street (no charge) and move the car at 8:00 the next morning to avoid feeding the meter or getting a ticket. A tip: Use your keycard to get into the underground garage off of Thomas St. I saw the gate and didn't realize guests could use it until after I'd already found a spot in the regular lot. The desk staff didn't make it clear that it was for guest use. Internet access was flaky in our room on the third floor near the end of the hall. I tethered with my BlackBerry for most of our stay. My last complaint is that it cost me $2 to receive (not send) a one-page fax. That can't really be justified in my mind. I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR34348920">The staff is what makes this place great. They are all very friendly and helpful. Our room was very small. A single queen (was it a queen though?) and barely enough room for two people. Free parking upon availability (= don't arrive after 8 PM with a car) made this one of the better values if you're driving. Location is good right near the needle, but not GREAT because there is a very busy highway bypass that runs right by the front - and this adds a fair amount of road noise - also it means you can't cross the street easily if you want to walk east. Free breakfast in the morning. There are a fair selection of eateries and such around, if you walk in and towards the water. At the end of the day it is a quality inn, and a reasonably well kept one at that once you get past the road noise and congestion of the location. Though the rooms are smaller than standard. I would say my stay here was positive, and would recommend with the above caveats.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR34176178">The main thing this hotel has going for it is its proximity to the needle and the park. Actually, you can walk a great number of places from this property. Also, the people working there are helpful and friendly. The hotel was pretty clean, and the rooms were in good shape so long as you are good with an early 1963 decor. Pretty new stuff, but still dated. If you will need internet service, I recommend you stay elsewhere. The wireless is free, and worth what you pay. The connection was miserably slow and the signal weak. Also, be careful out at night. We weren't approached by anyone, but we did see an illegal transaction going down.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33774882">We booked a two night stay after a cruise to see Seattle. The room had a great view of the Space Needle, just out the window of the room. Only two blocks from the needle and the monorail. The breakfast was OK not bad not great, same as most free breakfasts except they had scrambled eggs and ham. The only real complaint would be the very loud air conditioner and it didn't even cool the room down. A good clean hotel with free parking near major attractions.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR33061826">BAD EXPERIENCE! We purchased a Seattle Tour Saver, partly because of a 2 for 1 coupon for this hotel. The coupon states it for a value UP TO $197.98. When I attempted to reserve a room using the coupon the very polite young people answering the phone referred me to the manager, Heather Patrick. I told Ms. Patrick I wanted to use my coupon for the room at $89.99 per night listed in their hotel website. She said the price of the room would be $197.98 and with 2 for 1 coupon it would be $89.99 per nite. When I questioned this logic, she rudely told me to take it or leave it. Stay away from this hotel. If we are treated this rudely on the phone what would the hotel experience be?<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR27831022">I don't understand what all of the other poor reviews are about. The rooms are smaller than some places but you can walk two blocks to the space needle, swim in an indoor pool, it's 5 minutes from the zoo, a huge breakfast is included and the price is great. We were impressed with the helpfulness of the staff and of the extras we received for the price. We purchased the Zoo package and saved about $30 off of our zoo tickets. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, even remembering me from booking over the phone two weeks prior. There's a great indoor pool and hot tub and the rooms have been updated since we stayed last. Though there were some bleach spills on the carpet outside our room, the rest of the place was clean, beautiful and fit our needs perfectly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR23566062">Booked this hotel from the Internet and it was a great choice. Arrived after midnight and reception was very friendly and helpful. Nice room, complimentary breakfast and a spa and pool. Lobby was welcoming with a warm fire and free real coffee or chocolate milk. Desk very helpful with tourist information and booked a fantastic 1/2 day Seattle tour for us. Hotel very close to Space Needle, Science Museum and Monorail. Monorail convenient for getting into the City. There were six in our party and we all loved Seattle and this Hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR20451569">Stayed at this hotel before and after a cruise. The room booked by the travel agent was basic but on our return we booked extra days directly with the hotel and were given a fantastic room with a view of the Space Needle at a good budget price. Would definitely stay there again. Staff were very helpful. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Free tea and coffee 24 hours a day. Great location.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR20345096">My fiance and I chose to stay here because we wanted to be downtown without breaking the bank. The rooms are basic but adequate - especially if you plan to spend the majority of a weekend stay exploring Seattle, as we did. The location is excellent - walking distance to trendy Belltown shops and restaurants. We had a memorable Italian dinner at Barolo Ristorante, a ten minute walk from the hotel.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19760798">Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of August. The location is good if you are visiting the Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, monorail) and you are just a short bus ride (stops right out front) into downtown and Pike Place Market. We had one of the larger rooms on the 5th floor. While it was nice to have more space, not sure it was worth the extra money. The carpet was in need of a good cleaning or replaced. I would not walk barefoot on it. The bed was ok. The bathroom looked like it had been updated not long ago. We did find ants in the room on our last night but did not bother to complain since it was getting late and we would be checking out early in the morning. The breakfast was your typical free hotel breakfast, nothing fancy but was very crowded. The pool &amp; hottub were great to have and to pass a couple of hours in the evening since it was raining during our stay. We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and answered all our questions. We didn't have any issues with noise coming from the busy street below but that might be because we were on the top floor. Would we stay here again, maybe if we could get a better price and they did some updating.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19491634">My family of four (including 7 &amp; 9 year old boys) stayed at this downtown Seattle hotel for two (2) nights before an Alaskan cruise. It was one of the less expensive hotels in the area and I was not expecting luxury, but my overall stay was disappointing. On the good side, it is in a safe area just a few blocks from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and Pike's Market and the waterfront are walkable (although a little bit of a hike). However, the rooms and lobby are tired (the entire building really), the breakfast area overcrowded and it is serviced by a single, small, slow elevator. The advertised free shuttle to the dock was instead $6.00 per person and contracted out to a van service and the high speed internet was also down. The front desk staff was adequate, but I could have accomplished the same goals for less (with a better breakfast) at the adjoining Travelodge. At best, this is a 1-2 night hotel when waiting to go on a cruise (which about half of the guests were). For that purpose, it's fine. However, if you are visiting Seattle as your destination, I would look elsewhere.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR19488866">I had to make a last minute trip to Seattle while two conventions were going on and this was the closest hotel to the downtown area I could. When you arrive the dingy 70's exterior doesn't do a lot to ease your mind, nor does the location but once you get into your room things improve. It seems to be newly renovated and everything was clean. Bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, despite facing a rather busy street. The rooms are quite small but I live in NYC and I'm used to tight quarters so it didn't really bother me. The breakfast room makes your high school cafeteria feel like the Ritz and is a rather depressing start to the day, I'd skip it and talk a walk over to Belltown for a proper cup of coffee and any kind of breakfast you'd want. Totally acceptable for what it is, a motel on the edge of town.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="positive" id="UR19050632">I have been to my share of hotels and this one have surpassed my expectations. No dislikes at all. Hotel experience was amazing. Room was clean and comfortable. Great location at a reasonable rate. Customer service an A+. Look out for Ricky, cause he's the man! He'll get you more than what you need and is extremely friendly.<topic>none</topic>

<comment category="negative" id="UR18915881">Good points: The location is great -- a five minute walk to space needle. The continental breakfast is well stocked and is of good quality, the bathrooms are newer. Price is not out of line for downtown Seattle. Down side: Parking is a royal pain, not nearly enough of it. get there after five and good luck finding a space, staff not all that helpful in most regards. OLD hotel, very slow and rickety elevator. While bathrooms are clean and look new, they need to replace room carpets or something, because ours smelled like a gym bag filled with sweaty socks. Hallway smelled old and musty as well. plug in alarm clock in room did not work, had to call twice to ge a replacement, then the replacement(which was older than the original one) did not work either. It was okay for a one night stay before heading to the airport the next morning, and as I said quite close to space needle and tourist spots downtown.<topic>none</topic>

    <comment category="positive" id="32131596">  I saw the restaurant Victoria. Very good looks in the pictures, but the US is far from Lucky. In the hotel's Web site says that there will be free transportation from the hotel to the Centre and back. What is a shuttle, as a type of carriage used to transport them, I didn't even know that offer:) but as you have already written-shuttle service is usually a minibus moving on schedule</comment>
    <comment category="negative" id="32136927">  To returnees from velingrad-these days the news had a story that there was a mode of water-is it true? And that there was a problem with the water supply and in the hotels:( I was going to save for Christmas, but she had second thoughts.   Also in the news today that there are problems with the water, and that the streets are excavated, right in the Center. Does anyone know how it is at the moment the situation that these prices are not nakačili suggest jumping mud pits and draughts. On tv, he handed out buckets of water in the rooms-large SPA like no water.</comment>

I want to go again between holidays, but I don't know what the situation is and from now I don't want to risk it with reservations.   There was a problem with the power on March 8, a lot of snow had fallen and had a State of emergency. Then worked with several hotels agregar and again it was possible to rest. But without water, I can't imagine what SPA would be. And I want to book between the holidays, but now had second thoughts frankly.</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32137082">  Quite fresh impressions of the aura from last weekend. Last time I visited it the summer of 2010. The rooms, the bathrooms and the restaurant have been renovated, which is great, but the pools are slightly neglected. The water is clean and very warm, but here there are otk″rteni tiles on the bottom and sides. The polar bears are slightly blackened in places, cold water of nozzles in attraction trail are clogged and not working properly. The children's pool is fully opened, which for some parents is uncomfortable (I personally think it is better to strengthen one's children in such pools). The outdoor Jacuzzi with hot water and is open all year round. These baskets around the indoor pool are just two, and are sorely inadequate. The whole hotel was very warm, the water in the bathrooms is a mineral. Recommendation-walk in the days from Sunday to Thursday, is much more peaceful.  If anyone is interested in something in particular to ask.    I've been in this hotel and I liked it, my impressions are like yours, I visited him in March this year. But when we left, I found that there's another indoor pool, we noticed, I think, where the steam bath and the sauna-one floor below the reception. I was wrong and there really has another indoor pool? </comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32137144">In all the major hotels and water has not stopped at all, excavations are to Kamenica and there's a water mode.</comment>
    <comment category="negative" id="32140927">  To returnees from velingrad-these days the news had a story that there was a water mode Such things to learn when booking or by reading the advertising materials for the world SPA CAPITAL will not read and that the village was ploughed already do not know how many months. BUT you will learn that the prices are increased and charged dop″lnito for things because if you see any celebration and there are home losers but this is an old maxim While there are idiots and there will be smart</comment>

I was wrong and there really has another indoor pool?     Yes, there is a small indoor pool, but I personally don't like it and don't use it, because it is very dark and there's no air. I prefer the hot water in the open. </comment>
    <comment category="negative" id="32141313">After a week we go to Sveti spas, but I decided to look around and in the older themes for him and there is a review by 2012, the pool was dirty and the children's pool there was a rusty radiator. Is that really so? Here's a piece of their mind, whether it is still like this:-the children's playground there are 5 toys, figuratively speaking, and most of them are broken-and had lunch at the restaurant once, and me personally, I didn't like the food-domanitet in my salad were green and with handles, the meatballs uncooked-no outdoor pool, one of the pools is located under something like transparent canopy, I think hygiene around the pools was not of the level-there was a rusty radiators dirt on the floor, etc.-not enough lounge chairs outside. While we were there, there were no more than ten that were employed. Absolutely nonconformity with the capacity of the hotel-the air conditioner in our room didn't work. After we asked the front desk to look at him, a man came and said this is its capacity. We never got to cool down the room for the rest of our stay-the room itself wasn't anything special. It was rather narrow and carpet was very musty. On the balcony there was no dryer-Internet managed to catch or in the lobby or on the balcony. In the room there was definitely. It's not serious in 5 star hotel you want toilet paper from the front desk.  If it's all true, it's better not to go at all.</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32141606">A month ago, we were in St. Spas. Only bad impression on me did not podsušavaše around the swimming pools. For adults is difficult to walk, what remains for young children. Otherwise, the food and the cleanliness in the room was OK. Children's corner is now moved against the restaurant, there are a few entertaining toys for young children, the bigger draw. </comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32142486">Well, that it can by 2012 to five times are changed.  Not a bad hotel, the water is warm, the food is good, if it's not crowded and you are with good company will have a great time!</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32143701">Hi, if there is someone with recent experience with complex Berkut, because there's a theme of 2011, and don't find any recent posts for the same.   I ask the question, because we're going to pay him a visit in the next two weeks and want to know if it's worth it.   Thank You In Advance. </comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32145205"> Bled, thanks for the theme!      I can not boast low prices on hotels, so I will read more.    </comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32145730">And at the moment is disturbed, the main street and there are problems with the water. -mode., I'm more interested in Chepino and Kamenica. If someone could say I'd appreciate</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32149629">Very interesting suggestions. I already have located at least two hotels for spring break on the small ... We remotely plan:) I saw the topic that recommended k-with the island-basically it, we were fascinated by the food, but the Spa is lamentable, and hard water cool for young children. Outside the playground is near the swimming pool during the cooler months is empty and is quite dangerous for children. In a Word, the price and the stars do not meet the demand.  Another voice for the wild farm in Upper field-truly unique place, especially if you want to be close to nature and the children to be close to animals.  This summer we were in, Devin and Ismena summer SPA hotel is ideal especially for families with children. Green, stylish interior and exterior, with Bulgarian motifs, wonderful children's Center. Good restaurant, especially if you're more patient. This is not however for the winter-no hot Spa affair.  Calista Starozagorski baths Spa is really nice, warm mineral water, good service, nice and clean, gorgeous yard, in a Grove, but not with design-show that is reconstructed Socialist station.  AURA hotel in velingrad is also a favorite among some of the most opulent pools, although the hotel is relatively small. I think I have a doctor who recommended procedures. And for summer and for winter, except it's a little patio, but the Park is nearby. We haven't found the perfect hotel ....</comment>

    <comment category="positive" id="32150065">Velina in Chepino, you'd better call in the hotel, I think this neighborhood have water, but still ask.</comment>
    <comment category="negative" id="32150255">If someone was soon in Velina, let him write if there is a problem. Info from the hotel will not be very credible. I don't expect you to admit it before you pay. Does it matter that there and in the bathrooms there are mineral water, that is clearly not by conduit powered hotel, or imagining it?</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32157096">Very nice theme, thanks!  Will watch with interest.</comment>

    <comment category="positive" id="32182289">Hi girls. Two days ago we came back from Devin. I strongly recommend hotel Persenk. He's awesome! Great service, spa-zone is great, pool water around 30-32 degrees, in the children's pool and the hot tub even more hot. I have absolutely no comment.  Before we go in Devon we stayed for one night in Plovdiv. The hotel is a business hotel. Also recommend it. Cozy, modern, good service.</comment>
    <comment category="positive" id="32182340">  Can anyone recommend some good bungalows on the northern Black Sea coast. If you have a kitchen or kitchenette, nice beach and backyard for the kids, that'd be great. We already 10 days in Greece and now we are looking at the beginning of August to make another little more cheap holiday.  If my question is not in the correct theme, please direct me, I searched but not found. Thanks!   Bungalows Nimfa, Kamchia. They're awesome. </comment>

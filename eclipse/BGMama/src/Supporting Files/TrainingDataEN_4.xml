My husband and I had a room with a king bed and it was clean, quiet, and attractive. Our sons were in a room with twin beds. Their room was in the corner on the main street and they said it was a little noisier and the neon light shone in. But later hotels on the trip made them appreciate this one more. We loved the old wood center staircase. Breakfast was included and everyone was happy with waffles, toast, cereal, and an egg meal. Location was great. We could walk to shops and restaurants as well as transportation. Pike Market was a reasonable walk. We enjoyed the nearby Gold Rush Museum. Very, very happy with our stay. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126795011">Great visit to Seattle thanks to our stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square! The hotel was reasonably priced and close to everything we wanted to see - ferry ride, Underground Tour, Klondike Museum, short walk to Pike Market and other shopping. The staff was amazingly helpful and accommodating. Our room was very clean and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. Before we booked, I read about some potential issues with the area. I can honestly say that the area was just fine! In fact, if you enjoy historic and quaint parts of town, this is definitely where you want to stay. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone who is headed to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126715331">Great Location,short walk from Amtrak station, Link or to a game.

This hotel is very reasonably priced, located just off Pioneer Square, close to shops and restaurants and public transport (light rail). It appears to have recently been completely renovated in a period theme. Rooms are small but well equipped comfortable and clean - reminds me a little of a European style hotel. Staff are polite and helpful - in a genuine way. It is suitable for all types of stays business to a romantic getaway. Next time your in Seattle stay here!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126067021">Very cool old building in a great location. Check in went well (temp parking in front), parkade is about 1 block away. If you are there on a weekend, make sure you aren't getting screwed by the rates the hotel charges, compared to the parkade charges. Rooms are large. Non view rooms actually just look at a wall so might be bad if you are claustrophobic. DO NOT stay by the elevator. We were there mid afternoon and were given the room right behind the elevator when there were still lots of rooms left to book out. Even when the elevator didn't run, it banged constantly. We were able to move rooms the following day. It's an old building so the hallway floors creak. Also, we were there on a Sat. night and had young people partying around us. Sunday was much quieter. Breakfast was very good however the room was extremely small.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125893357">I purchased a 7 day advanced room (actually 2 months prior) and needed to cancel my trip.

If you are looking for a conveniently-located downtown hotel for a reasonable price, this hotel is for you. It is located within a couple blocks of the Bus tunnel which gets you downtown for free during the day and also provides a way to get to the airport. However, it is close enough to walk to the waterfront attractions, Pike Place Market, the ballpark, the stadium, and the center-city of Seattle. We did not get a rental car because of the location and availability of public transportation. The hotel is in a historic building. The rooms are quite nice and are not "cookie-cutter". There are not many amenities to the hotel itself, though there is a breakfast room and "free" Continental breakfast was included in our room rate. There is a pub next door (same building) as well as several other shops. A good Italian restaurant (Al Boccalino) is less than 100 feet away, and a variety of shops and restaurants or pubs are very close. The "Seattle Underground" tour is located nearby and a couple of ferries are within sight out the front door of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They greeted us as we walked by the front desk every time. We would like to get back to Seattle next year to see more sights and catch a ballgame. This hotel will be our first choice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124231798">Stayed two nights after AMTRAKing from LA. Walked from railway station to hotel. An old building refitted to be good lodging place. Refitting was installing bathroom in each room as an afterthought. Remaining space is small for higher class hotel. Simularly, the elevator column eats part of the original lobby space. The classy open stairway is still in service. Also, historic district sign code constricts the outdoor sign of the hotel to omit the words Best Western. beyond her oddities the place was just fine. Good beds, clean bathrooms, nice breakfast, WIFI, internet computers, competent staff, reasonable price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123915604">The Best Western Pioneer Square is a great hotel in an underrated part of downtown Seattle. The historic hotel has retained its historic atmosphere without sacrificing quality. My son and I stayed for 5 days here in January. Being off season, it may have problems (like noise) that we did not run into. The room was compact but very livable and very clean. Our room faced an internal courtyard and was very quiet, especially for a downtown hotel. The free breakfast was exceptional in my opinion; plenty of options with a helpful staff dedicated to the breakfast room. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. The location is a little ways from the financial/shopping part of downtown Seattle, but a rather easy walk. Pioneer Square has a lot of ambiance, and the waterfront and stadiums are very close by, along with public transportation (Amtrak, light rail to the airport). Lots of good restaurants and pubs within a block or two. This was one of those rare hotel experiences where I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. Just keep in mind that it's almost 100 years old and not a 5* luxury hotel, and you won't be disappointed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123521901">We loved the area where this old hotel is located. you have restaraunts and shops all around pioneer square, but they cater to the downtown area so they close early around 7pm. The room was large and the bed very comfortable and our room faced the street and it was very quiet. We enjoyed the small breakfast as we were looking for something to hold us over til we got to Pike's market. The staff was helpful and even though the parking is off sight it was not that inconvenient. You are allowed to park in front for 15 minutes to get your bags up to your room. We ate at the Italian eatery next door and found it romantic and good food but a little over priced and they will charge you for everything so be careful. You have to ask. The bread does not come with the meal!!! Overall we loved the place and will come back again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123449316">My husband and I had a trip to Seattle with our daughter, who had a job interview. We wanted to her to get a good tour of the city and neighborhoods, to see if she might enjoy living there--so it was a business and sightseeing trip. The Pioneer Square Best Western Plus was a great choice for us, located in the historic part of downtown. It was about 20 minutes from the airport, which was an easy drive (though the train from the airport is a great option if you don't need to drive). The hotel was close to a lot of attractions, the free city bus ran a block away from the door (straight up to Pike's Market) and there were lots of good restaurants near by (check out Delicatos for great deli sandwiches, Cherry Street Coffee Shop for a cup of home roasted brew and breakfast, and Elliott Bay Oyster House for great seafood, a view and great service!). We were upgraded to a large room with 2 queen beds, desk, and small sofa as a Best Western club member. The bottled water and chocolate chip cookies were appreciated. The beds were comfy and linens were nice, the bathroom spotless, the room a great size, free wireless, and the continental breakfast was a great bonus. I got a great price online, though had some trouble booking through Southwest (with our flight), so when I called the hotel directly, they honored the online price. The parking was $20/day, which is less than many area hotels and though it is up the street in a parking garage, you got a card that gave you access in and out, even when the garage was closed at night to the public. There is a small parking zone in front of the hotel for loading/unloading luggage. There was a small amount of street noise, but it didn't affect our sleep. The staff was friendly and right on with their restaurant suggestions. We also did a walking tour of Seattle (Seattle By Foot City Tour-$20/person 2 hr tour)--a fun, informative and easy paced tour of the highlights of downtown Seattle with a great guide--highly recommended! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back to Seattle soon!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123184136">My husband and I stayed at this hotel, and we recommend it to anyone travelling to Seattle for business or pleasure.

It was terrible starting with fighting traffic until a space was open in front of the hotel to park to check in. The parking garage was a nightmare with small twisting levels and cars traveling in both directions down the ramp. The room was very small and didn't have a desk or a place to work other than the bed. Very uncomfortable to use a laptop. Breakfast was very bare bones with mediocre coffee and reconstituted juice. All night the people above me were moving around and making enough noise to wake me. The staff was wonderful and the room was very clean.

The booking (on the road) and the check in upon arrival was excellent and the service outstanding. Having a large 3/4 ton van can have its challenges for parking, however the reception staff were very helpful in accomodating this requirement, even before I got there. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and decor. The location is great if you want to explore downtown Seattle and its historic section. Pikes market is a nice walk away and the 'free' tourist bus route is close at hand. The rail transit to/from Seatac is not too far away and is an economical way to travel this leg, if required.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121769680">I have stayed at many Best Westerns across 4 continents and have learned never to have very high hopes, but this one was a nice surprise. The check in was quick, with friendly polite service, and the room was very big with a very comfortable king size bed, and it looked immaculate. The bathroom is quite small however, and only has a shower, which is fine by me, although the shower can double as a shallow, small tub but for people who want a full size tub this would be a problem. As I said, the shower was fine for me, with brand name soaps etc., and nice big fluffy towels that also looked new. My only negative comment would be that I would have liked a choice of feather pillows, instead of synthetic, but maybe that's asking too much. I found the price to be excellent as well for a downtown hotel, and would definitely stay here again if I am in the area. A very pleasant stay, at a very pleasant hotel.

We chose this hotel because of it's location close to the Amtrak station and the positive reviews from trip Advisor. We stayed for 2 days in late October and loved the ambiance of the architecture and cozy comfort, and quiet of our spotlessly clean room. We had no view, but who cares, we were more interested in viewing Seattle by walking and Pioneer Square is perfect for it! This was also one of the most pleasant, and helpful front desk staffs we have ever dealt with. The breakfast was very good and they get extra stars for serving so early.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121068100">Don't judge a book by its cover. When I drove up to this hotel at night, I had second thoughts about making that reservation. It looked like a seedy hotel in a forgotten part of town. But step inside, and you'll find a quaint, well-decorated space with a friendly, attentive staff. Our room was clean and bright with large windows and high ceilings. The location is south of the busy downtown, but there are plenty of great eateries and interesting shops. It's just a couple of blocks from the waterfront. Pike Place Market is further away, but we walked there--the blocks are short. We parked our car in an off-site parking garage nearby and walked everywhere. It rained non-stop, but the hotel loaned us umbrellas. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

The staircase is something they are proud of and the panelled conference room with 24/7 use of two pc's. I brought over some pho from a restaurant across the street and the young fellow at reception was pleased to bring me a large bowl from the hotel to eat my pho. Nice touch, fellow.

Staff was very friendly and accommodating from the get-go. The hotel is situated just minutes from the piers, and in walking distance to the downtown core. No need to take a taxi, everything is really close. The room, although facing the water and a busy street, was quiet and clean! The bed was very comfortable and he bathroom had a great size.The breakfast was very good and open early, a good start to the day with lots of different choices. If there's one negative at all, it's the availability of parking, the hotel doesn't seem to have a parking lot, the public parking is available but very expensive (we paid $36) for one night. (although there might have been a surcharge because the Sounders had a game that night). Being located so close to the stadiums and downtown, this hotel will be my choice from now on for every trip to Seattle in the future! To all staff: Thank you very much for making us feel welcome! We'll be back!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119438901">We stayed at the Best Western Pioneer Square for two nights at the end of our Seattle trip (we stayed with friends for the first half). It was great! The room was big enough for the two of us, the bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom was clean and fairly spacious, as well as restocked each day. I liked the old charm of this historic building. The free breakfast was basic, but was plenty for us (cereal, fruit, and waffles, if you wanted). Since we did the Underground Tour on our first day in Seattle, we were acquainted with the Pioneer Square area, and getting around was not a problem. During our stay at the Best Western, we walked to Columbia Tower, Seattle Aquarium, and Pike Place. We managed to take the bus to the Space Needle without issue as well - the bus stop is a block away. We took a taxi back from the Space Needle ($8-9 with tip), and noticed the fare to SeaTac was $32. Instead, we took the light rail from the Pioneer Square Station to SeaTac, which is three blocks (albeit uphill) from the hotel for a cheeeeeeeap $2.75. Just be sure to allow 40 minutes or so for the ride if you choose the light rail. Also, if you're looking for a great sandwich, my husband and I highly recommend Delicatus, which is a block up from the hotel on 1st Ave. I am still fantasizing about their Pav Diablo sandwich, yum. If you sleep late or want a second breakfast, Planet Java is one block over from the hotel on South Washington - we had a decent brunch there, eggs, turkey sausage and waffles. Nothing extraordinary, but tasty and filling. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Excellent value, pleasant staff, very clean, great location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119331634">On a road trip from San Diego to Seattle, we found the best hotel last! Stayed here for two nights and would recommend it to anyone. The hotel itself is lovely and historic but updated in all the right places. The location can't be beat. It is a block from the piers for dinner and ferry rides and at the edge of the historic district for walking around old Seattle. The staff is very pleasant and uber helpful. Beds were comfy. We had a king at the front of the hotel overlooking Yesler. The room was small but the location and the price more than made up for it.

We enjoyed our stay and found the hotel very comfortable, convenient and the staff extremely helpful. I was originally worried about noise being downtown, however, room 419 on the front of the hotel, was an excellent choice and was quiet, extremely clean, well serviced and very comfortable. The continental breakfast included with the rate was good - cereals, boiled eggs, pastries, toast, jams, good coffee, juice and you could make a fresh waffle too - more than enough to get you going for a day. The underground tour runs from Pioneer Square a block away. It is a very interesting tour, lots of humour, worth doing. We liked being in the historic part of town - walked down First Avenue to Pike Market and the main town shopping centre. The train/light rail is only a few blocks walk from the hotel though, and you can catch this to the city or a suburban mall if you have time. We walked to the station with our luggage and caught the light rail to Seatac airport and at $2.75 a person this was a great value deal in saving on cab fare. The hotel overall and the great helpful staff exceeded our expectations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118292052">Very friendly and helpful staff, good complimentary breakfast. Rooms were decent-sized and comfortable. It looked like it was remodeled within the last 5 years. It is only 1.5 blocks from the Metro station, so it was convenient getting from and to Sea-Tac airport. It is located in the historic section of Seattle. The only negatives are that about 3 blocks away are the shelters and missions for the homeless. The walls of the hotel are a little thin; we didn't hear people talking, but did hear the plumbing whenever a nearby toilet was flushed or shower turned on. The hotel is about a block away from an elevated highway, so it was a little noisy during the weekday mornings. Otherwise, the hotel was a great place to stay and a pretty good value. Within walking distance to Pike's Market, Seattle Center (less than 2 mi), and Chinatown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118249428">We booked the 4 night package prior to joining a cruise, we had stayed in Seattle before in a hotel with a room that was no bigger than a shoe box. This was not the case with this hotel, the room was large, light and airy and the bathroom had a very unusual shower that also doubled as a bath. The first impression of the hotel was not that good, there is a lot of dark wood panelling in reception and the lighting is a bit gloomy, however check in was both speedy and friendly, with the welcome news that the hotel had free wifi. The breakfast which is included in the room rate is good, always great to make your own waffles. The down side of the breakfast room is that it can be a bit cramped when busy and I'm afraid some guests have been quite careless and spilled things on the floor and stained the carpet - it really could do with a good shampoo just to tidy it up. The hotel is in a perfect location, near to the water front, so handy for ferries. For a bargain rate of just $2.75 you can take the light railway from the airport and the walk the block and a half to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again, also plenty of good eating places in walking distance.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117813480">Great old hotel close to Pioneer Square.

Our room was spacious, very, very clean and the breakfast the next morning was Continental along with waffles. We walked to the Space Needle for dinner and rode public transportation back - really easy. The next morning, the Victoria Clipper, Pier 65, to Victoria was just 1 mile from the hotel.

The location is the best if wanting to walk Pier 57 or old Pioneer Square.

We were a group with four generations (Grandmother, my Inlaws, Dh/myself and our 1yr old DD). We took a shuttle from the airport but could have easily taken the light rail for $2.75 had we not had our 84 yo grandmother. The hotel was perfectly located to walk to lots of restaurants, bars, the Underground tour, Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle if you are adventurous, an easy 4 minute walk to the light rail, and best of all it's right on the water and easy to walk all the great seafood restaurants and the Pier. Every room was a little different, we had four and they were all shaped different with different coffee pots (in-laws had a Keurig, Grandmother had a balcony) and the morning breakfast was really nice, fresh waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, water, coffee and juice. I definitely plan to stay here for our next trip to Seattle (which will happen now that I fell in love with the city!)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115932875">We spent 3 days in Seattle in this hotel, walking distance to the Market, the ferries, and all the waterfront, very close to all transportation including to the airport.

Because it is on the courtesy bus route(during the day), you can avoid the hills to get to the Fish Market and other places within the city. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was nice. We enjoyed discovering another part of town after staying near the Space Needle before our cruise. The location of the Best Western hotel had some more grungy type bars, but we found some nicer restaurants. I couldn't imagine a couple over 60 or a familyenjoying its local very much.(Nearer the Spcae Needle seems better), but we found the area interesting and I enjoyed the underground tour which was minutes from the hotel, Most important-if you are able bodied-there is a metro for $2.00 to the airport with a stop 5 minutes walk away from the hotel(slighly uphill) that will save you a $50 limo ride!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115801249">We came in to town on the Sunday after a terrible trip up the I-5.

Great area very central. We were given tickets for free appy at an Irish Pub down the street. Took advantage of that and we were very happy with the food and Beer selection. The Pub was called Fado.

I found the hotel to be a very good combination of location, amenities and price. I arrived at the Sea-Tac airport and walked to the light rail station that is adjacent to the huge parking garage by Terminal D. After a 30 minute ride, I got off at the Pioneer Square station and walked the remaining 3 blocks to the hotel. Very cool. My single room was ready at 3pm as promised. Located on the 4th (top) floor, I discovered the room faced the adjacent double decked expressway that goes along the waterfront. However the double paned windows did an excellent job of keeping out the noise from the traffic. The room was good sized and more that sufficient for just me. The daily service to replenish the towels and make the bed was excellent and not obtrusive. The breakfast - included in the room cost - was extensive including just about everything except eggs and bacon. When I checked out, I simply walked to the light rail station (I got there at 6:45am - with no problems) and within 1.25 hours of walking out of the hotel, I was sitting in the departure lounge for my flight home. Again - the light rail worked like a charm. I found the location to be terrific. Pioneer Square is interesting and has a bunch of history. Or I walked down 1st street - past the Seattle Art Museum (OK but not great) - on to the Pike Street Market (about 15 minutes walk - and absolutely terrific) and all the great restaurants nearby. Alternatively I could walk 1 block to Alaskan Way - the street that borders the waterfront, - and sight see down the waterfront at all the seafood restaurants, cruise excursions and Seattle Aquarium (terrific) located on that street. As for the Pioneer Square neighborhood - I never felt uncomfortable during the day or night as I was wandering around. I paid for my stay in advance without the possibility of any refund. A gamble that worked out for me and got me an average daily room price of about $140. Free wi-fi is available and worked great. Bottom line: a very attractive combination of good hotel, great location, at a terrific price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR112804165">The hotel is a nice historical hotel in Pioneer Square neighborhood of Seattle. Room size was large and bed was comfortable. Continental breakfast had plenty of options and I loved the waffles. One minor qualm was the free wireless internet access available from the room was limited by number of connections, and 50% of the time I received "Number of connections already reached. Try again later." Since I was on vacation and need to spend less time online anyway, this was not a big deal to me. If you NEED internet, keep this in mind. Staff was friendly. I had read comments elsewhere about Pioneer Square being where the hoodlums hang out. Between the hotel and the downtown attractions, I did not notice this. Head toward the stadiums down Occidental and you may encounter several. Hotel was great for our vacation stay and the price was half of what I would have paid elsewhere downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR112730613">I forgot to add in our last review,and feel very important,that we took the light rail system from Sea-Tac airport for $2.50 a person within a couple easy walking blocks of the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel.

You are located in the free bus zone with a stop right outside the door. This bus will take you around all the greatest sites in the Pioneer Square area - including "the market". You will find yourself within walking distance of wonderful restaurants as well as activities like the Underground Tour. The Hotel has retained all of the good things from the past (10 foot ceilings and room layouts) and has upgraded where you want it to be ie the bathroom is totally modern as are the beds etc. The breakfast offered in the morning is very good also.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR110381164">My son and I spent 3 nights here to see the sights and take in some Mariner's games.

We used a city bus to get to the Air Museum and found the bus drivers very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with all our questions.

The rooms are indeed small, however they are furnished accordingly and they exude lots of charm. Our room was spiffy and clean. The TV is dated, however we didn't come here to watch television, so it was OK. We parkeed our full size pickup in the parkinf garage 2 blocks away, and this may sound inconvienent, it was not. The cost was 20 bucks a day, with in and out privelidges. We really liked the location, close to Pikes and the waterfront, and of course all the history of the area in general. The Under ground tour was close by, as was the public transportation system to get to the Monorail and Space Needle.

Both of rooms were well appointed and comfortable and service is very friendly. The rooms are very old-school, but it does add to the charm of the place. They serve a very good continental breakfast in the morning wit waffles, fruit, pastries, cereal, and bage. Location is excellent with the LINK train to the airport only a couple of blocks away and downtown within easy walking distance. One small service issue that I had, on 2 of the three mornings, I requested wake-up calls. I did not get the call the first morning and it was 1/2 late the second morning. I was in Seattle on leisure, and only had the calls so that I would not sleep the day away. Ultimately, not a big deal, but under different circumstances, it could have been a big issue.

When i arrived, i was warmly greeted by "Randy" who could not do enough to welcome me. He was so pleasant, it was a great first impression. I stayed on the 2nd Floor towards the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious and had all the amenities you would expect from a really good hotel, flat screen tv, iron, free wi-fi, coffee maker, desk and a very comfortable king bed. Maid service was good, and although i can be messy, the room was as good as new every time i came back after a day out around Seattle. The free continental breakfast was great also, and filled me up for the rest of the day. Particularly, the waffle making machine meant i could have a tasty hot waffle and maple syrup every morning, FAB. Location wise, you cannot get much better. It is close to funky jazz clubs, bars and restaurants. It is also really close to the waterfront and harbour cruises. There is also a bar next door and an Italian restaurant on the corner. It is also close to the baseball and football fields. I went to see the Seattle Mariners and had a great night with only a short walk back. Great hotel for the price.

Great place to see Seattle from.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR103380525">I had to stay in Seattle for a length of time. My father had been murdered and we had to go to trial. I stayed at this hotel for at least a total of 8 weeks between Nov 2010 through March of 2011. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and it's staff! Some of the rooms are a little small but this is a historical building. They do have larger rooms and they are great. I just wish they had a hot tub so I could relax after a long day at court! I loved the fact that each day I got a hello when I came in and a good luck when I left! They always made me feel like family! I must admit I love the fact that I get a knock on my door to find out if I need extra towels at the end of the day. Nice touch! The staff was always willing to help me! Never did I ever get anything but OUTSTANDING customer service. I am the owner of a small business and if I had staff like this my business would go crazy! I know all of the names of the front desk and each of them deserves a raise/bounes for all of the care and attention I and my family was given. A giant thank you to all of the staff form the front desk to the housekeeping! When we got the guilty verdict for the person that killed my father I could not wait to go back to the hotel and let them all know. It was like going home!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR102448656">I was on a "leisure trip" while my husband was on business. We specifically picked this property due to its proximity to Route 99--to get me where I wanted to go and to get him to his conference at Pier 66--and the perceived charm of the old Seattle area. But I won't say that it was a quick decision. Someone had posted a concern on this site about the homeless and noise of the area, which caused us to think long and hard before keeping this reservation out of safety concerns. We are both glad we stuck with it in the end and I'll explain more here if you wish to read it. First of all, we were right about the ease of getting around. Walking through Pioneer Square was a lot of fun. We found a great antiques shop, a diner with wonderfully fresh battered cod, and took the Underground Walking Tour. We used the Route 99 bus (temporary replacement for the Waterfront Trolley) repeatedly--to go shopping, to head to Chinatown, to go to the fish market, and to the waterfront. It stops right in right of the hotel for one direction, and within a short block walk for the other. Second, the customer service of this property was phenomenal. They were friendly and helpful in every way possible. If nothing else, that makes this property quite unique. Add that to the charm of the building and this was the nicest Best Western I've stayed in. Now, as to the homeless. Sad that there are people who have to live like that, and Seattle does seem to have their fair share. But contrary to what I had read, they are not dangerous, nor do they harass you on every corner. I think I saw maybe 3 or 4 actually begging to money in some way; the rest are just trying to get through life as pleasantly as possible. As to safety: While the latest we were out walking in the area was around 8:30 pm, I did not feel unsafe. I even ended up walking past the men's homeless shelter by myself one evening around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised to find that not a soul bothered me or even tried to approach me. As to the "noise", supposedly there is the traffic from the freeway on one side and bars on another. We requested a quiet room and was provided one on the interior of the hotel, so we heard none of that, if in fact it is as bad as someone writes. One more bonus--this hotel is less than 3 blocks from the entrance to the light rail/underground tunnel bus access. Straight to Macy's to shop on any bus in the free zone; and straight to SeaTac airport for only $2.50 per person on light rail.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR102162989">Location was great. Close to the light rail (taken from the airport). Many good ethnic restaurants in immediate area. Turning left from the front door, you are about 200 yards from the dock of one of the ferries. I asked for a quiet room, and my interior room was extremely quiet. Breakfast was well above-average, good coffee, hard boiled eggs, cereal, etc. Thank you. Oh, the feel of Yesler Way neighborhood did not bother me. It originally was the "skid row" (logging) and is quite worn.

This hotel fit the bill perfectly, and at $88 per night through dhr.com the price was fantastic compared to other options. The building is older, but has been splendidly updated and we wanted for nothing. Breakfast was perfectly acceptable and included; only gourmet snobs and greedy gluttons could complain! Parking is limited and the garage is a block away, but the system works very well. If there are no more parking spots left, there is an open lot across the street at $13 overnight. Pioneer Square is ever so slightly rough around the edges, but we felt perfectly safe.

It overlooked a tiny courtyard so there was no view but at least there was no street noise whatsoever. The bed was comfortable and it was great to have free local calls and free internet (not wireless). The free continental breakfast was very nice and the front desk staff were very professional. I opted to stay here because of the above and their no pets and no smoking policies. The only negative point I have is that the only heat source in the room was a very noisy window mounted fan. I had to turn it off during the night as there is no way I would have been able to sleep with it on. Do not be put off staying here because of the location. I felt safer in Pioneer Square than parts of downtown (2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th Ave street corners for example). I would not have a problem staying here again but think I'll opt for somewhere a bit more modern.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR98149970">The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. The room was clean, decorated in a style fitting with historic restoration but not too fussy. Location was fabulous for us - it was sunny the 2 days we were in Seattle and we walked everywhere we needed to go: Pike's Place Market, ferry to Bainbridge Island, wonderful food just around the corner. We could have taken the bus in the downtown "free zone" to any of those places had it been raining. The light rail station was less than 2 blocks - so fare to the city from SeaTac was $2.50 per person each way. First night there was someone talking in the hall (near our room) as soon as we called the front desk someone came and asked him to move - which he did. Weather was cold and halls were kept cool, but our room was toasty warm. We're looking forward to staying there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR97977252">Stayed here based on TripAdvisor comments, which were mostly right-on. The most significant for us were: 1) Location within walking distance of the Amtrak King St. Station, Pioneer Square, and the free bus line (#99) which accesses everything from Belltown to Chinatown. Ferry terminal and stadiums are also nearby. 2) A room that was large, quiet, and very clean. We asked for and were given a quiet, interior room. Many exterior rooms face the Highway 99 Viaduct or the street, so they are probably a bit noisy. 3) Staff that was helpful and friendly, with no exceptions. 4) A fair price. In summary: A great place to enjoy the city without a car.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR94272704">The Best Western Pioneer Square is a rather old building that shows some signs of its age on the exterior, and it has a couple of rather gloomy-looking alleyways beside it, but don't let any of that put you off. The inside has been 100% rennovated, and is more than adequate for a hotel stay. The room rates are much lower than some of the larger hotels just a few blocks away, and the furnishings and staff were quite good. The room had fixtures that looked brand new, and the bathroom and furniture were very clean and comfortable. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful with every request. The hotel may not have had a large number of guests during the time of my stay, but whether that was the reason or not, it was one of the quietest rooms ever experienced in a hotel. Made for a very good night's sleep.I would have no hesitation about staying there again, and the lower price is just an added incentive.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR93896196">This was our first trip to Seattle and we were amazed at how nice and attentive the staff was at this hotel. Everyone was very friendly. We arrived early, so our room was not ready, but the staff checked us in and stored our bags for us. They gave us maps of Seattle and showed us how to get to Pike Place. They invited us to have some complementary breakfast too. Its a quick walk to Pike Place Market from the Hotel. After walking around, we headed back to the hotel with our room ready and were very happy with the size and cleanliness of the room. Our flight was very early morning and the staff on duty even made the effort to get us some breakfast even though they were not open yet. They also arranged our transportation to the Airport.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR93268383">We booked on their website, the least expensive room with two twin beds, but this may not exist, because we were upgraded when we arrived to two doubles. Chose the hotel for its location near the Art Museum and Pikeâ€™s Market (6-8 blocks). Overall, itâ€™s nicely decorated in keeping with the historic neighborhood, but our room was very small. Not enough floor space to even put up the luggage rack or ironing board. The furniture was decent quality, if a bit too large for the space. The bathroom counter was 3/4ths occupied by coffee maker, ice bucket and glasses. Our room card key was temperamental, and changing keys didnâ€™t help. A phone in the hallway to contact the front desk was inoperative. We slept very well, no noise from other guests, and the raised highway nearby sounded like ocean surf, not disturbing. The continental breakfast is very generous, with an excellent waffle maker. The free parking garage, however, is treacherous, with lanes so narrow that turning its blind corners could mean running head-on into a car in the opposite direction. Descending on one corner I had to pull to the side, stop, then back up to return to the lane in order to avoid a collision. If youâ€™ve got a larger car, park somewhere else! Spaces are first-come-first-serve anyway, and we went up 5 floors before finding a spot. The historic neighborhood felt safe, although since it was cold weather there may have been fewer street people around. If youâ€™re willing to put up with a few quirks in an older building, this is a good location for seeing downtown Seattle. You donâ€™t need to walk steeply uphill to access the market and shops overlooking the waterfront.

While parking is not onsite; there is parking located in a parking garage about 2 blocks away at $20 per night. We did find that the hotel's location was such we were able to walk to the museum...about 3 or 4 blocks away. The hotel is also located within the "free bus" section of the city so that if we had wanted to go to any of the many attractions that downtown Seattle has to offer, it would have been very easy for us to do so. The waterfront is also within walking distance...about a block away. The hotel is a small, boutique style hotel and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The king bed was very comfortable and while our room was on the small side, our friends' room across the hall was much larger although their room had a very odd-sized square tub that was quite awkward while the tub in our room was "normal" sized. Diversity in rooms, I guess you could say. The hotel provides a complimentary breakfast with waffle machine, yogurt, various cereals and fruits, etc. The hotel does not have an in-house fitness center but daily passes for the Xplore Fitness Club are available at the front desk for a per day fee. Located just a couple of blocks from the hotel, it comes complete with all the up-to-date weight, free motion equipment and over 20 different kinds of cardio machines. This wasn't an amenity that we took advantage of so can't speak to it. While there isn't an in-house restaurant, there is a restaurant next door to the hotel which will provide limited room service should you wish it. We appreciated the free high speed internet as well as the free local phone calls. This was a hotel where we did NOT feel they were out to gouge us for every cent possible unlike other higher-priced hotels we have stayed at. The staff of the hotel were all outstanding! They all were very friendly and helpful and went beyond our expectations. They all seemed very sincere in their desire to ensure any of our questions were more than adequately answered. I can't remember any recent stay in any hotel where I was so impressed with everyone on the staff of the hotel as I was with the staff of the Pioneer Square Best Western! The hotel was very quiet until about 5 am when the garbage trucks began their pick-up. I was having trouble sleeping so found the noise disconcerting. However, our friends were sleeping soundly and the trucks did not disturb them. This, of course, is not an issue within the hotel's control. Other than this, there did not seem to be any street noise during the night.

It's right across the street from the Seattle Underground tour (recommended!) and near restaurants and other amenities. This is a a small, old character hotel though, so you have to be prepared for what comes with that - a slow elevator, no fitness room or pool, no onsite dining other than the breakfast bar, minimal meeting or business facilities. This is not hotel to stay at on business or bring small children to. It reminds me of similar boutique hotels in San Francisco's Union Square, but quieter at night and with fewer other attractions nearby. The front desk staff at the B/W Pioneer Square are top notch. Very friendly and accommodating. Returning there after a day of knocking around, you really felt like you were coming home. The staff next door at the breakfast bar were less warm, but not obnoxiously so. The quest rooms are larger than you'd think in such an old property. This generosity of proportion does not extend to the bathrooms however, which are quite dinky. The room decor is in definite need of updating - you have mismatched bed and window coverings, both of which appear to date from the 80's, on top of old carpet. Our room was quite long, with perhaps eight feet of empty floor between the bed and and armoire in which perched a 26" CRT television. You practically needed opera glasses to watch it. Updating the rooms and in-room amenities would greatly improve the property. These are minor complaints, and on the whole we really enjoyed our stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR84843008">We checked in on a busy Sunday; NFL football was about to kick off and the hotel had been full the night before. We were assured our room by 3 PM and true to their word, our deluxe room was a pleasant surprise. For an old hotel, the room was better than expected. It was large and brightly appointed with clean, modern carpeting and nice furniture. The beds were comfortable and the lighting good. The bathroom is stocked with high end Neutrogena toiletries. The TV is old and the picture a tad fuzzy. Letâ€™s hope new flat screens are on the way. Parking is at the Butler Garage, a 12 story parkade located a block and a half from the hotel. Not bad considering the age and location of the hotel. Our room was quiet, even though it faced the main street. We slept well. If you have many electronic gadgets which may need charging, bring a power bar as electrical outlets are scarce. Other TripAdvisor reviews of poor internet service proved true. It was intermittent at best. We called the 1-800 service and received little help. We were on vacation, so not such a big deal but a business traveller may not share our sense of charity. The gentleman who checked us out was genuinely concerned and promised to follow up with their provider. The breakfast room has about 12 small clothed tables and the food is excellent.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR83255269">We loved the old heritage style of the hotel. The rooms were big and comfortable.(Despite the pink bedspread and floral curtains!)The front desk staff were knowledgeable and friendly. The only negative was the breakfast staff, the two women appeared bored and disinterested and acted as if we were an infringement on their day. We enjoyed our stay and would return again. We also dined at the Italian restaurant right next door and enjoyed the atmosphere, service and authentic style food.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81984198">This hotel reminded me of the elegant Fairmont heritage hotel in Victoria, BC only with a French balcony.While the outside looks turn of the century the interior is immaculate with all the modern convieniences including a massage shower. Unfortunately no pool or jacuzzi. Free continental cold breakfast where I made myself hot waffles. We asked for a fridge and one was delivered to our room in minutes. There is a grocery store 2 blocks from the hotel and a Market Place IGA 2 blocks from Pikes' Place. Next door is a spa/salon in case your feet need pampering after walking 3 blocks to Pike's Place where yes, they acutally do throw fish and sells Market Spice tea. There are 3 floors of boutiques beneath the food sellers. It's 2 block to the Art Museum. If you haven't been to Seattle take the underground tour located across the street and have fun while you learn the history of Seattle. We walked 1 block from the hotel down to Alaska way, the street that stretched accross the waterfront (Pier 50) and walked to Ivar's where the best (white) clam chowder in the world is served. Try the fish and chips with a cup of clam chower both use the same receipe from 1938 when the restaurant opened. The hotel provides maps This hotel is located in the "free bus" area.The next day we took the bus outside the hotel door and after a tour of the International District headed down Alaska way to to pier 91 where our Holland America ship awaited. I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81757663">This hotel is not going to impress you if you only stay at 5-star hotels, but it is very clean, and the staff work hard to give you a great experience. The complimentary breakfast is quite good, and the location makes most of downtown very convenient for walking or riding public transit. If you absolutely must have wi-fi in your room, you might want to consider elsewhere. I was never able to use the Internet on any device from my room, and others I spoke to had the same experience.

We found the hotel to be an older style hotel, but to be expected as it had been around longer than anyone who knows how to use a computer and is reading this! The hotel was clean inisde however... our room was almost flawless. Room was a simple king bed room. Very clean, the TV worked and had good color. Shower, toilet and sink were all clean, as well the wi-fi worked great, so I wrote many reviews on local sight's from there in the late evening! The area around the hotel is quite nice, even during the night. The earlier reviews said it was 'sketchy'. I did not find this, however my partner did. I don't think women would be in danger in this area at night however, as the vagrants of the area seem to be quite pleasant, and ask for change sometimes, but always quietly, not agressively. Underground tour is within a stones throw, as well as a starbucks not even a block away and many restaurants in the area. Hope this helps you, and enjoy!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR79833598">We booked on the Internet for a queen small room and by morning we found the room was much too small...so I talked to the desk and they upgraded us to a wonderful larger room with a small iron patio...it was great. The building retains it's old character but provides modern comfort. The staff are fantastic. The location is a stones throw from the Underground tour in Pioneer square and an wasy walk to Pikes Market and other attractions. There are many great eating spots nearby including a very good Italian restaurant right next door. The breakfast was very good with a great view of the street outside. Overall it reminded me of my stay in the Best Western Eiffel Tower in Paris. The parking is a block up the street and secure but be prepared to pay $20 per 24 hr period.

Staff was knowledgeable, upbeat and accommodating. Room was unusually shaped, but space was adequate, and I liked the quaint feeling. The breakfast included was usual for this chain, so the only complaint I had was that the room was somewhat crowded, but the staff attempted to make up for this by clearing tables quickly and helping where they could. Would stay there again for business or leisure travel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR78701993">The Best Western at Pioneer Square was a real treat for us staying before and after an Alaskan cruise. I made the reservation well in advance and paid for the room rentals in adnvance before cruise and after cruise stays. Since the ship arrived back in Seattle very early I contacted the hotel to see if they would store our luggage until our room became available. Michael K. responded promptly and upon arrival back into Seattle he made arrangements to have our luggage stored until our room was ready. The hotel itself is classic history. It is centrally located and found that check-in was very smooth and the rooms very well maintained. Large room with excellent bath, and just the right amount of furniture. We felt like we were back in the 50 or 60's. The room was spotless and very clean, as well as the bath. We were placed on the 4th floor for the arrival stay and the 2nd floor for the return cruise stay. After checkin on the return stay with in 30 minutes, housekeeping was knocking at the door to make sure we were happy with the room and asked if we needed anything or more towels. That was Ezekial. The rooms offer only a window air conditioner unit for cooling but it served the purpose well. The hotel offers a breakfast inclusive of the room rental fee and that was in a separate area of the hotel. There were lots of choices, just not hot meals, except the fresh waffles that the patrons can make themselves. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but many choices near by. We ate at an Asian restaurant right next door to the Hotel ....Julie's Garden, small quaint, and excellent asian food at such a reasonable price. For a drink near the hotel just next door, try thePioneer Square Saloon. The hotel offers free internet service in their boardroom. Their is a printer so you can print your airline boarding passes if you like. There is free bus service during the daytime hours which we used with helpful directions from Michael the front desk clerk. We used the Seattle Light Rail from the airport for just $2.50 each way per person saving lots of $$ vs.taxi or shuttle service into Seattle. $2.50 each vs. taxi of nearly $45.000 each way. It was so easy to use. Went to the American Idol 2010 Tour at Key Arena the night before the cruise using the free city bus serivce, then caught the monorail and light rail back to the hotel after the concert. The hotel is just 3 blocks from the light rail station, an easy walk. Upon arrival back from the cruise we took a taxi from Pier 66 to the hotel for a $6.00 for 2 people to transport our luggage. That afternoon we went to Safeco Field for a ML baseball game Mariner's vs Twins, and just walked down the street to the ballpark. Both Qwest Field ...Seattle Seahawks and Safeco Field ...Mariner's baseball are within walking distance. Also the waterfront and seafood restaurants just blocks away for foot traffic. Ate dinner the last night at the CrabPot on the waterfront (Alaskan Way) which was in our opinion .....very overrated. We enjoyed a free bus ride to Pike Street Market Saturday morning before the ballgame which is really something to see. Room price was an average of $200.00 per night.... a bit pricey for us, but well worth it in the end, considering we saved lots of $$$ for inner city transportation and transportation via taxi, shuttle or cruise ship bus to the pier. Yes, I would recommend the Best Western Pionner Square for either business of leisure visits. Lots to do in Seattle, and a very friendly city. Only concern and negative was the massive amount of homeless and transient people in the city. Feel this is a very bad image for the City of Seattle, and city fathers should certainly try to clean this problem up. For an historic hotel, close to many venues, consider the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel. Friendly staff that is very helpful. You will not be disappointed. If we ever do another cruise from Seattle, we will consider staying here again. It was a real treat and a step back in time, since it is an historical hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR78697533">I recently stayed here for 1 night over the September Long Weekend. This is possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. It is grungy, doesn't smell nice, in a terrible location - its next to a bad area (my gf was yelled at twice by bums on the street coming out of the hotel); the service staff (particularily the Manager) is rude, and tried to overcharge us when we went to leave - we had booked for 3 nights then want to check out after one night given the conditions (our opinion). For Less than what this place costs you can go down the street to near Safeco field (hotel will be obvious) and stay in a beautiful new, modern hotel with a pool, hotub and beautiful rooms, also a safer location. We thought we were getting a good room as Best Western is typically a safe bet - we recently stayed in their New York location which was pretty good. Even if they didn't overcharge me by $61, I would think it is only fair to let other travellers know about this place. Avoid if possible. One positive - it has a waffle iron, which isnt terrible.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR78250190">Hotel is 100 years old, small, friendly, wonderful, great location with exceptionally nice staff --total atmosphere makes one feel at home.

Oh - and the elevator is extremely slow. The hotel provides a free breakfast but after the first day of trying the continental breakfast we decided to skip it the rest of the trip. It was difficult navigating to get our breakfast in a little space with many people. The breakfast was standard continental fare. The hotel is about 7 blocks from Pike Place Market and downtown.

The gentleman on the front desk greeted us with a smile, and informed us that he had upgraded us to one of the beautiful rooms on the 4th floor of the hotel. This was a very pleasant surprise, and very much appreciated. Our room overlooked a quiet street, by way of 4 huge double windows along one wall. The furnishings were top quality, including a three seater plush velvet lounge plus a single period style tapestried chair. Our bed was huge and comfortable, with bedside tables and lamps on either side. Plenty of storage space could be found in the large wardrobe and chest of drawers, and a large screen TV was enclosed in a wall unit. The light fittings were of the federation era, in beautiful cream coloured leadlight, with not only wall fixtures but also free standing lamps at either end of the room. In an alcove at one end was a round table with two twisted timber chairs, and as well there was a desk by the wall for workspace. The bathroom was also federation style with beautiful fittings, a large mirror, excellent water pressure from the shower which was housed in a large bathtub. The airconditioning was perfect and could be manually controlled by the guests in the room, and the large windows also opened, if you prefer fresh air from the bay. The room itself had 10 foot ceilings and all trimmings were of top quality red timber, with carpet throughout and tiles in the bathroom. The housekeeping staff were so quiet and unobtrusive that we didn't know they were around unless we saw them in the corridors. We had a nice continental breakfast each morning, which included all kinds of small pastries, fresh fruit, cereals, toasts and various breads, waffles which can be made by guests in the waffle maker, plus a variety of coffee and large assortment of teas. The dining room staff kept the tables cleared, the coffee urns full, and were obliging to any guests requirements. Our concierge organised taxies for us with ease, and was helpful with advice about the general area and any queries we had about restaurants or getting around Seattle. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants trouble-free accommodation within a nice environment where I believe the needs of even a demanding guest would be satisfied.

A few panhandlers, but relatively few for such a funky neighborhood. If you're trying to get in by car, the front desk guys do not drive into work and their well-meaning helpfulness was more hassle than help. You don't need a car here.

We were close to everything we wanted to see and were able to walk everywhere. Their parking lot (we were told) was a block and a half away. Well really it was just a 2 min walk and a lot closer than we imagined. The "blocks" were not "true" blocks. The garage was completely secure with a gate that closed at night, so only people with a pass could have access. We felt very comfortable leaving our car there. Yes, the area had some homeless around, but we were never bothered by them and felt completely safe at night. There was even a Starbucks 20 feet away for our morning latte! We went on the underground tour which was awesome and where we had to meet was only about 25 steps away. Soooo close. Lots of restaurants near by. We walked to the piers easily and went to Pike Place Market. The market was about a 15 minute walk. No big deal. Walking there we got to see all the old historic buildings along the way.

Also on the last night of our stay, my father got propositioned by a homeless woman on his way back from the parking garage alone. The bell men at the hotel were very friendly, and the rooms were clean. Breakfast was average, and nothing to write home about. Then again though, it was free.

Old brick building, small lobby, nice with fireplace, palms and a couple of chairs, nothing spectacular but it filled the needs of a lobby. You can imagine my surprise when we opened the door to our room and it was SPECTACULAR! Gorgeous furnishings, tri ceiling, lovely view of the quiet tree lined street below, tons of period furniture including a long couch and lovely desk, and the biggest bed I have ever seen (I sleep on a California King, at home). I can hardly wait to return!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR42810460">Location was central to places I wanted to see. Stayed 2 nights - room was small but comfortable and clean for the price charged. Staff member Mike was knowledgeable and helpful. Complimentary breakfast offered was much better than other same category chain hotels. Only downside to my stay was that the room window faced the side alley, with loud noises late at night that sounded like a garbage dumpster was being emptied.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR40155734">I would not stay here again, nor recommend it. Where to startâ€¦ Well, Iâ€™ll admit it was our fault to reserve so last minute on a busy weekend, but the rate of $200 tax for the first night compared to $95 the next night almost seemed criminal. The value was simply horrible. Iâ€™m kicking myself now for paying so much for a room that was clearly no better than one at Motel 6. And if the cost wasnâ€™t bad enough, upon arrival we were informed it was also the smallest room in the entire hotel, something they did NOT mention over the phone. When I expressed displeasure, I was offered no recourse, no discount, nothing. The $20/night parking fee was also an unpleasant surprise. Also upon arrival, the initial welcome left a rude, very negative feeling in general. We are a younger couple, and as such, it felt we were treated in a condescending manner. For example, the parking garage key â€“ I was told â€œItâ€™s worth $50 to us, so itâ€™s worth $50 to you, lose it and it will be charged to your credit cardâ€�. Not friendly or welcoming at all. Once we made it to the room, we realized just how small it was. There was about one foot of clearance all around the bed, and barely enough room for luggage. Oh, and lets not forget the spectacular view of a brick wall outside. $200/night for this? Never again. We settled for it anyways due to a long day of driving and just generally being too tired to make an issue of it. Amenitiesâ€¦ All your Best Western standards were there. The complimentary breakfast was your usual bagels, etc. The wireless internet though, was extremely slow and almost unusable. Overall, this is an old hotel albeit well maintained, but in a less desirable area of downtown Seattle (everything is uphill walking from this hotel). Itâ€™s a fair distance from any attractions, and also right next to a major viaduct, so I assume some rooms are likely quite noisy. $95/night (peak) sounds acceptable, anything more and youâ€™re paying far too much. I expected better from a Best Western.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR39961071">Where here now on the 2nd of 3 nights. The hotel is clean with a very nice breakfast, and location is excellent - one short block to the Underground Tours; across the street from the ferry's (take the Bainbridge Island ferry for a beautiful, very inexpensive trip to the Island - or another); about 8 blocks (nice walk) to Pike Place Market; a couple blocks to Elliott Bay shops. Everything is close and if you enjoy to walk just a little it's the perfect location and a great value. We love to find good value and boutique type hotels, especially in great locations. We highly recommend this. The only issue I have is our room is near the elevated highway and there is more noise at night than I care for (but ear plugs do the trick).

This was certainly true here, and a great find! Pioneer Square is more-or-less the heart of what's happening in Seattle, right in the middle of or within easy walking distance of an endless array of sights and shopping. A great, attractive, comfortable, clean room and bathroom, and even fresh apples waiting in the room. My location request had been incorporated with no difficulty. Because of a harried exit from home, I had forgotten to pack my very necessary hair spray in my checked luggage, and I forgot toothpaste as well. Due to airline difficulties, I arrived too late to buy these items. When I asked for toothpaste, they had it, which was not surprising. But I then said, jokingly, "I don't suppose you have any hair spray back there, do you?" And the young man said, "I don't know. I'll look." He opened the cabinet door behind him, and there was a short row of little hair spray bottles! ! ! Doing the happy dance, for sure! There is a restaurant next door which serves lunch and dinner - - and I think they deliver as "room service" until 10:00 p.m. Did not use that service. Free breakfast is available in the hotel breakfast room, with a nice selection of "continental" items - - plus do-it-yourself waffles! When I go back, I'll go down for breakfast a little earlier, so as not to get stuck in the "waffle line." Apparently we all thought everyone else would be eating early, but there was a late rush just before the serving stopped. Everyone still got everything they wanted, but we had to take turns! ! ! (The second morning we were catching the train to Vancouver, and ate breakfast on the train.) Look at the hotel website, and you will see this thoroughly updated hotel in a great location, with really nice people operating it. My traveling companion met me there the second night, and we were both very pleased with this choice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR36099530">This hotel is a big disappointment. While the staff is nice, our room has an intense moldy smell, lots of traffic noise, and lots of street lighting slipping through the curtains at night. This part of Seattle is very "seedy" as well. The smell of urine is very strong along practically every street and alley. The room is also small. I would recommend staying away from this place!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR35698438">As we parked our car in the unloading zone in front of the hotel, I was grew concerned. Walking into the hotel and then seeing our room I realized we'd be just fine. This is a terrific older hotel that is located in the old original downtown area of Seattle; an area that the city could do a lot more to improve. We were staying 3 nights and were informed our room had been upgraded. We were on the 4th floor with a small balcony. The room had double-paned glass which kept out most of the street noise, but if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs. I didn't need them. Our room was very clean, updated inside, and pleasant and the whole hotel is non-smoking which is an absolute joy. The Underground Tour (which I recommend) is only a block away. What this means, however, with at least 2 homeless missions within blocks away, is that the homeless congregate in that area as there are a multitude of tourists who come to see the old buildings and take the tour. I never felt endanged by any of them as we tromped back and forth, however, you have to ignor the requests for money. The parking structure suggested by the hotel seems much more secure than other parking nearby. You can park elsewhere if you want. The parking rate is a flat fee and you can come and go as much as you want/need. There is a city bus that stops right in front of the hotel that will take you over to the International District (which has an amazing store with all things Asian and many Asian fast food stands within). We were able to use buses in the "free zone" to get to almost everywhere we wanted to go for free. It was impossible to try and park near Pike Place Market, so the buses were very helpful--although you must walk several blocks from the free bus dropoff point. Also the free buses along the front shoreline road stop right in front of the hotel. The breakfast was okay. Yogurt and hard boiled eggs for protein and bagels/cream cheese and make-it-yourself waffles provide the carbs. There is a Starbucks a block away and several small restaurants in the immediate area. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel as it is a great value for the money. My only complaint is the one elevator. Unlike where I live, there is nothing that states when it was last inspected inside the elevator itself and it had a bounciness to it that made us feel a bit wary. That said, however, it worked and it would not deter a recommendation or future stay. I gave a 3/5 for location because the location has both pluses and minuses. I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24810622">Not sure how hotels are rated but i've stayed at ones in the 2 star rating that are much nicer than this one!!!Place is clean, but the beds are the worst.......bed are from a 1 start type hotel, nice pillows however......There are a large number of homeless panhandling in the area and you can't do the 1.5 block walk from parking without getting hit up...pretty rough neighborhood and seems to be getting worse..

Also a good location for exploring Seattle. It's easy to get to Pike Place Market Place, restaurants and downtown locations on foot or by bus. Pioneer Square is worth exploring and has a great bookstore, the Elliot Bay Book Company. What we didn't know before we got there is that there is an elevated freeway that runs above the part of the waterfront that is immediately west of the hotel. That area of the waterfront is, as a consequence, very noisy and not very attractive. We were there in July and it was hot enough that we needed the air conditioning provided by the room's older window unit. Thankfully, the air conditioner blocked the freeway noise. I wouldn't stay there at other times of year with nothing to block the noise. Since other reviewers describe their rooms as quiet, maybe there are quieter rooms further down Yesler street from the freeway. Or maybe some people are better at tuning out that kind of noise. Aside from the noisy location, this hotel was fine; clean, comfortable enough, reasonably priced when compared to other hotels further north. Breakfast was fine though nothing memorable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR22725550">As a Travel Agent, I've stayed at quite a few hotel, but this is the only Historic hotel so far... &amp; I loved it!

Also, the King Co. courthouse is not far, and there are a lot of people who hang out around there and around this whole area who are not the greatest. There are some nice tourist destinations near this hotel, but you're much better off staying nearer the convention center and only visiting the Pioneer Square area in daylight if there are specific things there you want to see. Near the convention center puts you closer to other places in the downtown area like the Pike St. Market.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10697853">My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this small, and historic hotel before our South Pacific cruise. Every thing was fine for us, excellent quality-price: - walking distance to most of the best attractions such as Pioneer Square (historical square, but a bit spooky day &amp; night), Pike Place Market (so lively, we met Rachel, the pig, and many many other Rachel all over the center... cute!), the Waterfront, the Business District, etc. - free bus to the other main attractions - free wireless Internet in our room (we highly appreciated!) - very courteous, and helpful personnel - free &amp; light breakfast, very practical. The room was comfortable, big enough for 2 persons, tastefully decorated but not well organized (nice but too big furniture), especially the bathroom as someone else mentioned. Before checking at the hotel, we visited the University District, which is far from the center but worthwhile to visit by car (we came from Vancouver with a rented car - a 3 h drive). Immediately after checking (our room was not ready), we returned our car. The rented car office was, again, within walking distance from the hotel. We were glad to have done that because although the Hotel offers parking spaces, they were far from the hotel, and expensive, and we do not need a car to visit Seattle. Public transport seems very well organized at least during the week. Seattle is a pleasant city, easy to visit; people were really nice and helpful with us, tourists (as in Vancouver by the way). Terminal 30, where our ship, Sun Princess, docked was close (a short taxi drive), not far from the stadium. But do not think about walking there: it seems to me a labyrinth of highways... I would certainly return to this hotel, and recommend it, if it is less expensive than big hotels nearby, which in our case were anyway all full.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7626327">We stayed at this Hotel while in Seattle on Business.

High ceilings and warm appointments, room quality is excellent and spacious, particularly considering the architectural restrictions of an older building. Use the tiny elevators, or what the heck... climb the wide staircases... it's good for your heart. Step outside into the fun of day or night life in Seattle. You are one block from the waterfront and trolley, and one block from tons of buses. On the opposite end of town from the Space Needle, there are loads of stores, shops and eateries nearby. Bring comfy walking shoes. Down an alley next to the hotel, i.e., one block directly behind the hotel is a wonderful diner, complete with quaint vinyl booths, where you can get a tasty, filling and affordable breakfast. Get a good rate, and this hotel is a sure winner.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7375345">Stayed at this place because I had a business meeting in downtown Seattle. This hotel is right in Downtown seattle but is in the Pioneer square area. To me, this area was pretty bad and I would walk around there alone (I am a woman). I would not feel safe there. Anyway, the hotel is pretty nice and the customer service is first rate. The room was very large but the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Great pillows but my body ached from sleeping in the very hard bed. The shower was the best part! Big and plenty of hot water!! I loved that part! Luckily I didn't have to pay for the room but it was pretty expensive - not worth the money to me.

We had noticed what appeared to be vagrants sitting in the unattended lobby a couple of times, including the early morning were checking out. My wife left our bags for a moment to get a muffin at the continental breakfast and when she came back to the bags, her handbag was gone, and so was the fellow who was sitting across from her. I was at the counter checking out and didn't see anything, but I did see the suspicious fellow sitting in the lobby as I move our bags. The manager was not there, as it was a Sunday, and they have treated us like we're trying to pull a scam. They claim no liability for baggage untended, but they should at least take responsibility for making sure their lobby is clear of derelicts waiting to prey on their customers. From about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. there is supposed to be someone at the front door, but outside those hours they have nobody there, and the clerks are unable to see who is coming in or leaving. The manager says they have security cameras, but I think she was bluffing to see if I backed off of our claims. None of the other employees there that morning knew of any cameras. Furthermore, the manager NEVER returned any of my calls as promised. We feel we've been treated disrespectfully, and none of our suggestions have been taken seriously (ie the need for full-time front-door concierge/security).

This time, we were not as impressed. The service was still excellent. And they have complimentary wine in the lobby for an hour each evening. That was nice! And the location is great -- walking distance to Pike's Market and lots of shopping. One of the first things I noticed when we got to our room was that the upholstered chair next to the bed was in tatters. No kidding. In at least four places it was not just threadbare, but literally torn down to the stuffing. For a hotel of this quality, this is completely unacceptable. Perhaps one of their doggie-guests been chewing on the chair. That's another thing. We didn't realize it was a pet-friendly hotel. I don't know if that's a new thing, but my husband never saw any pets there the first time around. Maybe because it was during the week, and this time we were there on a weekend. I'm fond enough of dogs, but I don't really want them staying in the hotel rooms that I stay in. However, it's my fault for not noticing the pet-friendly tags on their website beforehand. The dogs were well-behaved overall. There were several in the lobby off and on, and we heard barking twice from our room. Lastly, the weekend rate in February was a great deal, we thought. But that was before we added in the cost to valet park. It's posted $36 a night, but with taxes it was about $44/night.

When checking in again the staff was so nice and the room was good size and clean. The only negative is request another blanket for the bed. There is no bed covering. We just like the feel of a heavier blanket. Food at Sazar was good and reasonable. Busy at the bar at night. We really enjoyed our stay at the Monaco. You can walk to everything.

You know the kind--they look you up and down, decide you are not worthy, and act like checking you in is a big favor. Normally, I could care less, but we'd just arrived from a long train journey, it was dark and rainy out, we had our discombobulated 7-year-old in tow, and could have used some 'hail fellow well met' at that moment. Publicity boasts about catering to the young uns, but I had to search the website the next day to see what was available for him, and then ask, which put the morning staff in a flutter, because the person who checked us in--I'm looking at you, chilly night check-in guy--should have taken care of it. A much heralded gold fish was brought to our room, which then died. Okay, it happens, it is a living thing, but when we called to have it removed--more 7-year-old discombobulation--we were cheerfully told to put it outside the door, and chirpily asked if we'd like another. I know it's just a fish, but the attitude seemed rather cavalier, especially with a child involved. Yes, they have coffee and tea, but 2 days in a row I had to tell them they'd run out of hot water, breakfast tea, and milk. Don't count on it if you are off to business meetings in the morning as I was. And then there is the nickle and diming that I just can't stand when I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel room--one-ply toilet tissue, big bottles of shampoo and soap bolted to the wall, slippers with a "if-you-use-these-we'll-charge-you-$15" tag attached to them. I moved to the Fairmont, got my slippers for free, had beautiful toiletries and was treated to super-friendly service at every juncture.

The only reasonable feature of the Monaco is the staff, all of whom are relentlessly friendly and helpful; for example, they gave us a voucher to soothe the grouchiness caused by cold morning showers. The goldfish deal is a total gimmick and matters not a bit. We didn't take advantage of the afternoon wine. Our room had a view of a concrete wall from street to sky - in other words, we could see nothing.

The rooms were very small -- almost like a large walk-in closet. The gym downstairs was cramped, as well, with just a couple of cardio machines. They do have an agreement with Gold's Gym where guests can use Gold's during their stay with Hotel Monaco, but be prepared to hike a few blocks down the street. They offer free wi-fi, which is good. They also had a cocktail hour in the lobby at 5 pm at which they serve beer, wine, sangria and other non-alcoholic bevs, in addition to some finger food.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115669097">We recently stayed in this hotel for a week and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The rooms are great. They take you beyond the norm as far as decor goes. Really refreshing. The nightly wine reception was very nice. They had a nice selection of non alcoholic drinks for those that didn't wish to have the wine. The hotel itself is right in the heart of downtown. Easy walking distance to the Pike Public Market, shopping, 5th avenue theater etc. The staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and appreciated. When looking for a restaurant to go to one evening we asked at the front desk about a certain place. We were told straight out that the place was not worth the time or our money. They tell it to you straight up. If arriving by air at the SeaTac airport, you can hop on the Light Link Rail and arrive at a station just one block from the hotel. $6.00 instead of $50 for a cab. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR110997210">Small cramped rooms, lackluster service, great location add up to 3 stars.

The staff was wonderful the property very clean and centrally located (six blocks from the market). It was easy to get to. The rooms were spacious (double queen) and clean. My only complaint is there was no coffee in the room. Not even a little four cup coffee maker.. I mean this is Seattle, home to Starbucks and other coffee brands? Coffee goes hand and hand with a stay in a hotel. In Seattle I would expect the micro brews of coffees to be sampled in the room, like Portland does with beer.

But I'm not quite sure what make it "luxury" in nature. The rooms are small, but that's to be expected I suppose in a big city. However, I had a chance to visit a different hotel, a 3 star, in the same area, and the rooms were 2x as big. The rooms were decorated in a very boutique quality, with red/white stripes. The bathrooms were small, and very very plain. Nothing close to some of the luxury hotels I've stayed in in the past. But the hotel was very clean, comfortable, and in walking distance of most of the downtown attractions, which was what I was looking for. For the price I got on Hotwire, it was great. For the regular going luxury hotel price, not so much. Now the hospitality. The hotel staff were very nice for the most part, but I had read so many reviews about how they went above and beyond. This was not the case when I visited. I looked like crap when I arrived at the hotel - after delays at the airport, and 2 layovers, I looked about 15 years old, with terrible bed hair. I got to the hotel in the middle of the day, and the two doorman just looked at me. No "Let me grab the door" or "Let me help you with your luggage." Just looked at me, grunted a "hey, good afternoon" and went back to talking. This ended up being the last time I ever saw a doorman for my entire weekend stay. Got to the front desk, and immediately, the clerk judged either my appearance, or my booking through Hotwire. He mumbled a few things about the hotel, gave me my key, and went back to doing whatever he was doing. A girl at the desk was checking in a different customer, a older, male gentleman, and went through a clear, welcoming explanation of the hotel and amenities, and asked if he was a Klimpton member. He said no, and she explained how he could sign up for free internet. All of which was never even asked, or mentioned to me. I looked back at my clerk and said "Um, Im a member. how do I access the internet?" He suddenly became a lot nicer. From then on, I really didn't bother with the hotel staff. The cleaning crew were very nice and helpful however. They helped me out when I couldn't find my toothpaste and the front desk said "Oh we ran out." uh. huh. The last day I needed a taxi, and told the front desk to call one 10mins before I checked out (Seattle is not known for its cab services...so you really have to call in advance). I walked out...no cab. "Oh we called! He should be here asap" 10mins later, no cab. I asked the front desk to call again, and they said "Oh sure, in a bit" Um. No. I ended up taking a gypsy cab that I hailed myself that cost me 2x as much, but I had a business meeting and I was nearly late. I guess I would recommend it, for the price on hotwire ($90 a night), for the cleanliness, the location, and the cleaning staff. But the hospitality left a lot to be desired.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR95228524">The Hotel Monaco is situated in downtown Seattle within walking distance to 'must see' sites such as Pike Street marketplace, waterfront and shopping.

In-room Coffee Maker can be requested, but the one they delivered to the room was worn down and the coffee mug was filthy. We didn't use it. - Furniture: Upholstered furniture with stains, casegood furniture are poorly assembled and sticky from wear, Furniture in general were tired and worn - Bedding/Sheets: Stained sheets and pillow covers first night, second night was fine. Notes: - Parking: Hotel Valet Parking was $40. (It's generally expensive in this area).

We always love staying at Kimpton hotels and have stayed at the Alexis Hotel and Hotel Vintage Park in Seattle, so this time we decide to try the Hotel Monaco. As expected, our stay was wonderful. When we arrived we were met by the bellman how helped with our luggage. This was helpful since we had brought our two Shih Thus with us. Check in was quick and in less than 5 minutes, the valet had our car and we were checked in and heading to our room. The room was very nice with a small living room that made it a little more than â€œjust a roomâ€�. We had room service the first night and the food was great and was delivered in less than 20 minutes. Evening turndown service got our room ready for the night including chocolates on the pillow. The hotel is in the perfect spot in Seattle because you can walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, the movies, the shopping center and even the tram to get you around town. The hotelâ€™s wine reception was great and we found others had brought their pets with them. Kimptonâ€™s â€œpet friendlyâ€� program is wonderful. We came back from running around one night and found a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. Our three days went by much too fast and we really did not want to leave, but all good things must come to an end. The good news is we can always go back and know we will get great service.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR90394115">Valet and bell service were very prompt. Front desk staff were very friendly and nice and provided directions to business locations. Bell service from lobby to room was very quick. We have 2 pets who we often take with us on leisure and business trips. So Kimpton hotels are great for families with pets. Loved that pet beds and dishes were already set up in the room, nice touch. Although, to most travelers rooms are probably just average, but for us pet owners who take our little friends with us it's a nice hotel. Some "Pet Friendly" hotels can be real dumps and Monaco is certainly not one of them. Only down side is being right in downtown Seattle is there are limited grassy potty spots, so that's a bid of a bummer. Also, walls are a little thin and we could hear our neighbors having a good time (wink*wink*) and were pretty vocal about it. Probably could have slept through it but the dogs kept jumping up and off the bed trying to figure out where the noise was coming from or perhaps they thought someone was in need of rescue.

The location was great; we were able to walk to WNBA, MLS, and MLB games. There were a couple issues with the service. We are members of the InTouch club and are supposed to get newspapers delivered to the room each day. We only got papers two of the five days. I asked the front desk after the fourth day, and they said "well, there are other guests, and sometimes we run out, but there's a whole bunch of papers over there against the wall". Then, I didn't get the paper the next day either. My young son was supposed to get a welcome gift as part of the InTouch club, but he received nothing. I asked about this the next morning, and they said there's a box where kids can go chose something (we got a deck of cards). Also, for the morning tea/coffee service in the lobby, the black tea ran out very early each day as did the lemonade/tea in the afternoon. It seems there's just a half hearted effort for these "perks". They should either support the service or not. Other than these things, the hotel was fine.

As I explored, I discovered that the smell was coming from the carpet and the upholstered chairs. One of the chairs had a dark stain on the seat. I don't have anything against pets or pet owners. But I do have a big complaint when a hotel doesn't clean up and disinfect the room adequately after a guest (canine or human) urinates and/or defecates on the carpet or furniture.

The hotel is within walking distance to the Heart of the City. It is extremely quiet considering the location. The rooms are spacious and super comfortable, with well appointed large bathrooms. We noticed refillable bottles of shampoo and soap, which indicated their efforts to minimize waste. They offer complementary coffee and pastries in the morning in the main lobby. In the evening they host a complementary wine tasting event which allows you to mingle with other guests and share dining and/or shopping tips. Very pleasant. The hotel restaurant is not outstanding but certainly adequate for a casual meal or Happy Hour.

On returning to the front desk, they said they couldn't find one - but there was no apology for not contacting me to let me know this fact. They then said that engineering would be in in 15 minutes and they would then possibly be able to find one and let me know. After waiting a further 40 minutes from the scheduled time that engineering would turn up, there was still no answer. I returned to the front desk to be told off handedly that engineering didn't have one. Once again, no apology for the delay or lack of information. THe general seevice from the desk staff was uncaring and lacked professionalism.

I got a decent rate of $132/night for a room with a King bed. The hotel is definitely fairly well kept up and the service is friendly. I like the fact that they have wine served in the lobby between 5P-6P, and coffee and tea served between 7A-9A, courtesy of the hotel. However, I found that the lobby gets pretty packed with guests wanting their free coffee/wine on the weekends so there's no place to sit down. Also, one morning they ran out of coffee in the lobby, and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to bring out some more. The hotel's restaurant, Sazerac, is a good restaurant with pretty good drinks. It was convenient being able to get a nice dinner in the hotel. Just be sure to make reservations for dinner, since it can get pretty busy there during Happy Hour on the weeknights. The thing I wasn't so happy about with the hotel are its thin walls. I could hear my neighbors talking and moving about, and could really feel the neighbor's kids jumping on the bed. It makes you wonder if there would be any privacy for a romantic weekend, if you get my drift. Also, the doors on the tv cabinet were askew. Also, I'm not sure why it's so difficult to find a decent workout room in a hotel. I tried out Hotel Monaco's fitness room, and found that the equipment was pretty out-dated. The one treadmill in the room wasn't evening working, and they charged guests if they wanted to hook headsets into the tv monitors attached to the machines. There were no mats to sit and stretch on and the quarters were tight. I'm accustomed to cycling machines, but the resistance of Monaco's cycling machine was really off, and I had a difficult time cycling with just a resistance of 2, which should be really easy. Although the goldfish rentals appear to appeal to some, it seems a little abusive to me. I was uncomfortable with seeing the "used" goldfish, left out in front of the rooms, once the guests were done with them. Maybe Hotel Monaco should just set up a nice, well-kept stationary fish tank in the lobby for all to enjoy. I bet the fish would be happier, and isn't that the point of the fish tanks? It's supposed to be for animal lovers. Overall, Hotel Monaco was a comfortable place to stay. I like it's smaller size, compared to the Sheraton and Hyatt down the street. It gives it a more cozy feel, and probably encourages more personal service. The location is very convenient for sightseeing, yet far enough away from the noisier downtown shopping areas near Nordstrom's.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR53116655">We got a very good deal on staying here through a site like Priceline and were really happy with the place.

"You can order room service". I don't want to order room service to get coffee in my room. "I'll have a coffee maker sent up". LOL. They keep them in the closets in the hall if people insist - otherwise they make a little more money on room service. The "buffet" for Thanksgiving was $40 per plate. Hmmmmmm. Restaurants were closed and they took advantage of that. 2 scrambled eggs for breakfast, $18. Bottom line: Shop around and make sure you factor in the parking as part of the room rate. Probably still a good deal so if you come be ready to fight back on their nickel and diming game. 1) Bring your own snacks and cocktails and stay away from their overpriced mini-bar. 2) Eat outside the hotel. 3) Make certain they bring you a coffee maker when you check in and bring your own coffee because you know you'll have to fuss everytime you need a new pack.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR49013039">We got a great deal on our room and were really pleased with our stay!

I send the Kimpton preferred guest website an email asking about the failure to provide a suite as advertised on their website (my reservation description) (also furnished a hard copy of the reservation printout (from their website) to the front desk manager on duty) and did not get any reply or solution. I also send an email after the trip (guest survey) and once again did not get any follow up via email or mail. So I guess that tell you how concerned they are about guest. The staff ranged from indifferent to not helpful. I asked the front desk if their was any good breakfast spots in the neighborhood hood and was told, no only the hotels. Gee I found one of the best breakfast spots in Seattle 1/2 a block away, how convenient that the hotel does not know they exist. We arrived late the first night (11 pm) and had to go inside and run down the bellman who busy chating on his cell phone to get any help with our bags. Prior to my arrival I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my 20th Anniversary as my other half is really picky so I wanted to make sure everything was good to go. I got a nice email back saying they would like to deliver a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries to our room upon arrival to celebrate. I also told them we needed foam pillows. So upon arrival no champagne or strawberries, no foam pillows and we had a great room with a view of an alley and high rise building -nice! Now the good - you will not find a better housekeeping staff or a cleaner room than this property. We were very impressed that when we left each morning to go out shopping that they made up the room before we got back (even short trips of 2 hours or less). The beds were comfortable. Not so good - the AC-Heat control has a 4 x 4 inch screen that is bring green and will shine directly in your eyes all night. If you are light sensitive, you will have to tape something over the controls. This is not a 4 start hotel, it a very clean business hotel with super high rates. You can do better at any of the chain hotels in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20096360">The Hotel Monaco in Seattle is a good hotel but I wouldn't put it at 4* level. Positives: Large bathroom (Mediterranean Suite) Comfortable bed &amp; pillows Attentive housekeeping staff Negatives: AC unit malfunctioned throughout the stay Front desk disorganized. Missed 3 separate wakeup calls. Concierge was always busy and hard to get in touch with. Didn't provide much guidance on special requests. TV hard to use and iPod sound dock in suite non functioning. ---- I decided to book a Mediterranean Suite for my 3 night weekend stay after my 1st choice (where the rest of my party was) filled up. In comparison to the W, I spent about $45 more per night but had a larger (square footage) room with a great soaking tub (with whirlpool jets) and a nice shower. Before my stay, I had the hotel arrange a car service, the price $53 with tip was reasonable and the driver was waiting for me on arrival. Checkin was easy but the downside was that with a room that was picked for its 2 person jacuzi tub, I found no bath accessories (salts, bubble bath etc...) and didn't get any during the stay. The first night (got in around 12/1a) I checked in and had a voucher for a bottle of champagne (nice gesture) and the fish waiting in my room. First impression is that the room was huge but there was so much open space I felt that the room was almost too big. The TV was far away from the bed so it was a chore to change the channel. The iPod dock was also broken which was disappointing. In the morning on my way out I asked for someone at the desk to check the thermostat out (it said 65F but was around 74, which was about 2 degrees too warm) and try to cover its face for me at night (bright blue light kept me up). When I got back to the room that night, no one had done either. That was the 1st drop by the front desk. I called maintainence and someone came to look at the thermostat but he told me to play around with the settings until I was happy (why have a digital box if it won't work!?!??!?!) I asked for a wakeup call at 10am the next morning, that didn't happen. I called later for a 6pm nap wakeup call.... they forgot that. The 10am wakeup call the next morning, yep, it was forgotten. The bathroom facilities were great in this room but I was surprised that a room sold for its whirlpool bath tub wouldn't have had any bath amenities. It was great to relax in the water with the jets going.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19612732">Fantastic Hotel. Get the goldfish to keep you company.

We paid $300 for the suite with the jetted two-person jacuzzi tub. The hotel has a boutique feel - the rooms are decorated with a lot of stripes and reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. The room we had was huge but had a lot of empty space which was a little strange. The jacuzzi tub was huge and could definitely accommodate two people and was like a hot-tub. The only thing was that the hotel did not provide any bubble bath etc. which would seem normal when offering such a large tub. Parking was outrageous - $40 a night. We previously paid $19/night at the Residence Inn. We ended up parking for free overnight at a meter spot. Room service was fast but the selection was limited and the food was okay, not great. Overall, I didn't have any problems with Hotel Monaco - it just didn't seem worth the high price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16741202">Had a wonderful time at the Hotel Monaco. The location was excellent, a short stroll to the main downtown shopping area. Pet friendly but the room showed no signs of animal hair, smells, etc. We had a monaco suite and the sleeping area had big striped curtains which could be pulled closed, a nice touch which felt cosy. Had a goldfish named Brandi who we enjoyed. We didn't partake in the free wine or coffee/tea service in the lobby but thought it was a great feature. Great staff all around, very friendly. Free wireless internet throughout the hotel which worked in the suite on our 2 laptops. The decor was a lovely, eclectic mix of pattens in the same color palatte. Animal print bathrobes made us feel like rock stars.

The hotel was decorated very nicely and the room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom amenities were top notch and the robes were a nice touch. The concierge (not Art) was not helpful when we inquired about local Seattle restaurants and the next day, when he still had not responded to us, he saw us in the lobby and quickly walked the other way to avoid us. The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The goldfish pet for the weekend was fun to have, and we had a goldfish couple. The hotel did send up a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne our first day which was unexpected and very thoughtful. Huge drawback was the noise from 4th street. We were on the 10th floor and the sound of the street, especially the buses, was incredible. The windows don't open so it would be smart of them to just invest in some double-paned windows. Walk just two blocks to McCormicks Bar and Grille (of McCormicks &amp; Schmicks) and they have an amazing happy hour with $1.95 appetizers (after 10 pm). It's and incredible deal for high-end steak house food.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14562502">I stayed in a Queen/Queen room with 3 other people. We all agreed that our room looked much nicer, brighter, funkier, warmer online than it did in person. In reality it was dark, and not sure what was going on with the decor- it was very tacky, and not the type of room i felt like hanging out it all day. I felt the bed was comfortable, but my friends felt it was far too soft. The person at the front desk when we first arrived was not very helpful. She was rather snobby and we felt like we were an inconvenience every time we asked her a question. On the plus side, the lobby was very nice. The complimentary happy hour every night between 5-6 was also a great bonus. The bellboy and valet were very friendly and quite helpful when we asked for suggestions on where to eat. And overall the hotel was very clean, which is a must for me. It was an okay stay. But i probably wouldn't stay there again, mostly because the room is not what I expected and though it was decent and clean, I guess it's not what I was looking for.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14037261">Another pet friendly hotel. They even have a resident hotel dog. We had a corner room which was large and well appointed. I love the funky chic decor. Comfortable reading chaise and lamp. The windows in our bathroom were huge! The had sliding shutters to block out any viewing! It was Christmas time and they had a beautiful tree in the lobby and gingerbread house made by the staff. It lent itself to the holiday spirit while we enjoyed the complimentary wine and champagne tasting. (Try not to miss it...they even have beer and non-acoholic drinks) I would pick this hotel over Hotel Vintage Park because they do have a small workout room. Some of the equipment didn't work...my only complaint...and nothing to wipe the equipment with either.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11988133">I have stayed at about 3 of the Moncao branded hotels. The Seattle version is the least ornate out of all I have stayed at, but it still a beautiful hotel. We stayed 2 nights, and I had gotten a suite with a whirlpool tub to relax. Our A/C stopped working and we had to be moved to another room. Beware if you get a room with an alley view as the garbage trucks WILL wake you no matter what floor your are on. The glass was not soundproof as it was touted. Staff was friendly and helpful, the valets were quick to get our vehicle parked at their offsite garage. The beds are definatly made for sleeping. Very soft and plush, and the minifridges and snack cabinets have everything you could want. I have to say that the rooms do feel quite bland compared to their sister-hotels. I felt as if the room should have cost me about 50-60% of what it did. Overall, I don't think I would stay at this particular hotel again, but I will continue to stay at Monacos. I sure love those goldfish. :)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11934355">I quite like the Monaco. It has a good, but not completely central position in Seattle. It's a short walk (in a European way) to the centre. The common areas are smallish, but the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Bar is part of a popular restaurant so not intimate but does the job nonetheless. The room was good, the decor a little gaudy but if you like an individual style that will suit. The room was not huge but adequate and had most amenities. All in all a pretty good choice in Seattle<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8724369">Nice hotel, but nothing really special. The room decor is hideous. Room is very dark and not enough natural light comes through the window, and there are simply too many colors. It was very hard to get comfortable in a room that I felt like was screaming at me. Pink and white candy striped wallpaper should be outlawed. Too many wall hangings and too many disjointed colors. Purple vases didn't match anything in the room and made me feel like I was at Mardi Gras. The pink, yellow, grey and green floral-and-ivy animal scene patterned chair is ugly, ugly, ugly. A simple wood bed would have been a better choice instead of the sky-blue and gold painted headboard I was given. Room, hotel, and restaurant are very clean. Staff is super friendly and very attentive. Flat screen tv is quite nice. Bathroom has marble counters and fixtures and floor look very clean and fresh. Wine bar from 5-6 is nice, but I was in Seattle for work, so it was hard to get to the hotel during this super-short happy hour that literally lasted exactly one hour. Overall, an average experience, but the W and Fairmont hotels across the street will give a nicer room, in the same location, for comparable prices.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8718266">We were in Seattle September 5-9th and had a heck of time finding a hotel. Apparently UW, Boise State, WSU and San Diego Street were in town for football games and brought their entire schools with them! Rates were higher than we had hoped for that weekend (should have come over Labor Day, rates were much cheaper) but the Hotel Monaco was worth it. Be sure to check the event calendar of the city as rates fluctuate dramatically. We booked a Monte Carlo suite as that was the only room available and it was fantastic for a four night stay. The extra sitting area was more like a funky living room than hotel room. There were curtains that partitioned the bed from the living room but I think they were decoration only (would have been cool if they really closed). The room has bold striped wall paper and a very spacious bathroom. What really made the stay was the staff, they were amazing! I was worried at first because they seemed so young but they were most attentive. The property is small enough that they get to know you and are always trying to help you out. Location was good, all hotels that we considerd seemed to be in a 5 block radius so I can't say anyone really has an advantage. We walked everywhere.

A nice hotel, if it were priced at $100-$150 per night, but it's not. The hotel takes a beating on the 'value' quotient. The whole experience was simply average. Nothing exceptional, and if you're paying $300+, I don't see how you can't be terribly disappointed. My wife and I stayed in their nicest "suites" for less than $200/night, and felt like we were almost overpaying. The best advice I can give is to shop around. Quality-wise, it's in a league with your average Marriott or a nice Best Western.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8271286">The hotel is in a good location.

The staff at the front desk is very rude and very snotty - very brusque in dealing with their guests. It also takes a while for your car to get picked up by the valets so if in a rush, allow for some time. In terms of security thought, only floors 10 and 11 require key access. So request a room on that floor. On the plus side, the hotel has a great location in the heart of downtown. I also like the fact that they have a comfortable bed (down comforters) and instead of curtains, they have shutters in the room. Another hint is to request a non-pet room unless you want to stay in a room where other animals have stayed in before.

My friend checked into the room a few hours earlier and I came in later. When I pulled up to the valet, the young man just stood there. I asked him if the valet was open and he said it was. I had to pull my bags out, he didnâ€™t even offer to help. After I got my garment bag and suitcase, I came up to him to give the car key and room number; he says "I am not the valet". I had to put everything back into the car, park the car on the side of the street and pull everything out again. I left the key with who ever he was working there and asked him to have the "valet" park the car when he gets back. I went up to the room, everything seemed fine, the bottle of champagne was there, the oil and lotion gift from the spa. We dressed and went out, when we came back and got into bed, we noticed blood drops on both the pillows and on the sheets where the pillows were. I was so disgusted, this was just unbelievable. We called the desk and they sent somebody up almost 20 minutes later! He swapped our sheets out and left with out even apologizing. Sunday morning we called the front desk to speak to management about the sheets and they became very aggravated and rude with us. Apparently there was no manager or any kind of supervisor over the weekend and we had to wait until Monday morning. The young man we spoke to said that they would cover the food, adding that the person that changed the sheets said that it was fresh blood, in a very rude tone. Our checkout was at 3pm because of the package that we booked. From 12 to 1:30, three staff (maids) tried to walk into the room, and after opening the door apologizing and closing it. Two people called up saying that "check out was at 12" and I had to remind them of the package. I finally packed all my things up and went downstairs to check out. Quickly signed the paper and took off. When on the way, I took a closer look at the room bill. Unfortunately they never covered the food, which they had offered and we were charged for the valet. I called the front desk to ask about the charges, the lady that answered snapped back saying that they were aware of the problem we experienced and I should call back on Monday like they told us earlier. I have never in my life been treated like this at any hotel anywhere. I am not sure if this hotel constantly has problems or if we were the lucky ones, but I would never stay there again and never recommend it to anybody I know.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6584201">What a fun hotel!

I booked a suite here because I really like the Kimpton hotels and knew I could bring my dog and also get in-room spa treatments. I chose the Mediterranean Suite w/ jacuzzi tub (@ $329 a night). I had high expectations and they were dashed pretty quickly. At check-in, no one offered to help with luggage. I struggled up to my third floor suite, which was pretty dark (only one window in the room and that faces a building) and had stained carpet (large reddish stains... possible crime scene?). There was no room service menu and the ethernet cable in the room was broken and didn't work (there is wireless). The fitness center is not acceptable for a hotel in this price range and reputation. It's difficult to get there (only one elevator goes to the lower level and that isn't noted so I had to call for instructions as to how to get to the lower level). Once you find the fitness center, its odd arrangement has to be noted. Cardio equipment faces a mirror wall while the communal television is behind you. If you want to use the small televisions attached to the cardio equipment, you'll have to go back upstairs to the front desk to get headphones. The equipment isn't very impressive and the lone treadmill is "out of order". You can find better facilities at a Holiday Inn Express. The in-room spa treatments presented a lot of confusion. Several phone calls were required to confirm treatments and even then, one treatment was cancelled just minutes before its scheduled time. This is a nice service and one of the big benefits Kimpton offers, but the Monaco Seattle isn't handling this service well. Room service staff was great, but food was only so-so. Doesn't compare to other great Kimpton restaurants (the Cypress in Cupertino and the Palomar in San Francisco have excellent restaurants). In-room jacuzzi would have been great, but a ring of grime circled the tub. And once filled with water, a multitude of dirty "floaters" were in evidence. This was an OK stay. But several new boutique hotels have recently opened in Seattle that offer more in terms of service and attention to detail. The Monaco is going to have to improve if they hope to compete.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5624914">This is a very nice hotel. However, when I am paying top dollar, I expect top service. Nothing happened that wasn't "just life", but I expected a little more supervision....like...my alarm clock went off twice in the middle of the night...I had not set it...the 2nd time I couldn't get it to quiet, so I unplugged it, but then lost my middle of the night timepiece...I would have expected that the cleaning staff might check the alarm clock to make sure it wasn't set to go off from a previous guest's setting. This isn't a horrible thing, but I was paying a lot of money, and expecting a lot of service. Also, my bathtub's stopper was stuck, and I couldn't get it lifted so shower water would drain...Maintenance was relatively prompt, but why put a guest in a less-than-perfect room? Again, paying top dollar demands over-the-top service. There was no tea in the room with the complimentary coffee, and I was directed to order it from room service if I wanted it. $350/night, and no tea? Heavens! Again, just a small breach of service I would tolerate from a lesser hotel. I requested another toothbrush, and was told it was available in my minibar; in lesser hotels, toothbrush provision is complimentary. This was aggravating. The room was large, clean, quiet, safe...and expensive. I was expecting a higher level of service, so I was disappointed. The front desk supervisor did credit my bill $50 for my inconveniences, and I am very appreciative.

The flat screen TV was a nice treat, as were pay-per-view movies and a well stocked honor bar. The concierge was able to direct us to an excellent boat tour of the harbor and locks as well as to make dinner reservations. We ate the first night in the hotel restaurant which had excellent food and excellent service up until the last moment when the server lost his cool over a small error in calculating the check. I highly recommend the crab cakes appetizer, which together with an appetizer and Washington State wine made a wonderful meal.

Reviews in here that mention that hotel staff is lacking in service are right on the mark. In fact, I would hazard to say they go out of their way to stay away from guest. We had 4 in the room including our children and staff kept leaving only 3 sets of towels. Not a big deal but for $320/night I expect better. This hotel has some mangement problems that need to be addressed. Employees are not as friendly as you find at other Kimpton hotels (Argonaught in San Fran was first class and worth the additional dollars). Not once was I addressed by my name or even acknowledged by employees. The restaurant was nothing but ordinary and way overpriced. I don't mind the overpriced part of it if I get special attention and service. You don't at this hotel. The rooms are dull but spacious.

If you like the large chain hotels (i.e. Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) and prefer that type of standard room and amenities, do not stay at the Monaco. In my opinion, those hotels, while nice, begin to all look the same after some time. However, if you prefer a smaller, boutique-type hotel with surprising, unique and whimisal rooms, you'll love it here. The service at the front desk was excellent. The wine happy hour was very nice, serving local Snoqualamie wines. My room was wonderful with a wall of windows and window seats. I was happy to discover that windows also lined the wall of the bathroom - which I have never enjoyed in a hotel. (It is nice to have some natural light in a bathroom!) The Monaco offers an easy walk to the waterfront, shopping and Pike Place Market. One point worth mention: if you are walking to the waterfront, do not walk down the street at the corner of the hotel - the sidewalk there is very steep downwards. Instead, walk down 4th street towards the Market, and head down to the waterfront a few blocks down - the sidewalks are not so steep and scary there. And while you are staying at the Monaco, do not miss going inside the Seattle Public Library across the street. It is an architectual masterpiece and definitely not your average "library." Tours are also given daily. I've stayed at other Monaco hotels and thoroughly enjoyed this one, like the others. Any time I have the opportunity to stay at a Kimpton hotel, I will. I might also say, though, that the Kimpton Hotel Vintage Park, up the street from Monaco in Seattle, is not as impressive, but stays true to the unique hotel experience.

I regularly stay there each summer and this last visit left me looking for new lodging options in the Emerald City. I have stayed in both the Monte Carlo Suite and a King Deluxe. PROS: - Rooms are a decent size for a city - The beds are extremely comfortable - The room has functional furniture - including a desk with 2 chairs and a comfy chair to relax in (in standard rooms) and a nice sofa an coffee table (in the Monte Carlo Suites) - Room service is very good - the Continental breakfast is fantastic and service is prompt. - The hotel has added large flat-screen televisions and DVD players in every room. CONS: - Service, service, service. I waited 15+ minutes just to check-in and was not "welcomed back" as a Kimpton In Touch member. - The front desk reception never greeted me as I came and went (something they always used to do). - They mishandled packages and phone calls routinely (not so great for a business traveler). - My Kimpton In Touch preferences were ignored altogether (room type, pillow type, etc) The personal touches are what make Kimpton hotels special.

Especially since the Monaco Seattle was 100 dollars more than the SF Monaco. We were traveling home to Copenhagen so I considered using Priceline to bid low for a four star hotel. But I was so impressed with the SF Monaco that I wanted specifically to try their Seattle hotel. On the plus side, the staff was lovely and service was always prompt. The lobby was beautiful and the staff allowed us a generous 3pm checkout so we could relax before our overseas flight. The room was quiet and clean and everything worked. But we were surprised to see that the room was decorated hideously. The room we got did not, in any way shape or form resemble the beautifully designed rooms advertised on the hotels Web site. The pillows for the beds were left in the chairs and there was no bedspread. The wall paper was grey and white and very depressing. In SF, I loved the Monaco's whimsical colorful style but there was no color or design in this room. Here, I felt they had really misrepresented their rooms which were dull and boring. For me a nice decor helps make me feel at home and cheers me up and this room didnt do the trick. I actually factor in decor when I book a room and sure, the photos they advertised are usually a bit more polished than the reality but at the Monaco Seattle, it was a pure misreprentation of the decor advertised. At the San Francisco Monaco, there was a lovely spa with a sauna and big hot tub. Here in Seattle, we paid 100 dollars more than SF and there was no spa at all. Why was it so much more? Finally, the room service menu did not include any vegetarian dishes except pizza. It seems like a no brainer to consider vegetarians when you make a room service menu. If you can include dogs, why not cover about the 10 percent of the population that doesnt eat meat. We were very disappointed with the Monaco Seattle. But if you are a carnivore who doesn't care for spas or decor, you might just love the place. The service can't be faulted.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5419804">The Hotel Monaco is a quant, charming place to stay in Seattle. The lobby is beautiful and serene, with wall murals of Greek dolphins frolicking in the sea. We stayed in a standard king room and it was decorated in a whimsical, unique style. The room was also comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located in a nice central location and within walking distance to a lot of local attractions. The hotel also offers an â€œhour of indulgenceâ€�, which is a beer and wine tasting. It was nicely done and the day we were there they had a fortune teller. It was a lot of fun. The staff was nice and friendly. I will definitely go back and would recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5373238">My husband and I and our 45 pound dog stayed at the Monaco from May 12th to the 20th, 2006. We got a fantastic last minute rate (staying with the family didn't exactly work out!) and we were overwhelmed by the level of service we received from all areas of the hotel. Every person we encountered, from the very busy front desk and valet personnel to the chamber maids doing turn down service greeted us and our dog warmly on every occasion. Our dog was treated like a queen instead of being shooed away and given the evil eye like what happens at most pet "friendly" hotels. The front desk and bell/valet staff dog sat for us on several occasions and our dog had her very own leopard print chaise lounge to rest on behind the front desk. She was walked and played with and felt so at home she was distressed when we packed up the car to go to our next destination. The room was very comfortable and though it was close to the elevator, we heard no noise from it or from people walking by. The bed was dreamy, the linens divine and the water pressure in the shower was more than adequate. Room service breakfast was on time every morning, very tasty, and the tray was always removed no more than ten minutes after we put it in the hall. We had dinner at the restaurant one evening and were disappointed in the food, but the service was perfect. The Monaco is on Spring and 4th, across from the fabulous modern Library, and there are loads of restaurants within walking distance or a short free bus ride. We were able to take the dog for walks to the federal courthouse two blocks away which has a huge grassy hill and another great view of the library. Overall, this was the best hotel stay I have had in a major city. The Monaco has a customer for life in me and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle - with or without a dog.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5327326">We stayed in a suite at the Hotel Monaco which was just a few $ more than the quoted room. The valet met us and arranged for a bellman to get our bags and bring them to our room which was on the 9th floor tucked into the corner around from the elevator. It was amazingly quiet. We at at Tulio's at the Hotel Vintage Park. The chicken was scrumptious and the risotto was heaven with a hint of orange. It was roomy and included a 2-person jacuzzi tub in the bathroom in addition to shower stall, marble vanity and AVEDA products. After our roadtrip of 9-1/2 hours, the jacuzzi was welcome relief! We didn't order a goldfish pet but they were in the lobby downstairs, referred to as the living room and also in our elevator lobby. The king-size bed with soft, luxurious linens and comforter lulled me to sleep. I wouldn't miss dinner at The Georgian Room at the Fairmount around the corner. It too was amazing and costs almost the same as Tulio's. Food, service and atmosphere were outstanding! It's about 3 blocks downhill (ie up hill when you return) and 2 blocks over to Pike Place Market. You can walk to the Space Needle but allow 30-45 minutes and buses are free within the downtown area. So if you do hop a bus to the Space Needle, it costs $1.25.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4163693">I had really high hopes for the Hotel Monaco when we chose it as our base for a girlfriend's shopping trip to Seattle. But after our stay, I would say that given the competition in Seattle, it was just okay. The hotel has a lot of nice features but little things that detract: The bedding is super soft and luxurious with down comforters and pillows. But the mattress is a rock hard standard hotel bed that kept me awake both nights. The furnishings are nice and the colors and patterns fun but the chair had a rip in it and the wall paper was peeling. We stayed in room 815 and there was a noise like a fog horn that vibrated through the walls off and on through our stay. My guess is it's the water pipes but it was really annoying. On waking the first morning we found that we had two packages of decaf instead of regular coffee. It took them 30 minutes to send up coffee and then they showed up with just one package. This is coffee town USA and you get one little package and 3 tiny dried creamers? There was supposed to be coffee service in the lobby but we never saw any. It must be cleared really early. It's gone by 10AM. The wine reception is from 5-6 and boy you better get there on time because if you walk in at 5:50 like we did you get a look from the manager like you are trying to scope a 2nd glass. That and the food was a plate of goldfish crackers. Classy. Friday night the restaurant and bar were closed by 4pm for a private party. That was where we planned to eat since we'd heard so much about the fun bar. It was another bummer to add to the rest. All over the hotel are posters that say things like the hotel is all about "you" and your comfort etc. But we felt neither catered to or comfortable. No one on staff ever asked us how we were doing or even said hello. We'll be looking elsewhere for our next visit.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4126156">Wow -- from the moment you enter the spacious suite and find yourself smiling at the bright colorful draperies and linens, comfortable furnishings and wonderful touches with Aveda products, mint chocolates and leopard print robes -- to the peace and quiet the room and its placement afford -- you know that you have chosen well.

I got there with my 2 boys around 8:30 at night...they offer a "late" checkin, so I thought we were okay getting there at that time, since I had to work that day and then drive the 2.5 hours down there from Vancouver, BC. We arrived, checked in, went up to our room, and there was ONE bed. My 2 sons are BOTH over 6 feet tall, and there was NO way, I was going to sleep on the couch, or make one of them sleep on the couch, since I reserved a room that would sleep all of us. When I went downstairs to inform them, and ask for a different room, they let me know that if I booked through a 3rd party (Hotwire) then they only had to give me what was left, and not what I requested. Oh REEEEEEAAAALLLLLY?!?! So, I ended up having to pay $40/night for a room UPGRADE, because apparently THAT room (with 2 beds) wasn't "AVAILABLE". WTF. Nighttime front desk service was dismal. Daytime service, was lovely. Oh...and...be prepared to spend $30 on hotel parking, PER NIGHT. Public lots only charge $10 overnight, and $12 daytime....so somehow, the hotels (who are taking all your money in the first place) can't give guests a rate break, but instead, charge even MORE. Bad. Bad.

Housekeeping man compared his Blackberry to mine in the hallway and Housekeeper returns to the room with facecloths only to "scold" me for something.

There is also a movie theater and small grocery store across the street. Also, there is a restaurant on site. Check in experience was surprisingly good- long wait but front desk agent was super nice! My complaints about the hotel would be the beds and bathroom! The beds were extremely uncomfortable- squeaky and quality that you would find at a MOTEL. The bathroom was super small! The water pressure was low for sink and shower due to them "Going Green". I'm all about going green but I felt like I used more water because the pressure was low.

Old vintage tv you may be lucky to find in a thrift shop. Shower is about a foot too low for a 6' guy. On the other hand, it was cheap, quiet, friendly staff and the bed was comfortable. If you are travelling to Seattle as I did this time, and are hardly going to be in the room, and don't need to catch a game on tv, it really isn't bad.

They have a good breakfast menu too. We paid $10 more for a higher floor with a view of the Space needle. The balcony is small but it wrapped around the corner so we had an obstructed view of Elliot Bay. 2 computers in the business center. They couldn't get them online? The manager looked up what we needed in short order on his computer and would print boarding passes if needed. The swimming pool seems to be permanently out of order.

All of these things added up to a hotel that seemed as though it peaked in 1988 and has been in a state of decline since. I was also given a terrible room: on the second floor (207), with banquet staff passing by my door constantly, the neon lights of the Cinerama just outside of my window, and listening to buses drive by all day and night. It felt like I was sleeping in a bus terminal. When I asked for another room, I was told that I would have to pay more for anything better (though the hotel hardly seemed busy).

I was then told by a lady at the front desk that our type of room was not available but if we wanted to upgrade there would be a room available. I asked how much and was told $50/ night. Totally not worth it so decided to pass. She then tried to put us in a different room. She made a comment about it being for a king bed when we reserved two double beds. I corrected her and she was then arguing with me about it saying that the rate I paid was not enough for the double bed room. I pulled out my confirmation showing my reservation and she still didn't want to put me in a double bed room. The concierge said he would lock our bags in a closet, which we appreciated. I had returned to retrieve something out of my suitcase and one, the room they were stored in smelled horribly of natural gas, two the concierge came in the room with me and proceeded to hit on me and tried to get me to go out with him that night. Not the end of the world by any means, but very uncomfortable in a closed up small storage closet. The window of our room faced a cement wall. We did not receive any daylight at all, as ithe cement wall blocked out all the light. The room smelled terribly of smoke whenever someone in a room around us was smoking. The smell was so overwhelming that it smelled like someone in our room as smoking. Aside from the dark and smoke smell the room was decent and comfortable.

The hotel is very nice and the front desk clerks are very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a great location: right across the street from a Ralph's Market which has plenty of champagne; a 7 - 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market; close to some great restaurants (Local 360, Serious Pie, Lola) and right next to a cool old cinema (which I didn't go to). The rooms are comfortable and well equipped with nice glasses to drink from and plenty of them. I have no complaints about anything having to do with the room. My main complaint is the horrible room service food (not the guy who actually brought it up, he was very nice). We ordered breakfast in our room both mornings (Sunday and Monday) and the food was not only bland, badly cooked, and cold but both mornings they messed up the order. The last morning I ordered one of their special omelets that comes with mushrooms and cheese and my omelet came without the cheese! That's ridiculous! They did offer to make me a new one but as I had to catch a plane I didn't have a time so I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Because there are so many great restaurants in the area I'm sure you can find another place to eat breakfast, but if you're on a schedule and don't have time to spend leisurely finding a good breakfast joint, you're going to have to suffer through the room service. Sorry and good luck! I slept on the sleeper sofa which was terrible and why I gave them a 3 for sleep quality. I didn't hear my friends complain about the bed so I assume they were fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120178031">Buyer beware if your a Hotwire customer and this is the hotel you get. When I checked in I was informed that the only room available was a smoking room (frankly was surprised there were smoking rooms anymore) But... for $40 more I could upgrade to a nicer room.

The Hotel was old but really nice, spacious room, very comfortable king size bed, very nice bathroom.

We highly recommend this hotel for comfort cleanliness and value for money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120107379">Stayed 1 night at the Warwick hotel on Oct. 29th Arrived at 12:00pm and used self parking, $26.00 for the night and valet is also $26.00 per night. Parked on the 7 level of parkade and took stairs to lobby as there is no elevator in the parkade. Check in was quick and easy less then 5 minutes. Our room was on the second floor and was clean. Room was small with 2 double beds, 26" old tv, small fridge in room and a coffee maker. Small bathroom with a shower and tub combo. Water tap for shower would not shut off completely. Over all if you get a good price for your stay, Under $100.00 a night, The hotel is a decent 3.5 star hotel, Close to most attractions etc.. The staff we encountered were helpful and friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120025243">The hotel was well situated, within easy walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and good public transport.

The staff was more than helpful, even went as far as digging through the kitchen to bring us up a bottle opener. The parking situation is interesting. The garage is adjacent, but stairs have to be used to make it to the hotel lobby; no elevator as an option. It was hard to get the luggage back and forth through the stairwell. We were on the 14th floor, which is one of the more updated floors. It's nice enough, but MUCH smaller that what shows on the pictures. The bathroom is nice but so small only one of us could be in there at a time, which was problematic when getting ready to go out for our dining and dancing. Overall, it's an okay hotel, but I'd probably go with a larger chain close by, that is more updated.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119915886">Stayed here oct 17-19.

The first time it was just for a night and the experience was average. The parking garage is small, crowded and a nightmare to navigate; the attendants are not much help nor as friendly if you choose to park yourself instead of using the valet service. A week later we stayed for 4 nights and used the valet. The people at the desk are friendly enough, but not very informative. The second time around we got a room on the second floor that had not been renovated. I dont mind that the stuff is outdated as long as it works. The hair dryer was not functioning, the tv (big old tv) was fuzzy and did not have a remote control, the shower had no water pressure and when we took out the old beat up ironing board, a dirty handkerchief fell out of the closet; disgusting. If you have to stay there, make sure you ask for a clean, updated room. The reason I did not rate this as "terrible" is because the restaurant was GREAT (although pricy) and the front desk will mail out your post-cards for you--very convenient!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119843410">Cute hotel, but lobby was shabby and should've been redecorated/refurbished years ago. The bed and room were clean and comfortable, although the sheets were greyed/dingy with age (a shame - how much do sheets cost and how often do they replace them???) Location was great, within walking distance of most attractions, shopping, eating and bars - but can be kind of difficult with people with walking disabilities (I have bad knees and it was rather painful for me, especially with the HILLS - Seattle is VERY HILLY in lots of areas). My husband had no trouble at all walking all over the place (he 'scouted' out the area). The staff was very friendly and helpful, esp. the consigner (sp?). Our room was eye level with the parking garage; we asked to be moved - was granted the request but the room was on a lower level and the noise level would have been terrible at night (the view was much better, though), but we opted for 'quiet' instead of 'view' and stayed where we were. Seattle is a beautiful city, but it's hilly and it's filled with a lot of weirdo's and freaks of all ages, and I'm not just talking about the homeless - which there were plenty of them, also. Occupy Seattle was going on when we were there, and they were all tattooed, pierced, weird dressed, dirty/nasty drudge/dred locked, grungy-looking young people, and we have young adult kids ourselves, in addition to other young people in our city, so we KNOW what 'weird' looks like. As soon as we entered downtown Seattle, we saw an â€˜Occupy Seattleâ€™ person sitting in a pretty, flowered/treed area, smoking a cigarette and holding a handmade sign that read: â€œKill Wall Streetâ€� and had a skull and bones sign drawn on it. Not a very pleasant â€˜welcomingâ€™ to Seattle, I thought. There was also a huge paddy wagon (VERY large van) and tons of policemen at the main gathering site of the protesters, which was downtown in the main shopping district. Seattle IS a nice place, but itâ€™s a shame there are so many weirdos around. Hopefully the protesters will move on by the time future visitors visit this lovely city. This hotel is o.k. if youâ€™re on a budget and have no trouble walking, and IF you get a good rate â€“ we got it for $99, so we couldnâ€™t pass it up. I didn't rate this hotel very high because there's no reason why hotels have dingy/grey looking sheets - it lowers one's opinions about the place, even if the room itself is very clean. Our room also had the old tube tv, but that didn't matter to me but it might matter to others.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119686863">Downtown Seattle is an expensive place to book a hotel room -- $99 per night rate is considered â€œbudget.â€� (i.e., the Travelodge by the Space Needle is $125 per night). So, finding a hotel with the location that Warwick has -- for $99 per night --I didnâ€™t have great expectations, although it is part of an international â€œluxuryâ€� hotel chain. Getting to and from the hotel was easy on the Seattle city bus system, and surrounding it are numerous restaurants of all kinds. Itâ€™s within walking distance of the Pike Place Market and the downtown shopping district and right next door to the Jazz Alley. We were on the 8th floor overlooking the parking lot but had a view of downtown, which was good because any lower the noise from the street would have made sleeping difficult. A room on a higher floor with a view of the Space Needle would have been great but, for a rate of $99, we were fine with the view and the quiet room. The room was not big but very adequate with a somewhat dated dÃ©cor, but it did have some nice touches (nice wall art and a Shoji lantern type floor lamp). The lighting was good and the bed was very comfortable. The marble sink and tub surround are very nice. I especially appreciated the vanity shelf (which I wish more hotels would have) and the complimentary bath items were rather upscale. But, what I was most impressed with is that I believe this hotel actually takes their water conservation program seriously. I was fine with the low water pressure because I was so impressed with the low-flow, QUIET flushing toilet. I was rather surprised, though; that the lobby was so nondescript since the Seattle Warwick is part of a luxury chain, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. So, the Seattle Warwick exceeded my expectations for a â€œbudgetâ€� in the middle of downtown Seattle and we look forward to staying there again soon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119499336">Me and my teenage son came to Seattle for the weekend, with the highlight being the Seahawks game on Sunday. We arrived on Friday morning at the hotel at 10:30am, I was hoping to at least drop my bags off at the hotel as we toured the town, but to my surprise, they actually checked us in our room, it was only 10:30am! I was very pleased with that and a nice way to start off the weekend. I had asked for early check in, but I really didn't expect it that early. The room was acceptable and clean, very much a typical room I would stay in, we weren't here to stay in the room all weekend. Even got a corner room (on 6th floor) that had a view of downtown and of the space needle. Cleaning staff always said "Hi" to me when they could have easily ignored me. Even though we could have stayed closer to the more active part of downtown, I didn't want to pay the higher price and had no problem walking the 4 or so blocks to get to some of tourist spots or the public transportation hubs (we did not rent a car). This area of diowntown seemed very quite compared to just a few blocks south, wasn't much activity around or people walking around when we were there, but I always felt safe. I checked out on the morning of the game, but the front desk still allowed me to check in my luggage with them so I didn't have to take it with me to the game. I was vey appreciative of that. Not renting a car probably saved me $200 in car rental and parking fee's, but we did have to walk and take busses/train, which was pretty simple since I had researched it well, but would have been much more difficult if I had not. Hotel is real close to Top Pots Doughnuts too! Overall, I would stay here again, I felt the combination of the price and location was ideal for this type of trip.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119126348">Arrived at the hotel at 11am on a Sunday and without heistation were given a room. We were using the location as an in transit so only had the one night. The lobby area is compact, basic and functional provided you don't arrive with a group booking. Service was no friills, functional but lacking in friendliness and warmth. The room was a good size with a view, albeit uninspiring. You could open a window but it was a bit noisey at evening time.. There is a theatre (limited opening times) across the road, a grocery store on the other corner and it is a only a 10 minute walk to downtown. We did not explore eating options nearby but there seemed limited choice in the immediate vicinity. The business centre near the lobby has two free internet computers that seem to be in demand so pick your time or wait. We did have dinner at the hotel restaurant and found the service to be OK, the attention to a special diet to be first class, the prices are fair but the meal portions are on the small size. We paid full price but if you can get a special or last minute rate then it would represent good value. OK for an overnight stay but may have reservations for a longer duartion.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119090604">My husband and I stayed here the evening of Monday, September 19th. We arrived via the airport just before 8am and, of course, our rooms were not available. We left our bags and the *RUDE* concierge (light hair) said he would take them â€“ though he did seem to act like maybe they were covered in mud or something?? We left the hotel and walked directly from 4th street up two easy breezy blocks to 2nd street and got some Starbucks. We spent our entire day walking downtown Seattle â€“ from the Pike Place Market to the waterfront (ate at the Crab Pot and took a harbor cruise) to the liquor store on 2nd street &amp; Seneca to the harbor steps and back. We called at 12:00 and our room was not ready yet so we just kept walking and enjoying downtown Seattle as we had a tour planned anyway. We finally returned to our room at 4:30pm. We had prepaid and got a fantastic rate on our room. The *RUDE* concierge saw us come in and made himself invisible. The front desk clerk told us our bags would be delivered to our room so we took the elevator up and hoped she was correct. I had just walked in the bathroom when all the bags were delivered (quickly) but I didnâ€™t see who delivered them. My husband tipped the guy and we worried no more. We had a beautiful view of the Space Needle, a nice comfy bed, a big &amp; clean bathroom, and everything you could really want for a stay. We had a small couch and we prefer one big chair but it worked-out fine. It was nice and cool out this evening so we opened our balcony and let the breeze blow-in. We took a nap and then walked to Ralphâ€™s â€“ literally across the street â€“ and got some deli sandwiches (good) and soda. Ralphâ€™s also sells wine, chips, grocery items, etc but they are quite expensive. We paid $14 for two sandwiches, a yogurt for breakfast the next morning ($3.99 just for that) and a fountain soda. It was worth it for the convenience to the hotel. Ralphâ€™s is open until 2am, btw. We slept well, no noise, despite the area. The ice machine was just one floor down, no problem. There is obvious remodeling going on in the hotel because you could see some of it marked off and smell the new paint but it did nothing to dampen our stay. Our wake-up call came on time and we were showered and dressed and out the door by 6:00 am. Hubby checked us out in no time. We had no charges as we had prepaid and not used the Internet or purchased anything. They put a $50 hold on a credit card but released it later. The morning of Sept 20th we had an incredibly friendly concierge (dark hair) who went out of his way to help us get a ride to the Amtrak station to catch the train to Vancouver â€“ he actually got us a very nice ride to the station for $10 flat. Good deal. Nice concierge, great driver, all was well. Would we stay here again? For the location, price, and convenienceâ€¦ sure. There were A LOT of goods that far outweighed one bad. The concierge from Sept 19th, however, has a lot to learnâ€¦ this was probably the â€œworstâ€� hotel we stayed at on our 20-night vacation and was by far well below the standards we are used too â€“ we have had much better service all over the world - just because we were wearing jeans and shirts does not mean we donâ€™t deserve the same respect as your older business travelers in suits.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118726767">I chose this hotel for a short overnight break to Seattle from Vancouver.

The concierge was helpful, saving us money on transportation to the Mariners game ... who knew Seattle had an underground bus system, and it was free to the ballpark? Will stay here again.

That is, we didn't choose the place terribly carefully. My wife needed a certain corporate rate for a business trip, she brought the family, we didn't do as much research as we otherwise might for a business-plus-pleasure-bring-the-family trip. First impressions count for a lot, and the Warwick really bit the big one here. I've never stayed anywhere so militant about its check in time, particularly one so slack as 3:00 p.m. We flew in from the east coast and arrived at 11:30 a.m. or so. No room available. We were told to check back in two hours. We came back at 2:15 or so and had to sit until 3:01 to get our room. The front desk staff were not only unconcerned, but barely masked their mild amusement at our inconvenience. The lobby was full of people in the same situation. The lobby was small and beat up, and managed to look like a refugee camp for much of the time we were there. Slow elevators aggravated the conditions. After the abysmal welcome, the mediocre room was rather refreshing. But the plumbing was poor. The faucets mustered barely a trickle, and the tub drain was slow. The TV was a traditional 4:3 job, placed rather low in a console so you can't see it well in the bed, kind of hidden behind your feet. We were on the 5th floor, facing a bus stop, which was hugely noisy. It was as if the room acoustics were tuned to the bus engines. They start running at about 5 a.m. during the week; mercifully later on the weekend. That said. The location is excellent. Convenient to convention center, Pike Place market, waterfront, Seattle Center, and surrounded by worthy restaurants. The bar in the hotel isn't bad. An upscale market across the street gets you all you need (except fresh bread) at nearly any hour. There's a refridgerator in the room. The Cinerama across the street has a cool retro look to it, and there's a view of the Space needle. The street scene is fun to watch. Beyond the few rotten apples at the front desk, the bell and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional. Consistent with the late check-in time, the noon check-out time is rather generous. The pool/whirlpool is fine for a quick dip, and the gym looked O.K., too. We got the sense that the Warwick does a high-volume tourist business associated with the cruise ship terminals not far away. I suppose the hotel is appropriate for that market; a place to crash before embarking on a cruise or making an airport connection with perhaps a few hours to see a bit of Seattle's sights. The Warwick is definitely not a business class hotel, but perhaps it's unfair to hold it to that standard. Whatever the application, there are no doubt much better places to stay in Seattle. At the right price (a very low one), I would not discourage someone from staying at the Warwick. But I would not recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117675030">We love the location. You are within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and downtown shopping. Easy cab ride to the cruise ship terminals. The staff was very attentive. Nice amenities (restaurant, fitness room and pool). The rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall glass exterior window walls that provide great views. Light sleepers (which we are not) may find these window walls provide the background sounds of the city a little too much. We will return the next time we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117478321">Everytime I read reviews here, for wherever I travel, I hear horror stories and get a little worried and then when I get there I think "What was all the complaining about???' We travelled from Vancouver to Seattle by car with our 7 year old son. WE got room 609 which worried me as it was by the elevators but that was not a problem. We had a room on the 6th floor and although they assured me over the phone (while I reserved,) that it was a NON VIEW room (we paid a very reasonable price and were expecting nothing) we had a view of the Space Needle (wee photo from our room)! While we reserved over the phone they guy on the line said "You are aware this is a non view room???" IF that was a non view room, Im impressed! WE loved looking at the space needle at night. Cool! The room was moderately decorated and very clean. Lots of pillows! Carpets looked brand new. Bathroom was standard and had a kick-butt blowdryer for my long hair. A few hotels near the Warwick were double the price per night and I imagine they were top of the line. This place was great for what we needed it for. The beds were a little soft for my back but the place was spotless and comfy. The noise. Ok, so you are in Seattle in the middle of the city. You will hear sirens, trucks etc. Bring earplugs and you will be just fine. If you are not a light sleeper, the noises are not that bad. If you want complete quiet, go camping in a forest. The location was great. We walked everywhere (with our 7 year old)....the space needle, the market, shopping..... and he never complained that it was "too far". The location of the Warwick is great. The restaurant in the hotel was pricey but good for breakfast. There is a funky deli/market across the street where were would get drinks and cool pastries from. We enjoyed the pool. Again, the complaints on here are silly. You want an olympic sized pool in the heart of Seattle? The pool was nice and warm and clean and I could stay in the hot tub while my son swam because they were adjacent. It was a nice place to go unwind after a day of sightseeing. IF you need to do some hard core laps then it would be too small but for a soak and a small swim it is great. The gym was small too but it was being used and the people in it were sweating and getting a work out. We didnt like that we had to pay $27 a day for parking. That, in my opinion, made the hotel more expensive than they told us it would be. Wondering if all hotels charge for parking?? Liked the free internet in the lobby computer room to quickly check my emails post of facebook :) I would definatley stay at the Warwick again. They just need harder beds for my liking but otherwise it was fantastic. If you are going to the space needle, go to Zeeks Pizza, it was to die for!

We had an issue with an ex s/o continuously finding his ways back into locked rooms after key cards had been changed. Security did a half hearted attempt to look around the room and failed to find the intruder twice. After notification of the front desk the response was not prompt, and only after several completely frightening experiences and numerous phone calls were the police called. The hotel overall is old, so understandably outdated, but the beds were not comfortable and housekeeping not prompt. The happy hour was great, but otherwise the food extremely overpriced for what was served. Because of the situation with the lack of security I was too frightenend to leave my room for the remainder of the trip, resulting in ruining my only free day to explore Seattle. The manager was aware and while apologetic, there was no followup of the result of the lack of security, nor any incentives for us to come back. Just cold reception.

In fact don't go there at all! We arrived fairly late on Tuesday night and were given our room keys but when arriving in our rooms we found that they were both on the smoking floor and stunk to high heaven of cigarettes. We went back to reception and asked to have our rooms changed only to be told that there were no non smoking rooms available at the price we paid and that if we wanted a non smoking room we would have to pay extra. We were also told that as we had booked through an agent there was no guarantee of room type (i.e. smoking or non smoking) and that this could only be guaranteed if we had book with the hotel directly. Having explained how bad the room was and that as non smokers we could not be expected to sleep in a smoking room we asked to be moved again and it was like banging our heads against a brick wall. All we got from the night duty manager was that it was their policy not to move customers to other rooms free of charge (we were talking $10 difference by the way) and that she understood our problem which clearly she did not. She would not budge and just kept going on about hotel policy and the fact that she would get in trouble if she gave us upgraded non smoking room free of charge. After 20 minutes of complete frustration we reluctantly agreed to pay the extra $10. And what did we get for that $10, well the room was on a higher floor but not as big or nicely laid out as the previous room, my brother ended up with twin beds rather than a double and our room had a bathroom with facilities for a disabled person. Note also a lot of their rooms are on the main road and can be very noisy (we stayed there for 2 nights 2 weeks before when we did get non smoking rooms) but noisy ones.

The staff are always welcoming (every time I've walked in at 6am with no reservation they've immediately booked me in for the following night, no problem), the narrow balconies all have interesting views and they put me in the same room every time I visit which is really nice. Pros: The location is unbeatable for tourists wishing to shop and check out Seattle's main attractions. The onsite restaurant is truly delicious, albeit expensive (during happy hour at the bar there are some decent deals) and directly across the street from the hotel there is a small grocery with excellent ready to eat dishes (it's open until 2am and a bit pricier than most). Cons: The basement amenities leave something to be desired. The pool is not nearly as sparkling and long as it appears in the photo on the brochure, the fitness center is a bit small and the hot tub is rarely functional. The best thing about the Warwick is the staff, they have a certain cool worldly attitude that you don't tend to see in Seattle. They are neither nosy or disinterested, and respond quickly and appropriately to issues. Our toilet flooded during our stay and they immediately moved us to a nicer room on the 17th floor.

They said they would not guarantee room type through third parties and if we wanted a non-smoking room it would cost an additional $30 per night. We paid the "upgrade" after they advised they would not give us any other options. It was also clear that the staff had some battle going on as they were not nice with the people checking in or the people that came to the front desk for assistance.

The carpet, and furniture were new, but they hadn't done anything in the bathroom (door had big chunks missing out of the bottom, faucet had obvious signs of wear, water stains on the marble tile) and, worst of all, the sliding glas door opening to the balcony was so poorly hung, we didn't dare open it again once we got it shut the first time. Additionally - while the floor-to-celing windows provide a great view, they are poorly insulated and the noise coming up from the street during the night made it difficult to sleep - and we were exhausted from our trip. The Warwick is in a great location, but Hotel Andra is right next door and the Warwick suffers in comparison. If the view is most important to you, stay at Warwick; if its the quality of the room, go to Andra.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113666813">The Warwick hotel was in a fabulous location. It was walking distance from the Space Needle and Pike Market. The problem with the hotel is that it looks like it has not been updated in several decades. The decor is very dated, the rooms still have tube televisions, and it has an old feel to it. The hotel is clean, so there are no complaints there. I would recommend staying here if you are on a budget, but otherwise, I would say head elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113394864">We arrived at the Hotel for a one night stay prior to taking a cruise. Difficult to find anything positive about this hotel. Reception run down and 'tatty' looking. Despite the presence of a concierge/porter there was no offer to help with our bags. As soon as we entered our assigned room we were amazed - and not in a positive way. The bathroom was so small that the washbasin was in the room - even the smallest cabin on the ship (144 sq ft.) managed to get this in the bathroom. The room was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and the sheets were rumpled and appeared not to have been changed since the last occupant. We immeditely booked another hotel by phone and left, informing reception of our dissatisfaction. Even if we had been offered another room we would have not stayed there under any circumstances. I am not usually so negative about reviews but this was the worst place for it's star rating we have ever been in. The 'additional details/ratings' are so sketchy as th hotel was in our opinion so bad we did not actually stay there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR112095939">We stayed at the Warwick for two nights after an Alaskan cruise. We stayed there basically because we could get a smoking room. The hotel was only a $15 cab ride from Pier 91 and we arrived at 10.00 am so we went for a walk to the Space Needle which took about 15 minutes slowly. Our room was ready by 12.30 and was great. Naturally there was some smoke smell but we have had worse in supposed non smoking hotels. We were on the ninth floor looking toward the needle. The beds were 5 star standard and we had a bath as well. There is a free computer room downstairs so I din not check out the wifi. There were lots of places to eat nearby and a subway 50 yards away. The staff were very friendly and competent and the concierge Joe knew everything about Seattle. We paid about $150 per night which we thought was very good value. We will be back. We should have stayed three nights as one day was not enough at The Museum of Flight which would be of interest to everybody not just flying enthusiasts.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR111560985">Modern room, good large bed, nice view of the hi-rise city from 14th floor. Sliding glass doors to small balcony allowed fresh air in. Odd layout with 'bathroom' having only bath, shower and wc; no mirror or basin. The washbasin and mirrors are in the bedroom. It felt strange shaving, brushing teeth, etc., in the bedroom, and having no mirror in the bathroom. The double room had only one office-style chair, although there was room for more. WiFi was charged; only 2 free terminals in the "business centre" off the lobby. One was out of order.

Overall, If honest, after an eight day stay at this hotel I may consider a more recently refurbished, new hotel.... this is not to say our time at this hotel was bad, if anything it was very pleasant, but there are little things here and there that could be improved upon (including a luke warm, bubbless jacuzzi)....

The person in charge of group reservations was great and had eveything completely ready for us when we arrived, including individual key envelopes with each person's name on it.

It's the location- downtown but also easy walking distance to Seattle Center/Space Needle, Pikes Place, Westwood underground bus station if you want to go to other areas. Beranoya Hall, theaters, restaurants, shopping, monorail, just a great location. Easy to get to. Spotlessly clean. Comfy bed. Juliet balcony with sliding glass door, so it was light and airy. Really nice bath products, deep tub. I like the restaurant, reasonable bill, sensible portions, nice flavors. The surprise gift of a plate of macaroons and mineral water, and lovely turn down service after returning from evenings out made me feel especially well cared for. Parking seems a bit steep, but I think it's comparable to independent lot parking, and it is covered parking. The mini fridge wasn't cold enough, but I've never seen one that is.

We stayed this time because we had reservations at Jazz Alley, a short walk away. Overall, the hotel is old &amp; tired, but fairly well maintained. The rooms are average, bathrooms are marble (reflecting their age) &amp; pretty small. The ceilings in the bathroom have been lowered in a remodel from the 1960s or so, making them rather claustrophobic. Water pressure was terrible. The TV was in a large cabinet facing the bed, but was so low you had to sit up in the bed to see it. The bed was OK, the towels &amp; sheets were very tired. The sheets were thin &amp; shabby, &amp; there was a hole in the bottem sheet. One thin blanket on the bed -- thank goodness they had a spare in the closet. The towels were similar -- pretty bad. We didn't eat in the restaurant this time, but we did have drinks &amp; dessert in the bar. After 2 drinks I wasn't convinced there was any liquor in them. The dessert was described as multiple layers of chocolate torte. It was a tasteless cold concoction sitting on top of Ready Whip, drizzled with raspberry syrup. Terrible. The bartender nicely took it off our tab. All &amp; all, we've decided the low price is just not worth it, &amp; next time we'll stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR93088705">Staff very helpful and location was most convenient.

OK, what was wrong? The window wall is two sets of sliding glass doors that admit lots of street noise and serious drafts- on a cold, rainy night that was a big negative. The room's decor was black and gold, circa 1972 vintage Holiday Inn- gross, dated and depressing. The hallways were worse. In fairness to the hotel, they are in the process of renovating. In fairness to you, understand that a 'standard' room is a to be avoided, unrenovated room. Based on my view of the public areas and my room, I would rate the hotel 2 stars. Having experienced it, I would pay a lot more money to stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR87619358">This is my favourite place to stay when in Seattle.

The white curtains had obvious brown stains on it and all in all it looked like they tried to remodel it but it's more like putting lipstick on a pig.

Staff was all very friendly and helpful, but room was a tremendous disappointment. Very dated, uncomfortable beds and not up to standard for cleanliness. Our "Space Needle" view room also overlooked the roof of the theatre next door and all its HVAC units - not attractive at all, but Space Needle was in the distance. Worst part was the noise from the street both nights we stayed - people yelling and whistling; honking horns; etc. until after 3am both nights. It was reasonably convenient to most sites, but in the middle of the monorail route - would have been better to stay on one end or the other to make travel easier.

At one point the hotel staff gave us a lesson on electronic keys as if they were talking to five year olds. The bathtub was dirty. There were used toiletries in the tub, complete with someone else's hair stuck to them and the bottom of the tub. When housekeeping arrived to take care of the issue she didn't knock when entering the room and then proceeded to tell us she had already cleaned the bathroom. She then removed the used items, after they were pointed out, and simply rinsed the hair out of the tub. That is not cleaning. The location of this hotel is decent. It's walking distance to just about everything downtown has to offer and if you can't walk there it puts you a short distance from all public transportation. We did have a great view of the Space Needle, but even that isn't enough to make up for poor customer service and lack of cleanliness. I debated chaning hotels all together, but there were several big events in Seattle that weekend and I wasn't going to be able to get another room on such short notice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81687575">When we originally booked our trip to Seattle we only booked the first night at the Warwick (as it was a bit cheaper), but when we arrived I was really impressed. The hotel itself doesn't exactly look amazing from outside but the staff were really friendly on arrival and our room was brilliant. It seemed really big (I don't know if this is just an American thing) and we had a prefect view of the Space Needle. The other side of the hotel faces downtown so whichever side you're on the view should be alright. We were really tired after our flight but we did venture downstairs to the bar / restaurant for a few drinks before bed. Again the staff were really friendly and the food in the restaurant looked good (although we didn't actually have anything). The prices all seemed pretty reasonable. The following morning we were off to get on our cruise to Alaska and would be coming back to stay in the Fairmont Olympic one week later. In all honesty, even though the Fairmont was a 5 star hotel, I would have quite happily just gone back to the Warwick, it definitely had everything we needed. The location is pretty good, most things are easily in walking distance - especially the restaurants and shops of downtown. Pike street market is only about 5 minutes away and I would definitely recommend you give that a visit.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81329283">I stayed for two nights and was generally pleased. I selected this hotel because the rates are very reasonable, they are on the Grayline Airporter route for convenient ground travel, and they have smoking rooms. The staff was all very pleasant and helpful. The room was large, clean, and comfortable. The only downside for me was the walk from the Monorail station back to the hotel after dark, which is not the hotel's fault.

Finally get the room key, to find out on top of the over $200 / night stay I had to pay an additional $30 just to park over night in their garage! Being as it was an hour wait to get the key, my husband had already been directed to park the car, on level 6, with no elevator, so when i got out of the line we had to walk up 7 floors empty our car and carry ALL of it down the stairs to take to our room! Even though I was told "valet" parking and luggage would be included in the price of parking. Get to our room, the key did not work. Thankfully there were 2, and the other did. The room was ok. The furniture and bed was nice, SMALL old tv, nasty bathroom, and it a constant "buzzing" sound from the water running on the floor above us. Got zero sleep. Paid nearly $300 to spend less than 10 hours in a loud, dirty hotel with NO extras. No coffee in room, no refridgerator in room (other than the locked mini bar fridge), No continental breakfast, over all: So not worth it!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR75510460">we just got back stayed in room 410 the view was a cement wall!

It was the lowest price in this location...and the location is wonderful! Walking distance to absolutely everything you could possibly want to do - or if not, you could catch public transportation to get wherever you want to go! We arrived very early in the AM - post-cruise. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. She went the extra mile to get us a room and allowed an early check in! Fantastic, as we certainly didn't expect it! The hotel has an historic elegance, our bed was very comfortable, room was clean and quiet - in-room mini-bar fridge didn't work. They offered free internet access in their business center - so, we were able to check in and print our boarding passes for our flight home. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with any and all questions that we asked. Concierge assisted beautifully in booking a town car to the airport for us. I would highly suggest using the town car service. It's not much more than the shuttle service - and you don't have to lug your own suitcases. The driver was extremely punctual, professional and courteous. I have read on TripAdvisor of other people encountering difficulties with shuttle service, etc not being on time and such - so, definitely need to do the town car via the concierge! All in all - a very nice stay, though I would say we usually do not stay in hotels that are in this price range...but, it is just the price of staying in this area of Seattle. It's very close to Pike Place Market and lots of great shopping - and that is definitely worth something!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72189263">We hit Seattle late (5 in the evening), and tried a few places, landing at the Warwick, an old friend.

Our room was not well-kept (a beer bottle cap on the floor; grout in the bathroom was filthy; furniture and coverlet with stains); the balcony door was left open; the mattresses had long since seen better days.

Entrance does not have automatic doors, and there's no one to help with bags and luggage in the evening. Front desk staff was friendly and gave us a tourist map. Concierge would only give detailed directions and advice when face-to-face and not when calling from the hotel room phone. Room was spacious and had a great view of the Space Needle. Curtains were old and stained. Bed was fairly comfortable and had nice linens. Temperature control and air conditioning were in good working condition. Bathroom did not have a fan, so all the mirrors were fogged up for a long time after a shower. The shower head was installed low, so tall people would have to bend over to wash their hair. Shampoo, soap, body wash, and lotion were provided. Closet contained functional iron and ironing board. Also had a very small in-room safe. The old TV had some trouble responding to the remote control. The mini-fridge/bar required a key from the front desk, and if you wanted to store your own items, you had to rearrange the items within the bar (even with rearrangement, very little space for your own things). No microwave. Housekeepers came in daily to make the bed and hang up the towels, but other than that, did not do much cleaning. Overall, decor was outdated, and furnishings need some updating. Wireless internet cost $11/day. Complimentary business center with 2 computers and a printer. Restaurant was very pricey ($10 for juice, coffee, and a pastry) and had no bathroom. Touted itself as a higher-end hotel but really needed some more updating and better amenities. You can definitely hear the buses and trucks going by (even above the 10th floor), so if you are a light sleeper, beware. Also, although the room was a non-smoking room, the vents must be connected to a smoking room, because I smelled smoke one morning in the bathroom.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR67217618">At 11:30am on 5-18-10 while traveling from San Francisco to Seattle on a important business trip, I learned my Father was suddenly rushed to ICU in South Florida.

Warwick Hotel assured me my room would be ready and even said Mr. James Harker, General Manager, would promptly inform all his staff. After 2pm I arrived at the Warwick &amp; my room was Not Ready nor was any of the Warrick Staff informed. Mr. Harker was unavailable. I then told Mr. Robert Smartt, Reservations Manager, who was the most cold, uncaring, inhospitable hospitality worker I ever met of my situation. He never once expressed any concern for me while scrounging up a room. My father passed away on 5-20-10, my final day at Hotel Warwick. I let Robert Smart know that except for housekeeping, to give me some privacy.

This was my first trip to Seattle, so I really had no idea what to expect. What I liked about the hotel: comfortable bed and pillows, really tasty food options for room service, cabs parked outside for easy/quick transportation, accessible by Gray Line from airport, professional staff, view of Space Needle. What I didn't like: no fridge/microwave in room, small bathroom, vending machines available only in basement, $11/day unsecured almost-never-functional WiFi, insufficient sound barrier for street noise (even though I was 16 floors up) and adjoining room, no fan to create white noise at night, location was too far from touristy stuff to walk to it (at least as a woman alone). I ventured out one night to find dinner, and was no more than two blocks away before I was greeted by the city's homeless population... ended that journey pretty quickly.

Hello universal check in time is 3:00pm and check out 11:00am or 12noon!!!!! Most hotels (especially cruise hotels) let you purchase an early check-in and no its not a cash grab its because every one getting off your boat is asking for early check-in as well so this fairest way to allocate this. I found the staff to find the right answers they were in no way 5 diamond but were professional, management were just a little aloof but all in all nothing to complain about.

My room was very clean, especially the bed and bathroom area. And I am fussy about these things. The hotel is just on the edge of downtown, 3 minutes walk to Macy's, 10 Minutes to Pike St. Market. The "Downtown Airporter" express bus service to SEA-TAC Intl. stops at the hotel (on 3rd. Ave.) every 30 Minutes - perfect and at 11$ much cheaper than the cabs at $45. The price is very reasonable for the area. However, the Warwick is not a hotel you visit because you want to spend time in the hotel proper. It is very much somewhere where you sleep and shower, maybe watch a bit of TV or check your emails. I would stay there again, but only if travelling alone. I wouldn't bring a family here, not a hotel for hanging out in. The furnishings were several years old, and showed their age. The bathroom was smallish, nothing chipped or cracked, but nothing new either. For example, the shower / bath tap (faucet) worked perfectly well, if you found just the right position to balance the settings on. The TV cabinet (huge) was neither pretty, quite worn, but entirely utilitarian. The big window out on to the very tiny (20cm) balcony didn't shut tightly, causing quite some draughtiness. The air conditioning / heating worked exceptionally well and balanced out the draught from the window nicely. The staff were effiicient and courteous - perfect. All in all a very acceptable, no fuss, no th(fr)rills, competent and efficient - if aging - hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58639237">I stay in downtown Seattle several times each year in one of several hotels which are within a few blocks of each other. So, location is not a factor. This weekend we booked at the last minute and couldn't get in at any of our normal hotels, so booked a night at the Warwick because the price appeared right and the reviews were good. I am not picky. I am actually quite content to stay at a decent Motel 6. However, this was one of my worst lodging experiences, and I have done a lot of traveling. Let me preface the review by stating that you can have a worse experience by staying at hotels/motels for half the price. I just expect that an establishment that charges for rooms starting in the mid-100s will have a few things right. OK, here is what I liked: - The location was fine. It was right within a few blocks of pretty much everything downtown. - The ambience was good. It is a nice-looking older hotel. - The room was sized a bit on the smallish side, but more or less as expected. - The price was good (though better value can be had downtown at other hotels). - When I booked online, I was given a dollar amount with tax. This is EXACTLY what appeared on my bill. This is usually not the case. - The deal we got included parking (which can be a big deal in downtown Seattle). That's a good thing because parking there is $27 a day. Here is what I didn't like: - Check-in was rough. I had booked online through Warwick's own website, but it took 15-20 minutes and a phone call to the reservations manager for them to find our reservation. Not a huge deal. I realize these things happen. - Internet access was an additional $11 per day. Frankly, I would have rather them charge $11 more for the room and throw in internet access for free. Paying extra for internet access didn't sit well with me for a hotel of this sort. - The TV had about 8-10 local channels, and that was all. Anything else was extra. I have seen this before, but usually only in a low-end hotel/motel. - They put us on the third floor (very near the street noise), about 15 feet from the elevator, and right next to an adjoining room with a screaming baby. OK, I get that they were near full capacity, but we couldn't have had a much worse room. - I am not a light sleeper, but hardly slept all night from the street noise. The sound insulation of the windows near street-level needs to be upgraded. We found very little sound difference whether the window was opened or closed - and it is a noisy street. - Both of our beds had a strange short fitted sheet that didn't cover the whole bed. This left our feet to rest directly on the mattress. Very odd. - After finally getting to sleep, housekeeping showed up very early and woke us up. - Under the light of day, I found red stains here and there (on the curtain, mattress, etc.) At first, these appeared as blood, but I realized they were ink or paint. Still, not pleasant to find. I have spent about 200 nights in hotels and motels, and can count the experiences I consider negative on one hand. This was one of them. The hotel itself was OK. I think that the experience may largely depend on the room selection. We got a terrible room, but I don't have the impression that all rooms were that bad. Still my recommendation is to stay at any of the comparably priced hotels within a few blocks of the Warwick. They are all better deals.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR58421378">The Warwick was so much cheaper then all the other hotels we considered in downtown Seattle. We were skeptical, but it had great reviews, so we booked. The Warwick truly is an awesome deal! Very nice looking on the inside, rooms are nicely decorated, and views of the Space Needle are an extreme value for money! The Warwick is within walking distance of pretty much everything. Even the monorail is close...oh and Macy's! The parking is expensive, but I believe this is the case in all downtown hotels within large cities. We loved everything about the Warwick, with the exception of the high speed internet...its not free...they tried to charge over $10 per day for it! Honestly, this is so common now...this should be an included amenity at all hotels. Even Super 8 offers it for free! Other then that we loved the Warwick and will definitely be staying here again when we come back to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58308722">The Warwick Seattle is a great value for a hotel in downtown Seattle. The hotel public areas and hotel rooms are clean and decent. The building has been kept up in good shape as have the rooms. Higher floors get some view of the city or the Space Needle, depending on which way you face. After two stays here I've found the staff friendly and very accommodating.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58082514">My husband and I took a last minute trip to Seattle and found a low rate for the Warwick on Hotels.com. I had read mixed reviews before we left but being that it was noted as a 3 1/2 star hotel in a great location, we decided to check it out. We were uncomfortable from the first moment we walked in. The lobby, elevators, and room were a mix of mold, body odor, and smoke smells. The location was not as great as we expected - most other downtown hotels (Westin, Sheraton, Marriott) are closer to Pike Place Market, Aquarium, Pier 59, Pioneer Square, etc. The bathroom floor and shower tiles were cracked and the grout was covered in mold. The worst part was that there was not a mattress pad on the bed and the sheets were very thin, so you felt like you were sleeping directly on an old mattress. We asked for extra sheets each night to cover the bed and give it more padding just so we could sleep. This hotel is older, poorly maintained, and overall disappointing. My suggestion - get a 4-star hotel on Hotwire.com in the downtown/Pike Place area. It probably won't cost much more.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR57344240">Lady and I stayed at the Warwick Hotel in downton Seattle in September. We loved it! It's older and it had tons of character. We loved opening up the sliding glass door to walk out on to the balcony. We loved being in the middle of all the action too. Pike's place was only a couple blocks away. Bring your walking shoes!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR56818581">We found this hotel on the internet after doing some research for a hotel with a good location in Seattle. We didn't want to rent a car so the location of this hotel was great. We were able to walk to Pike's, the Needle and all sorts of restaurants and shopping. By the way, there is an excellent italian restaurant just a half block up from the Warwick, Assaggio's, it's a must do! But for $88/night we got a room with a city view on the 15th floor. They even accommodated us to be right across the hall from family members who we met there for the weekend. The decor is a little dated and it could use some updating. But we had one of the best experiences there with the friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56722752">I had read in the reviews that rooms that they allocate for some "best-rates" in the internet can face a wall. This is exactly what happened to us in our weekend get-away. We booked our room on expedia for 99$ and we were given a room on the 4th floor which they said was a "corner room": facing the wall of the parking garage next door. Well, we had to go and ask for another room and we did get another one on the sixth floor, this time, facing not the wall of the garage, but the garage itself.. So, it might be better to spend a bit more and get a Space needle view room. Otherwise as you check in you might want to ask for a room on level 7 or above. Otherwise, the hotel staff was helpful and they did end up changing our room. The room itself was clean and spacious enough. The bathroom was also nice, it was all marble. No mini-bar but a refrigerator if you want to keep some food in there. Walking distance to pretty much everything unless you are lazy. And if you are lazy, there is always a cab waiting in front of the hotel for a 5 bucks ride to Space Needle. They charge $11 for using the internet (24 hours period). So, if you can avoid one of those rooms facing the wall (levels 4 and 5) or almost at the same level with the parking garage (level 6) then you should be fine. We would probably stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56661559">Seattle has lots of terrific 4-star Hotel choices. The Warwick just isn't one. The rooms all have balconies (11 inches of standing space for a late-night cigarette), nice sheets and marble baths. Those are the pros. The hotel is also conveniently located downtown. On the down side, the hotel is astonishingly dirty, worn and tired. I'm not a princess, but the abundant food/liquor/coffee/barf stains on the furniture and carpet throughout the common areas are overwhelming. The walls themselves are grimy, in the elevator, in the halls and to some degree in the rooms. The service staff exemplifies this same description: worn and tired. They are all nice enough, but they have little reason to be especially enthusiastic about the product their representing. For some reason it has been given a 4 star rating by SOME entity that clearly has never been there. It is completely sub-par at that level of expectation, but to its credit, if you're a tourist in Seattle, on a budget, looking for convenience and an 11 inch balcony, then bring your anti-bacterial wipes and stay at the Warwick.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR55725956">While it may not be the most hip, luxurious hotel in Seattle, I found the Warwick Hotel to be an amazing value for the money. I got a great deal on their website and found the location to be perfect. About 3 blocks up from Pike Place market, you can walk to everything from this hotel. There is even an airport shuttle that picks up from this location to get you back to the airport for $11. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was slightly dated but beds and bath were excellent. The only problem that I had with this place was that the sliding doors are older and let in cigarette smoke from below and sounds from the street. If the person had not been on their tiny balcony having a cigarette, I don't think this would have been an issue. Overall, it is an amazing value for the money. I even left a power cord in my room by accident and one call to the hotel put me in touch with the lost &amp; found dept. They packaged up my power cord and had it delivered to my door step in MA in only two days! Now that's service. I would definitely stay here again. There is even a pool, spa and workout room that all looked very nice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR53937185">First off, you rarely see marble like this in Hotels anymore. It reminded me of a nice boutique hotel we stayed in, in Athens, Greece. Maybe being from New Orleans I have learned to appreciate the preservation of things built well. The hotel is within walking distance of everything in the downtown area. The staff was great and upgraded us to a room with a view of the space needle which is a perfect view from the Warwick. I love the fact that you can open the big sliding glass doors to the outside something else you rarely see in a Hotel anymore, windows that open! Other places were much more expensive I'm glad I picked the Warwick.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR53908009">I have stayed at the Warwick for many years. It is very well priced for all that you get. Location is excellent. Close to everything. The staff always goes above and beyond. The food is fantastic, most rooms have a great view. We always get a room looking directly at the Space Needle. If you smoke they are one of the few hotels left that allows smoking. Which in all fairness to the smokers, I believe that it is your right to smoke and if you are paying the price for a room, they should all have smoking rooms available. Equal rights, we all know that Seattle prides it self on that .. The Warwick is the best value for the price in all of Seattle. It is true that the parking is 27 dollars, but there is a public lot across the street. Most hotels in the area charge more then that. They have a very nice pool and spa area. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to our city.As for the noise, all hotels in the city have noise. That is just the way it is in the city.

Thus on this trip my wife and I decided to try the Warwick, even though there were some negative reviews on some of the travel web-sites, there were more positive reviews. During and after our stay, my wife and I fully agreed that we were extremely satisfied with our stay. There was absolutely nothing that could have justified any level of dissatisfaction. The room was immediately upgraded at check-in due to the scheduled room not being ready, the room itself was quite comfortable, immaculately kept, and had a very impressive view, the entire staff was extremely helpful and pleasant, the food in the restaurant was great, and the central location was perfect for our entertainment events, my meetings, and the close-in walk around option to all of downtown. I highly recommend the facility and we will be back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR49291043">The Warwick is an average hotel in a great location. The service is always very good; the rooms are very average - nothing terrible, just an "old" feel to everything. Like the hotel could use a great makeover someday soon! But it's located directly across the street from my offices (I live in Denver but my company is based here in Seattle). You've got the view of the Space Needle, a "smoking" floor, and very good service. The downstairs restaurant, Margaux, is very good, too. I could stay at other hotels when I'm in town, but they're all more expensive and further away from "work." So I usually opt for the Warwick. Most times I have a cheese and fruit tray waiting on me upon arrival. So it's a comfortable business alternative. Not sure I'd recommend it for vacationing families, though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR48830935">My wife and I stayed at the Warwick Seattle the night of November 7th. The rooms are pretty nice, but the walls are not good for sound proofing. In the room next door, the guests there had 3 LOUD quarrels that kept us up. Apparently, the police were called and at 4:15AM they finally quieted. While the hotel is not to blame for their quarrel, they should at least have tried to make it up to the guests that were inconvenienced. Thinking that they would at least apologize was my thought, but no such luck. When i brought it up to the desk clerk at check out, she merely agreed that it was loud and sent us on our way. Terrible customer service!

It was the first time I have used them to book a hotel. I received a rate of $156 including fees and taxes. I found the front desk staff nice and friendly. They were having issues getting the rooms keys working with the computer system so she had the bell hop show me to my room and let me in. The room was very dreary and faced a large cement wall. The bedding looked like it was from the 1970's or from a Thrift Store. I walked went back to the front desk and spoke to the friendly woman and asked if all the rooms are like this. She said that because I booked with Hotwire - Hotwire only gets certain rooms, but she switched me to a different room and said to book directly with them to ensure a nicer room. This room was higher level with views of the Space Needle. I enjoyed the view. The bedding was the same as the previous room still the Thrift Store feel. The fitness center is good, 1 nice ellyptical, treadmill, stair climber and bike. They do have a pool but I did not use it. I did like the location and it was close to shopping and the Space Needle. I guess if you need a budget hotel stay here. I love the Inn at Harbor Steps and my husband likes the Alexis Hotel. Bigger price difference but the rooms are so much nicer. My husband stayed at the Alexis for just over $200 including taxes and fees and I think it is worth the difference.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR39274473">My husband stayed here for three nights, I was here for two, and we both walked away thinking it was the right choice. Our room on the 3rd floor had a VERY small (walk out, but couldn't turn around) balcony that overlooked the Space Needle, which was beautiful at night. The hotel also has their hotel offices on the 3rd floor (right outside of our room) which seemed a little odd but it didn't disturb us at all. The king-sized bed had four pillows plus an accent pillow, and there was a comfy chair in the corner as well as a desk and chair. As others have mentioned the location is great, within walking distance to all major attractions. The front desk staff were helpful but we did notify them - twice - that our coffee pot was not operational yet no one ever came to replace/repair it (perhaps they were thinking who would really want to drink coffee in a hotel room in Seattle?!;). The grocery store across the street was very nice, but pretty expensive. Would highly recommend Assaggio's Restaurant just outside of the hotel. Nice hotel, would recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR35888246">We simply needed a decent room to crash for a Saturday night, and our only requirements were a non-smoking room and a king bed, and got a decent (not smoking) rate through Hotwire. When we arrived, we confirmed the latter, and reiterated verbally "and that is non-smoking, right?" to Ivy, the receptionist. For reason I cannot fathom, she ignored my statement and gave me "the last room available" which was on the smoking floor. The hotel was also full of partiers, and I spotted four of them going into the adjacent room, which is a recipe for disaster on top of the pervasive stale smoke. Ivy was so helpful to find us another room at another hotel, we said great, make this happen and she so kindly informed us "well, here's the number, you can call and make a reservation" -- they were not going to help us in anyway. The attitude was arrogant and indifferent. They just fell back to the fact that we were lowlife Hotwire customers and there was nothing they needed to do about it. The two minutes I spent in the room while waiting for my husband to finish parking the car (before he knew about this fiasco), I was completely unimpressed by everything but the view. Old World Charm? If you like slow elevators, maybe. I thought we were due for a Langham-type experience, and it was a complete let-down. Totally overhyped. One positive - location.

"Robert Smart" the person with whom I spoke in Seattle, said there was no availability AT THE TIME I MADE THE RESERVATION. He implied it was somehow my fault because I made the reservation only 2 1/2 days in advance. He was unapologetic and argumentative. When I called the off-site reservation center -- IN BRAZIL- they, too were no help.

Me and a friend stayed at the Warwick for two nights to sight-see in Seattle before moving on to Vancouver. When we arrived the gentleman at the front desk was really helpful in helping us park the car and even offered us valet service, however the lady that checked us in I felt could've been a little bit more welcoming but dont see this as a major detriment of the hotel - purely a reflection on her own personality! The room was ready on arrival which seems to be a rareity when reading some of the other reviews, however ours was lovely and clean with freshly made beds, tea and coffee making facilities and bottles of water available (at an additional cost but the thought was there!) We also had a breath taking view of Seattle which only got better as the evening set in as the Space Needle lit up and looked amazing! The location of the hotel was GREAT as a starting point for sight seeing! If you turn left out the main entrance and then turn left again at the corner you will come to a stop for the city's open top bus tour! It cost us approximately $20 for the ticket but I think that could possibly have been a two day pass! Whatever it was it was excellent value as the tour takes you all around Seattle and if you have limited time like we did then it is a good idea to do this! You can also jump off the bus at the designated stops to explore that area further if you wish at no extra cost when getting back on later. Also if you turn right out of the hotel and left onto 4th then right again at Virginia Street and carry on walking it takes you right to the sea front and to Pike Place Market - the walk takes approx 10 - 15 mins but it's really nice - especially if you are fortunate to get hot weather like we did! On our return from sightseeing we took advantage of the free swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna which was wonderful. It was so quiet and tranquil and the facility is really well maintained. There are towels down there and chairs where you can just relax. It was also very secluded so it felt like your own personal space which was fantastic! There was also a gym facility however we didnt use that but from the outside it looked ok. Finally on check-out the receptionist (a different one) was very friendly and helpful making checkout easy. Also the night before I had wanted to send a postcard home however the first receptionist's knowledge of where I could buy a stamp/post my card was very very minimal. Upon checkout the new receptionist was very helpful in advising me they would take care of the postage of my card for the charge of $1 and also offered me some complimentary postcards advertising Seattle and The Warwick with free postage that they would sort out for me... needless to say I took advantage of this and sent quite a few home to various members of my friends and family!!

The room was drafty and it faced the parking lot and construction site which was noisy. The bed and the bed linens looked and felt like they were from the original days of George Washington. Shabby and nasty. The tv was antiquated, the stations limited. No fridge, small towels and never enough of them. Parking was almost 30 dollars a night and internet was exorbitant as well. The pool was nothing to write home about and the fitness room was .,. limited as well. all in all i would say that if it were the last hotel in Seattle I would sooner camp out.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22696924">Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub. The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime and people had taken to scratching profanities into it. Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides. The hot-tub was luke warm at best and just like the pool it was filthy. We informed the desk about both the pool and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should. These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money. A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day. The rooms themselves were adequate although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains. The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field. This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep but you do not worry too much about quality. If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21161140">This is a bait &amp; switch type of place. We stayed there before our cruise to Alaska, and I called from Pennsylvania to verify non-smoking. The staff would not listen when I said I refused to stay in his horrible smelly and dirty room. The lobby was also dirty, and they cannot accommodate a group of people before a cruise. About 4 hours later, after they sent a man with a can of spray to remove the smoke???? really a can of spray???? YES!, and I refused to stay there, they found a room with 8 spotlights in the ceiling, no towel bars on the 2nd floor that was non-smoking. I wonder what this room is used for during other times, because no other hotel room has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???? Perhaps the police needs to know about this place that has 8 spotlights pointing to the bed???!!! We had to move our things ourselves after fighting with them for hours. And the consierge gave out bad advice about what time to leave for the ship. They said they have a smoking floor for over 20 years, and there is no way they can remove the smell of smoke from a room. I said I called long distance from Pennsylvania a week before the stay, and they said no problem. Don't waste your time or money by staying at the Warwickand they do nothing to help you. if you want a great place try the Doubletree Suites at Seattle, WA SEATAC near the airport for a large room with great accommodations and a great staff and they have people in the lobby to print your airline boarding passes with complete gracious, efficient staff for everything!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21119092">Got a room on the 3rd floor... checked in around 2100h, so options were limited.

We arrived very late (after midnight) and have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the customer service at that time. Our room was #1905 on the top floor. It was basically a bedroom off a suite, as it had two connecting doors. We did request to be moved but were told the hotel was sold out and there were no more available rooms, which I found hard to believe. We decided to stay with the room rather than move the next day. Our view of the Space Needle was great although the balcony they advertise is no more than a stand-only balcony. Still nice to get fresh air though if you want it. We had very little noise even though we were right across from the elevator. I think floor 19 is a suite-only floor so there weren't many guests. Also, being so high up we didn't hear any street noise. Our room was decently sized with a queen size bed, separate area sink with mini bar, large desk, two side tables and large entertainment armoire/dresser with an older TV. Internet service was expensive - we paid $25 for three days. Room service was also expensive, which is expected, but was very tasty. We ordered breakfast one morning and it was delivered quickly and was very good. I was a bit disappointed in the concierge - they couldn't recommend a dance club when asked and their method was to search the internet for it - something I'd already done myself but was just looking for a recommendation. The location was great - a few blocks from the Space Needle and EMP and close to Pike's Place Market and the waterfront. Lots of shopping places nearby also and a small Ralph's grocery across the street. I used the gym a few times - there is also an indoor pool. The gym is small but has newer cardio equipment and a nice selection of hand weights. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the hotel other than the location. The rooms were decent but nothing spectacular, the customer service not that great and their cost for the internet was high.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20623235">We chose the hotel due to the excellent location in Seattle. I booked by contacting the property directly and had a wonderful first impression of the service. I also called back to verify that I advised of a late check-in and was once gain spoke with a courteous property representative. The hotel recommended a terrific sedan service direct to the hotel (complete with mini tour of the city). Check-in was effortless and the room request was honored as booked. We requested an upper floor (needle facing) and frankly am glad we had the booking. At 0600hrs there were a couple of folks in a theatre entranceway across the street from the hotel whose voices were amplified in the entrance, we could hear them on the 15th floor. Gilcrest and Soames toilettries were a nice touch and other room features are frankly forgettable (for a property considered to be 'luxury".) The view was nice, breakfast was great, fast and friendly in the dining room and the complimentary business center was a G*dsend (since I forgot my Seattle maps). One may come across websurfers monopolizing the computers, so get there early. For those familiar with "Ralphs" grocery in California, sadly the one across from the property is not the same. We reserved our walkabout for the next day in daylight, as the area has some sketchy elements if one is not familiar with Seattle. We'd stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20473182">North end of downtown Seattle, great restaurants nearby, good prices. The rooms need to be updated, literally thought I was sleeping on a 1970's bed with old pillows and sheets. Net result is a bad nights sleep. I would stay their again for the location but that is it. Staff is very friendly also.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20383852">As a travel agent myself, I booked my group at this hotel for both the a pre-cruise stay and post-cruise stay. My room faced the Space Needle on both stays making for a great view. I have to say that this had to be the loudest, noisiest hotel room I have ever stayed in anywhere. My 1st night there, Sept. 12th, the city was doing road work on one of the cross streets until 1pm, then at 3pm drunk neighbors were yelling off their balcony to the street people partying in the parking lot below. Doesn't make for a good nights rest after flying for 4 hours and checking in at 10:30pm. If you are a light sleeper (or if you have any problems with night noise), request a back room that faces the back streets and not the space needle. The lobby is so very small so when you have a lot of rooms checking in/out at the same time then there is no room for people to even move at the counter with luggage. I find that this hotel is sold-out often so getting early check-in is hard. I found the rooms to be nothing but standard. I wouldn't consider them anything near 4-star, nor the hotel for that matter. I have stayed in numerous hotels around the world from 2-star to 5-star and this one I ranked as just a room to stopover at prior to the cruise. The room was clean, bathroom was clean but nothing to write home about. The one major thing that the Warwick has going for it is it's location! You can walk to Pike Place Market as well as many places to eat like MaMa's for Mexican. The bellman - Joe, at the Warwick was the best employee that we encountered there. He helped us with informing us with which bus numbers to take to go down to Pioneer Sqaure (there's a free city bus that stops right outside the Warwick that goes to Pioneer Sqaure). He also set up our car service back to the airport for us without even being asked to. Just left us a voice mail in our room saying what time they would pick us up in the morning. It's cheaper to take the car service than a taxi so the hotel can arrange that for you. I did eat 1 meal at the Warwick and that was breakfast, it was fine. $40 for 3 people and all I ordered was the blueberry pancakes. If time had permitted I would have walked to Pike Place Market and ate down there. Bottled water in the room is $4 so run across the street to the grocery store and buy it there, it will be cheaper for you. There is no safe in the rooms and they charge I think $11 per day for internet service. Parking is $26 per day at the hotel unless you get in on one of trhe Weekend Specials. If you have a group going to Seattle, we used Shuttle Express and set up a "private" city tour for 3 1/2 hours and they took us all the places we wanted to go. It was great and they picked us up right at the hotel. Got a really good rate and by having the private tour we didn't have outsiders with us so it made it a lot more fun.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20263232">I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel.

I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20234608">I had a great stay here! The location is perfect and within walking distance of many things. There is a grocery store across the street that is open late for snacks. If you want a great view and less of the city noise, I reccommend paying a few extra dollars to get one of the deluxe rooms- that way you are guaranteed to have a view of the Space Needle or the City. My room was on the 17th floor and I was lucky enough to have a view that included the Space Needle, and a little bit of Elliot Bay and Lake Union. There was new bedding/mattresses, and carpet in our room- the bathroom was the only disappointing part- the shower head was small and didn't have very much pressure. The staff was very friendly and willing to help- a complete turnaround from when I stayed here about 3 yrs ago. When I first arrived, I was given a coupon for the restaurant in the hotel (didn't eat there- not much variety and pricy) and a very helpful map of the city.

We did just as we saw here and asked for an odd numbered room on the sixth or higher floors. The view was fabulous. The skyline and a direct view of the Space Needle. Quite impressive. The room was boutique and smaller than most luxury hotels but it was clean and comfy. We spent five days there and everyone was nice and helpful. We used the free internet to help navigate around the town. A very nice hotel centrally located in the downtown area. Everything was easily accessible by bus or foot. It would have helped to have a few bus schedules to points of interest in the lobby but the people riding the buses as well as the drivers were quite friendly and informative. The tv worked fine and had a great selection of channels. There is in room coffee, quite convenient but this is Seattle, coffee is much better from the surrounding shops. Pricewise and value wise this was a great place to stay.

All our previous selections had been a great sucess, so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home. We were travelling with 2 small children (5&amp;7) so booked one room for us all. The lobby of the hotel is small and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel. We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage. The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle. The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling. We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us. He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay! He gave us directions &amp; even advised us on portion sizes. The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful &amp; unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude. We enquired about other breakfast restaurants, whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings. The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups &amp; glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out. We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents. Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant. The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to places, but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey. We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill. When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it. Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff. We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17807947">We, along with another couple, stayed at the Warwick for 4 nights from 18th May.

I had a great view of the city, especially at night! In response to earlier reviews saying the rooms were drafty and cold, I had absolutely no problem with that. If there is one thing I will say about the room, it's that the heating was excellent! Rooms are a little outdated and mine was pretty small, but they're comfortable and clean, so no complaints there. This hotel has an excellent location for many local sights, great restaurants and pubs within walking distance as well. The staff was great and helpful with whatever I needed. Did not use the pool or fitness center. I would have liked to have used the business center, but it was always full. My only complaint was that the food I got from room service had a hair in it. It took awhile for room service to take my order, but the delivery was fast. Nice stay at the Warwick, would stay again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16860738">I don't typically write reviews on sites, but I saw the last one and wanted to update it... I am physically writing from a room on the 16th floor of the Warwick hotel, visiting here from Hollywood, CA. I've stayed at a couple of hotels during this visit, and I have to say - this is extremely nice. I wanted to comment on the noise comment - I have to say, I think if you're familiar with city noise, this place is actually very quiet. I'm (again) from Los Angeles, so maybe my perspective is a little different, but it's actually a very quiet part of town. There is some construction going on about a block down, but it's during the day and not loud at ALL. I can't hear any of the other rooms, and the heater makes.. Well, the noise a normal hotel heater would make. It's within walking distance of the Space Needle ( and the museums around it), as well as Pike Place Market (and the waterfront). There is a very helpful store right across from it that stays open until 2 AM.. There's also constant cabs waiting outside the front lobby for when you want to visit other parts of the city. Also, if you have the opportunity - and no height issues - I would suggest asking for one of the higher floors - the rooms are all the same up until the suites on the top floor, so it's not pricier to ask for one. The view from either side is amazing - you can choose to have a view of the Space Needle, or of the city (I suggest the city - GORGEOUS). The staff have all been incredibly nice and helpful, and the room is exceptionally clean. Would totally suggest it to anyone!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16641800">The hotel is well located within the downtown core but the traffic and street noise is very loud. We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel. City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long. Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16444391">I am amazed at how special they made my mom feel. When I booked this hotel, I told them it was for my mom's 60th birthday, and asked simply that someone wish her a happy birthday. Much to my surprise and delight, they did so much more. When we arrived, I was told that our room had been upgraded to a room with a view of the Space Needle - it brought tears to my eyes. Last time we came to Seattle, we stayed at The Fairmont - and while it was nice, it wasn't too special in any way...just nice. This time...well, I'd lost my job earlier this year, so The Fairmont was out of my price range, and the reviews on The Warwick looked like we would have a nice stay; but that was all I was expecting as well. What we experienced was phenomenal - the front desk clerk Lisa Smith not only secured us an upgrade, but when we returned late at night from a day of shopping and a nice dinner, there was a champagne bucket with Martinelli's sparkling cider and two glasses waiting in my room; she also said "Happy Birthday" on a note, and we found an accompanying cheese/fruit place set beside it as well. Blew me away. I would not hesitate to recommend this place. It is a little older, but it is in a terrific location (amazing restaurants surround it, and two blocks from shopping, plus the new Indiana Jones movie was playing across the street), everything is really clean, with hints of modern furnishings to update it - and of course, most of all, their personal touch made my mom's 60th a memory for us both to cherish. Location location location, tidy, and personal touches; what's not to love...especially when they make your loved ones feel important!?!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15897343">I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights. The lobby and dining areas are fine. The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work. I had a room on the "quiet side" of the 12th floor. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel. As previous posts mentioned, there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way. I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked. The room was so loud from buses and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time. I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips and this was by far the noisiest. The towels and sheets were threadbare. The heater roared loudly, and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft. The conference facilities were drafty and the food was average. The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant and he sent me down the wrong street. This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR15358622">We had researched several different hotels before deciding on the Warwick- we chose it because of the affordable price and location in the city.

It has a nice restaurant and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. If you have the money to spend, this would be a great place to stay. The only thing I did not like about this hotel is they make you use their wireless internet service which you have to pay for. If you have dial up capability, it will work for a while, once they learn that you are using free dial up, they will but a block so you can't dial up. Majority of the staff is nice, but when I stayed there, the person who checked me in was absolutely rude.

Reading the other reviews, I definitely have to agree with alot of them, the hotel is starting to show its age. The location is great, and with Ralph's Grocery Store right across the road, its so convenient! The service there is decent but wasn't memorable. This time we were on the 7th floor and it was so noisy. We were woken up a few times during the nights by so many loud sirens and outside noise. I know this is downtown Seattle, but I never experience it this bad when staying at the Warwick on a higher floor and when staying at Mayflower Park a few blocks down. The room was average, could use renovation. The water pressure in the shower was terrible! Perhaps it was just the floor? I love the restaurant they have there, its such a great place to have breakfast! Excellent service! I would stay here again despite of the noise and the rooms showing their age... but I think next time I'll try another place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14556136">Stayed a night at the Warwick over March Easter weekend. Looked through the reviews here and prices of places on expedia previous to travelling from Vancouver and this place looked to be the best value, and it was. We got an even better rate with our Automobile Association membership (AAA or CAA). It was $132/night including all taxes - about a $20 saving over their already reasonable rate (IMO). Parking is an additional $27 but they didn't charge us for this. Basically we were looking for an upgrade to a motel and wanted an indoor pool and hot tub, and wanted to be in the heart of the city. This was it, with pros and cons. We could have stayed at a Quality Inn (1/1/2 stars) for $80/night, or The Sheraton (4 stars) for $210/night. Wasn't drawn to either for reasons of amenities and price respectively. Overall, the biggest pro is what you get more than you pay for IMO: Service well beyond a motel; nice indoor pool and hot tub (you'll find few of these in downtown Seattle), work-out room, newspaper at your door in the morning and invoice slipped under your door on the day you check out, friendly staff, easy early check-in upon our request, a very nice bar - we popped in for a martini - and restaurant which looked nicely run with French flair. Bathrooms are granite and quite clean, although a tad worn. Our room had a great view of the Space Needle. One outstanding feature is the proximity to everything, and this is what we wanted. We walked to everywhere over the 2 days we were downtown. EMP - which was outstanding - is within "Seattle Centre" as is the Science Centre and the Space Needle. The Science Centre is a must for those with kids; much bigger than Vancouver's Science World with more to do. We also walked to Pike Place Market, and to several restaurants and downtown stores close by. Also, about 3 blocks away from the Warwick is a great jazz bar called "Tula's" and the area of town (Belltown) has got great character while still being downtown and extremely convenient. Downtown stores were also an easy walk. We walked to Seattle centre, spent the day, then took the monorail (3 minutes ride) to downtown, then walked back to the hotel. A great day. Cons: Only two, but one worth noting for sure. Our room was on the 6th floor of about 25 floors(?) but much too noisy through the night. Not constant traffic, but intermittent busses made things tough. Our kids had no problem sleeping, but I awoke at 4:30 AM and checked our our window to see if it was open, which it wasn't. Next time, I will request a room much higher up which the check-out clerk said was the way to go. One other con was the beds were too small for me (with my wife). Maybe they were doubles(?); fine for the two small kids to sleep together, but we'd like at least a queen, which we are used to. Again, I'll request this next time. Tour tips: Forget the Space Needle. $50 for the family and while the view is awesome, you're up there for about 20-30 minutes unless you stay for a refreshment. Not worth it unless you're dying to see the lay of the land on a very nice day and have $50 burning a hole in your pocket. EMP- Same price as the Needle, but it was 4 hours of great stuff to do. Hands on music experience, as well as a science fiction hall of fame attached. Fabulous for kids or those who are into this. We thought our kids might get bored. They didn't and since we went after 3:30 (it closes at 5) they stamped our tickets to return the next day, which we did. Can't say enough about it. Science Centre: Again, great value and if you're from Vancouver and have a Science World membership, you get in free. But even if you pay the $30 or so for the family, there's lots to see with a great dinosaur exhibit, butterfly room and plenty more. Restaurants: Of course lots in the area, and we loved the Thai food places. Parking; Hotel parking is $27/day and is actually a pretty good deal for central downtown. That gets you parking for your stay and until 5 PM the day you check-out. Very convenient and we didn't bother hunting for a cheaper deal - what would we get elsewhere - $20/day - so why bother? Besides, they forgot to charge us for the parking upon check-in - we didn't notice until check-out and they just said "It's on us" when we checked out. Very nice. Overall, a very positive experience and we love Seattle. We're happy that we didn't pay the extra for the Sheraton, or go to the Quality Inn for not a lot less. We'd go back to the Warwick with a definite note to advise the staff upon reservation that we are "sensitive" to street noise, and to place us accordingly - upper floor - which I'm sure they will do.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14083410">I am glad I got a discount. The room was clean, but nothing special. In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear. The size and amenities were no different from a good Best Western. Just as noisy too. Maybe that is why there is a discount. The service was average. However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car. You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service. If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby. The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14055180">Stayed at the Warwick for a weeklong conference - the room was on a lower floor with a view of a parking lot (and my rate was at least $140-160) - the draftiest room I ever stayed in! A nightly wind across the floor... The neighborhood is perfect - close to everything. Room was clean and the appliances worked. I stuffed the bedspread against the window at night, to lessen the draft. Disappointed that my room rate could not include something nicer, or any view at all, but the city was booked for the conference. (FIX those windows!). Oh, and all I heard all the time was the elevator going up and down... so I didn't have a 'luxury' experience in my estimation. The biggest issue I had was that a housekeeper opened the room, and left the deadbolt in the state that it held the door open. I was staying in a single, came back from my conference, and my ROOM WAS OPEN. Spooked me - I called down after cautiously entering. The manager didn't see fit to come up - just called me back later, asking me if anything was missing. Lucky me, I had forgotten to close the safe, but everything including valuables was still in place. I think the manager could have managed to make an appearance in an instance like this, and I have had experiences in other hotels which were less dramatic, where a manager made an appearance to explain the problem. The restaurant is not good - even breakfasts were hit-or-miss (how do you screw up breakfast?) On the other hand, there are wonderful eateries in the neighborhood - try another venue. The staff in the restaurant were the nicest on staff, though! Oh, and the prices for breakfast in Seattle are shocking - not sure why. On the east coast you can eat like a king for $15 at breakfast - here, I didn't escape for under $22 and didn't necessarily feel full. I was offered a discount on my next stay, after I wrote the chain. But... I cannot imagine a repeat visit to that hotel. If I return to Seattle, I'll be looking for accommodations elsewhere. There are some fabulous hotels (my friends were in them, and some paid no more than I). Seattle's nice people and fun atmosphere were great - if that and a place to sleep are what you're looking for, this could be the place for you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13685244">We stayed 2 nights with a toddler. The room was fine and quite nice for a 3 star hotel. The location is nice and you can walk anywhere in the shopping area of downtown Seattle, including the market. Across the street was a grocery/deli store that was open late and you could grab food or a coffee. We would stay again. Th only negative were the staff. When we checked in (which was late at night after traveling with a toddler), they gave us a room that was not cleaned. Then we switched rooms and then they gave that room to someone else. When we checked out and caught a taxi early in the morning, no one helped us or even opened a door. There were tons of staff in the lobby (no other clients) and we had a toddler, stroller and LOTS of luggage. The doors are not automatic, so imagine us trying to get out and organized! Not one person even said hello. The lobby is small and they could not have missed us. That was very disappointing.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13442351">I stayed at the Warwick while on a business trip to Seattle. It's located in the downtown area and is very close to shopping, restaurants, Seattle Center etc. I took the Gray Line Airporter shuttle to the hotel from the airport. The Airporter runs every 30 minutes between 5am and 11pm for only $10.25 or $17 round trip. It was quick and the drivers were very friendly, I'd definately recommend this service. When I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was very welcoming. I received a room with a King bed on the 16th floor with a beautiful view. The room had a standard mini bar &amp; fridge, a small coffee machine and a comfy robe. I was relieved that they had room service and enjoyed a grilled sandwich and a glass of wine in my room after a long flight. This hotel is one of the few in Seattle to have a pool. The gym is nicely equipped and the business center is open 24 hours a day. Other amenities include turn down service and a daily newspaper. The restaurant served a delicous breakfast, and the bar was a nice quiet place for drink in the evening.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13293583">We selected the hotel based on the criteria that I was traveling with 2 12-year-old-girls who "wanted an indoor pool and to be close to Seattle Center and Pike Market." This narrowed the field, so we chose Warwick. Based on other reviews, I wasn't sure how the hotel would hold up to our expectations; happily, it did. I gave it a "5" because, for the price, there is absolutely nothing more I could have asked for or expected. We arrived in the city by car (crystal clear directions and super easy to get to hotel from I-5 - being a country girl, I'm a little nervous driving my stick shift on Seattle's crowded streets and hills) at 12:30pm. Called the desk from the garage to see if we could check in - No, not yet, but the room would be available at 1:30pm, but we could stay parked in the garage. - Great - At check in a while later the clerk was quick, polite and offered us a map of downtown, some attractions literature and a coupon to Macy's. Another employee walking by, recognized our name (he's the guy I spoke with earlier) and welcomed us and told us he had us in a nice room. Sure enough! when we got to the 14th floor, we had a killer view of the space needle dead in front of us, Lake Washington was off to the right and the Sound off to the left - wow, nice view from our little Juliette balcony! We were in a double/double and if was furnished nicely and clean. And gobs of pillows! - nice touch! After exploring the malls, market and the city, we headed to the pool. While it is true that it is small, I liked that about it - not "dungeon - y" at all, like another reviewer mentioned. The hot tub was hot and the pool water warm enough. The next morning the girls wanted to get in another swim and I wanted to get in some cardio. Nicely enough, the exercise room is adjacent to the pool and seperated by an all-glass wall. So I got in my 30 minutes of bike riding, all while being able to keep an eyeball on the girls in the pool - nice! An employee caught the elevator with us on the way out of the pool area in the morning and asked the girls how the pool was, they commented that it was nice and even warmer today than yesterday. The man replied something like - Great, I turned up the heat a bit from yesterday - and off he went into the lobby. It is refreshing to see people care about their jobs. Also, maybe because the hotel is unpretenious and makes you feel welcome, the other guests I spoke with at the pool and weight room were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their stay, as well. At check out, they allowed us to keep the car in the garage until 5pm...another REALLY nice touch! So the Warwick far exceeded my expectations, especially since I booked in at the AAA rate (104) !! Parking was $27 - which is expected for downtown and I got FULL use of it from 12:30 one day to 5pm the next. While the hotel isn't super upscale, it certainly delivers value for the price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR13093026">I read the reviews about noise, and used the hotel website to book my room. Interesting, their site gives you these checkbox options: 1) Room farthest from the elevator 2) Room on higher floor; 3) Quiet Room. In the interest of getting the QUIETEST room possible, I checked all three hoping to get one of the three. Well, I got on the 6th floor (out of 18-19 floors), across the hall from the elevator, and listened to trucks and ambulance sirens all night!! Sheeeesh!!!!! Aside from that, the heating units sound like small plane engines, and you can hear them from the surrounding rooms.

Every year we stay in downtown Seattle and go Christmas shopping. We had never stayed at the Warwick before. I found out about it on Seattlesupersaver.com. Parking is quite expensive, (it is everywhere in Seattle) but it was included in the supersaver deal. The hotel room was good-sized, we had a small balcony and a great view of the Space Needle. It was worth it to pay $50 extra and get a little larger room and view. (I think the total was $149). It was so close to the downtown shopping area that we walked. It was only a few blocks. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay at a nice hotel in downtown Seattle but not break the bank.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11183987">Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown. I would classify this property as a three star location. We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition. The room was spacious although a little outdated. Perhaps some rooms have decent views but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings. There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel. Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars). I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11127524">We loved every one of our 4 nights at the Warwick, and laughed all the way to bank at the $104/night rate. While the Warwick looks like your typical Holiday Inn on the outside, it has been completely updated inside with warm, modern decor. We asked for and received a high-floor room with a nice view. Our request for an extra robe was filled within 5 minutes. The staff were attentive and helpful and the room was very clean, warm, and comfortable. We walked to ALL the sights downtown and never needed a car. The Hotel sent Shimsu with his towncar to pick us up at the airport for $35, just $3 more than a cab. Totally worth it. Our only bad experience was trying to catch the regular airport shuttle back to Seatac from the hotel. The Warwick sold us our shuttle tickets the night before our departure, then informed us the next morning that the shuttle wasn't coming because of street closures for the Seattle marathon, then initialy refused to refund our ticket, until we complained loudly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11076894">My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November.

When i was settling into room, front staff said they located a two queen room and so i was moved. Package was to include free parking but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about. I'lll see what they do about it. Would i stay again? Hard to say.

First off, the staff was very friendly at check in and it is apparent that someone is working with them on customer service. They seem to be trying a little too hard -- in other words, they haven't perfected their customer service persona yet. When we got up to our room, I was pleased with a great view of the space needle but disappointed by the VERY LOUD street noise. (And we were on the 6th floor -- can't imagine how loud it was on the 2nd or 3rd floors) The room itself was generally comfortable but the bathroom was cramped and could have been cleaner. There were some mildew spots in the shower that just needed some bleach applied. It was a potentially really fancy marble shower that could have been really impressive it were cleaner and had a better fixture set up. Parking is a complete night mare in this area and we ended up paying $27 to park at the hotel overnight, which is a real rip-off but you really don't have much of a choice. Also, the parking garage doesn't have an elevator so you should plan on sending the most fit person in your group to park and lug the bags down/up the stairs. I don't feel this room is much of a bargain considering I paid almost $150 for one night on H*tw*re. I probably wouldn't do it again. No major complaints but I wasn't blown away either.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10374856">I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed, so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended. The bed sheets were old and felt like they were poorly washed. The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water. Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet. The drain was slow and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower. One side of the room is all window with a patio window...not much of a view. So with the window also came all the city noise. Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either "Off" or "Automatic" so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise. It was slightly cool outside and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window. The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines. The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area. The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport. Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10080872">I found my whole experience at the Warwick fantastic!

Returning to the Warwick after a day out with the realtor was just what my husband and I needed. The staff were always welcoming upon our return, and very helpful in answering all of our questions. Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable, with an absolutely spectacular view of the Space Needle. The location is perfect for walking almost anywhere, and we enjoyed many delicious meals in the Brasserie Margaux Restaurant. We especially liked their crabcakes and the tapas selection at "Happy Hour". The Hotel was decorated for the Fall season, which added to to the warm, welcoming atmosphere.

Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor. Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.). They charged us more than the quoted price, but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now. To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights! $487.51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL. We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem; we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will "be fixed immediately--I promise." This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10065014">I was in Seattle for my best friends wedding and she had reserved a block of rooms at this hotel. My husband and I checked in Friday night, along with another couple, intending to stay two nights. When we checked in, we were told that our room would be a different price than what we were quoted. I questioned the woman checking us in and she said we needed to have the confirmation number. I printed off the confirmation number and showed it to her. She then told me that the confirmation number was not enough, and that I needed to have the price I was quoted in writing. I did not have time to deal with that right away ( I had to get ready for the rehearsal and grooms dinner.) So, we ran up to our room to get ready. When I opened my hotel room door, the smell of smoke was overpowering. I immediately returned to the front desk because I had definately not booked a smoking room. The woman at the desk told me that my room was not a smoking room, but the floor underneath my room was smoking and it must have drifted up. !?! I asked her what she could do for me, and quickly because I needed to get ready and go. After she debated with a couple other employees I was told I could wait 40 minutes while they cleaned it or check into a room on the 6th floor (no view) which was a downgrade from my 15th floor with a view. I had no other choice than to take the downgrade. I asked to speak with a manager, no one was available. I asked to speak with the person that I had originally booked my room with. I was told I could call the front desk and asked to be connected to her, if she was in. We stayed the night, in the 6th floor room, and the fan in the bathroom was broken! The next day, I reported the broken fan, and again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager on duty was on lunch break,but I could leave my cell phone number and they would call me. I never recieved a call. We all checked out after the one night, telling the person at the desk that we were extremely dissatisfied. The staff seemed very uncaring. I asked for directions to the Marriot by the water, they could not give me directions. I asked them to look it up on mapquest for me, they couldn't do that either. I just looked at my bank statement and realized they have charged me for 2 nights! I will have to call and figure this out now. This hotel is a joke, and it is not even nicely decorated. It seems run down and old. The bride had the suite on the top floor, and even that room wasn't amazing. The furniture was marble, but chipped and looked out dated.

Even before we had arrived at the hotel we received great customer service! Well, we were lost (google directions weren't very good) and it was dark, so we called the hotel and the lady who answered the phone stayed with us on the phone directing us to the hotel until we dropped our car off with the valet. The parking may be pricey, but the free shuttle service the hotel has, more than made up for the cost! Also, because we were in downtown we walked to Macy's, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and to the mall. The restaurant in the hotel was very good! But a tip - make reservations for Sunday brunch because it gets quite busy. The service was great, the rooms were very comfortable and clean. The water pressure was lacking but that was the only con during the whole trip.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful and were able to answer all our questions about buses, ferries, sights etc. We would have liked the Hotel to have a stock of bus and ferry timetables but this is a minor point. The Hotel is extremely well situated for getting around Seattle. It is walking distance from Pike Place Market, The Space Needle and The Museums of Music and Science Fiction. There are bus routes conveniently nearby which will take you to most destinations including the Airport for a mere $1.25! It is also walking distance from some good restaurants. An added bonus is the fantastic Deli/Supermarket opposite the Hotel. They do great breakfasts as well as snacks, wine etc - check it out!

When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights. We ended up arriving at the Warwick at 10pm, we checked into our 4th floor room and were very surprised when we opened the patio curtains only to find that we were looking directly at a cement wall about 2 feet away from the porch. No view at all. We called the front desk, and they said sorry, but since we arrived late they were unable to accommodate us but maybe the next night they would be able to move us to a higher room with a view. Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle. Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds. Can't complain about the rooms. The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer. The staff, however, left more to be desired. We do not have kids of our own, but I noticed how rude the staff was to some small children that were in the lobby our second day there. It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members. One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in, then looked at the parents as if it was their fault. Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all. It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests. Our second night there, my husband and I were standing in the lobby, waiting for some friends, and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter. Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others. It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8243352">I stayed one night here on business, booked by my company.

We didn't want to have to pay a lot for the hotel and parking. We ended up decided on the Warwick because the AAA rate was $113. Parking was an addition $20, so all in all we ended up spending just under $150 for the night. I was nervous about staying here because I'd read some of the reviews on tripadvisor. Admittedly, when we first arrived, we were a bit put off by a rude desk clerk! However, the individual that checked us in was very nice (he gave us tips on where to eat, best way to get to the monorail, and just a general overview of downtown Seattle). I am probably writing this review because I left an item in our hotel room. I was really worried because I didn't know if I'd be able to get it back. (If you must know it's my childhood pillow). At any rate, the hotel contacted my husband to let him know that they had my pillow and wanted to know where to send it.!!! They sent my pillow and I can now rest easy! The beds were comfortable, and we had a pretty decent view of the city. So, I'd say the room was about a 4 out of 5. It's in a really good location, about 3 blocks to Pikes Peak, 4 blocks to the actual waterfront, and 6 blocks from the Space Needle.

Thereafter things got better - we had a very spacious room on the 17th floor with a great view of the Space Needle, service in the restaurant was OK although the air conditioning in the bar could do with being turned down - it was like sitting in a fridge.

Upon check in the staff was not really welcoming. Bed linens are low quality, torn blankets, thin and worn flat sheet thrown over a thin, felt like pad on bottom mattress. We were there Thursday through Sunday, by the time we left Sunday, our trash container was stacked about 2 feet tall with trash that had not been removed from the room since the first day (newspapers, pizza boxes, plastic bags, paper cups). I kept pulling it further into the room each day, thinking they couldn't possibly miss it again. They did. Even though the hotel went through a renovation not too long ago, the rooms are pretty dated. Parking was expensive, $21 per day, plus wifi at $9 per day. with sales tax over 15% added on, it was not an inexpensive hotel. I remember seeing it rated as 4 star. I'd probably say more like 2.5 star. Parking for guests is on levels 4 and above. Yet, there is no elevator in the garage. Location of the hotel is very good, and although we did not try them, the bar/restaurant seemed pretty busy. Bottom line....we were not impressed with either the service or the hotel itself, and will definitely stay elsewhere next time we are in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7477677">I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel. It has some good points - for example, it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location. (It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk). However, those are the only positives. The rooms are very dark and the furniture is really old and mismatched. This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in. As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed. The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean. Everything else was a crap shoot. My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing. They have these "balconies", which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold. I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help. And when it actually kicked on , the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting. It smelled like mold and mildew. We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell. Anyway...I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep. Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort. The Warwick charges $23, (I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day. By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more. If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7275823">Stayed here for two nights as part of a tour package.

We walked home from a movie at 12:45am and felt very safe in the area. This is will definitely be our first choice when staying in Downtown Seattle. If this hotel could be mimicked in every other major city in the world for value and comfort every other hotel chain would be out of business.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6724660">The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants. It has a nice lobby and the rooms were pretty clean. The front desk, however, was a horror show. We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning, we did not get our coffee, and consequently arose an hour late. And in Seattle of all places! On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation. Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour and that we should take a taxi. The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was "too far away". The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it. The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again. But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6711819">I stayed at the Warwick hotel 26-28 Jan. I chose it because it was close to Seattle Center where I was attending the Travel Convention. The hotel is ok. Nothing spectalular. The front desk people are friendly though twice when my sister and I asked for directions, the ladies we asked had to go find the manager to ask her. The room we stayed in on the 17th floor was clean. It had a gorgous view of downtown Seattle. The only problem with the room was the lighting was very poor in the bathroom and the handle on the toliet fell off when I flushed so you had to be very careful. But the room was quiet and comfortable. The only other problem we encounter was in our search for a working ice machine. This hotel has 19 floors but only 4 ice machines..17th, 15th, 8th and 4th floor. The one on the 17th floor was out of order, the one on the 15th floor was out of order but Eureka! the one on the 8th floor was working so all wasn't lost. In summary, for the price I paid, it was an adequate hotel with a good location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6692232">We booked a room here over thanksgiving weekend with 2 small kids. The location was great! You could walk to everything. We walked to a great coffee house called Cherry Street every morning for coffee and breakfast then went to the museums and space needle then took a cab back to the hotel since it was very cold. One night my husband had a meeting to go to so me and the 2 kids walked around to the merry go round and macy and to pf changs for dinner where by the way we had a wonderful and I mean wonderful time eating greasy Chinese food. We even walked into macy's and got a santa picture of my two kids. No one was there and no line to wait it. What luck and timing. The kids rode on the merry go round and we walked back to the warwick and felt safe and sound. We did eat at the restaurant in the lobby one night and it wasn't good at all. Try one of the restaurants next door/down the street. They all looked so good. Next time we will. Warwick is great for the location, clean, good rates, nice pool, gym and valet parking (parking is a lot but a lot everywhere in seattle hotels).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6520567">Can't beat the Warwick for cost in Seattle. We were forced to stay here after our power was out for over a week at home. Being a native I know Seattle. The location was great, 3 blocks up from Pike Place, just a 4 or 5 blocks over from the Space Needle. We got the winter special, and got a corner room with a direct view of the needle, and Lake Union to the right, on the 15th floor for $100/night. The hotel was renovated, but there is still plenty left from the original 1984 building. The windows are old, and a bit drafty, the street noise, as in all big cities, is constant. We turned up the heat and did just fine. They offer all the things an expensive hotel does, witha great view, for a great price. We would definately stay there again, I'm not going to pay 200/night + to stay anywhere else in Seattle, when the Warwick is available. The restaurant next door, Assiago, was not worth the money, despite reading a good review we were disappointed. There are many better places to eat nearby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6352917">This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006 and the rooms are lovely. Although the rooms are modern, the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel. The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional. The location is convenient and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM. As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered. The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor, trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day. Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise. Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE. It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent. I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal. Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either. Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6161969">The Warwick is a perfect location for those who like very comfortable surroundings, a friendly and helpful staff, and close proximity (walking distance) to Pike Market, shopping of all kinds and performances at the Paramount, Moore or Jazz Alley.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6149407">On a whole our stay at the Warwick was pretty nice. I think the best part of the hotel is the location (walking distance to most attractions downtown) and the fact that they are a little cheaper than most other hotels in the area. If you go, don't expect a large fancy hotel. Request a high floor (7th or higher) for a view. The food and room service aren't really that great but there are some eating options that are very close.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6128053">The Warwick Hotel has a great location in Seattle. Close to shopping, PIke Place and the Seattle Centre. However what really lets this hotel down is it cleanliness. The bed linen was torn, bottom of curtains were torn and the floor had a few stains. The hotel advertises itself as having a balcony ,which in reality is a disappointment. We stayed in a hotel in San Diego which did have a balcony - table, chairs etc. The Warwick balcony is about 10 inches.The view from rooms with a view of the Space Needle is terrific, but doesn't make up for the poor cleanliness. The check in staff were neither pleasant nor unpleasant and we decided not to sample the restaurant. Ralph's deli across the street is great for snacks and also has a cafe.There are plenty other better hotels in Seattle for the same or slightly more money than the Warwick - choose one of them e.g The Hotel Andra.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6014699">My first trip to Seattle. I selected the Warwick based on reviews here (and it was a package available from United), and I was not disappointed. I found the staff to be quite friendly and knowledgeable. My room on the sixth floor was clean and comfortable (in fact, the first night there, I fell asleep early, with my clothes on, and stayed that way all night)! I ate in the restaurant, and the waitress nudged me away from my first choice, and gave me a thumbs up on my second choice (I asked for her advice), a delicious rigatoni dish with artichokes and olives. Their bread is especially wonderful! The location is convenient for walking; the hotel provided a very helpful map. I used the Grayline shuttle from the airport and back, which was so easy. I'd certainly stay at the Warwick again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6006603">My sister and I stayed in a two double bed room on the third floor (305) We requested a room on a higher floor, but none were available upon check-in. I've read reviews you can hear street noise on the lower floors. The room was very noisy and I couldn't get any sleep. If you're a light sleeper, go with a higher floor if you can get one. Room was nice (at time of walk in), but small. Bathroom was small as well and didn't have enough towels for two people. When we closed the curtains, I noticed several stains. They were dark reddish brown in color. I'm assuming they were blood stains. I was disgusted. The phone's earpiece was visibly dirty and there was a hair in the bathtub, before we used it. I left my comments about the room with management and haven't heard back. Location was great, close to shopping and the market. Parking was $21 a night, but a good deal since other lots are pricier and street parking is scarce. Check out is at noon and parking was good until 5pm. There is a grocery store across the street and a starbucks and seattle's best coffee 2 -3 blocks up on Lenora. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Food was good and service was great! Seattle Times paper was delivered every morning. Internet service is not included in the price of the room and cost $10 a day. If you're looking for restaurants in the area try The Icon Grill on 5th and Virginia and the Pink Door at Post Alley, 1st and Stewart.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5975779">The Warwick was plenty comfortable and nice for us. We had a nice view of the Space Needle from our room. Don't expect a balcony. There is just an 18 inch ledge with ironwork to keep you from falling overboard. But you can open the patio door and partially step out for a view of Lake Union and Elliott Bay. The last morning we were there, the top of the Space Needle was hidden by clouds. It was neat to see it in sunny weather and cloudy. We had everything we needed at the Warwick. No complaints.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5960956">Stayed at the Warwick on October 7 and 8, after booking through Expedia. It's a good hotel for the price, with nice rooms, restaurant, and pool/hot tub. The location is perfect, as you can park your car (Seattle is a CRAZY city to drive in) and walk everywhere. Only one problem with the stay. We were on the 8th floor, with a great view of the Space Needle. Late on Saturday night, the entire floor suddenly erupted in one huge party. The noise was incredible, as a large group of young people (not sure if they were high school or college age) were running up and down the hall, in and out of rooms with doors slamming, knocking on doors - including ours - and yelling and throwing things from the balcony to the street below. After several calls to the front desk, we asked to move to a different floor which, in spite of the hassle of having to pack our bags and relocate in the middle of the night, resolved the issue a(t least for us). We got a note of apology in our new room, along with a voucher for breakfast. I travel quite a bit, and have never run into this before. I'm not sure what a hotel can do in this situation - maybe some hotel owners or managers could explain what the policy is? One of the problems was apparently that there were several floors where the same thing was happening, and the hotel security was overwhelmed. The front desk clerk told me that as long as the guests were in their rooms, they were 'following hotel noise policy', which doesn't seem reasonable to me, if correct. In this case, it was more than simple rowdiness or high energy. I heard a voice from the next balcony saying 'Hey, don't -- on those people on the street!'! As well, when we finally did get a new room, the route to the elevator was blocked with a mass of people - on the floor, couples making out against the walls, people running up and down the hallways etc. Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts on this? Or, if you're a parent of someone who was on a school trip to Seattle over the Columbus Day weekend, and your child was staying at the Warwick, you might want to ask some pointed questions! Anyway, the hotel itself was fine, great location, reasonable price. Parking anywhere in Seattle is expensive, but at the Warwick there was secure parking available, and the location was easy to get to and leave from.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5905517">Stayed here for three nights in September 2006. The room was very comfortable, nice bed and clean bathroom. Found chocolates in my room upon arrival-nice touch. Other reviewers have mentioned that the rooms can be a bit noisy because of street noise. That's because you have a wall of windows - gives a great view but not totally soundproof. Ask for a room on an upper floor facing the Space Needle, there are 16 floors. I stayed on the 10th floor and had no problem with outdoor noise. Hotel is on 4th Avenue with lots of great restaurants nearby and a 10 minute walk to Pike Place market and shopping. Great bakery just a block away and a movie theater across the street. Shuttle bus from airport stops at the corner. The hotel is nice but not as nice as some other hotels in the downtown (but probably not as expensive either). Still, I would come back for another stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5818243">Stayed here for 2 nights last week.

Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available, although not the type I reserved. My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers. My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle. You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night.

We stayed pre-cruise at a different establishment. Checkin is at 3pm. we arrived earlier and they were happy to store our luggage and told us we should have rooms ready by 11:30 or 12:00. They were. We however were given wheelchair accessable rooms so I can't comment on the regular accomodations. The rooms are average size and comfortable, although the bed frame sticks out a bit on the ends leading to stubbed toes if you get too close. The bed was comforatble, and the room contained all the ammenities you would expect. TV, alarm clock, coffee maker, mini-bar. There are small balconies with sliding doors. The decor is typical of a high rise hotel, but the leather headboard makes a statement. Ice machines are available on four floors only. The pool and gym are located in the basement. THe pool is small and 3 feet deep, but very nice. The hot tub was broken so I cannot comment on it. The gym is well stocked with equipment and towels. There is also a two person sauna available. The mens room has lockers and showers for changing. Although I went to turn on the shower and the fixture fell off. I was blasted back into the wall by a stream of hot water. The bathroom was set up with a handicap shower, no tub, and a hand spray fixture which had very little water pressure. The hotel is VERY convenient to shopping and walking around. There is a shuttle to the airport for 10.25 per person that leaves every :25 and :55 on the hour. It takes about 25 minutes to get to the airport and is very comfortable. I did notice the staff recommending the private car service to the airport for $35.00 but this is about the same if not more than taking a cab, especially after tipping the driver. I leave that to personal opinion. Would I stay here again.....Most likely not. Although the staff was friendly, and the restaurant good, the hotel lacked the comfort and personality factor that I look for when I travel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5778783">We stayed here on the last few days of our Pacific Northwest honeymoon. The rooms were large, but the bathrooms small. Very convenient to walk to most sights in Seattle, but watch out for those hills. The complimentary shuttle is for a 2 mile radius and is free drop off, no pick up, but they did take us to the Pyramid Brewery one night which is right next to Safeco Field. I'm not sure if that's more than 2 miles away, but for us it definitely wasn't walking distance. That was very convenient. The restaurant I'm sure is overpriced, however, they had happy hour specials that we took advantage of each of the two nights we stayed there. I think it was $3 draft beers (large glasses and lots of variety and loca lmicrobrews), and buy two tapas selections and get the 3rd for free. They also had $1 off all well drinks. The tapas were reasonably priced and pretty filling, i was very surprised. They were also pretty creative, very tasty. The bed was far from luxurious. Actually, i didn't sleep under the covers just because of how the bedding looked. The blanket under the bed spread was ripped and looked as thought it had been there since the hotel was built and the sheets were all wrinkled. Not the best end to a honeymoon and not very romantic. They also did not vacuum the room when housekeeping came (we had to wait outside at 4:30pm for housekeeping to finish, so good thing the bar had those happy hour specials). We're not slobs, but we did leave some crumbs on the dark flooring from some chips that were still there and stepped on when we got back to our room. The only thing I would really want is a microwave in the room, we only had a small refrigerator. Overall, not a bad place, I would stay there again if I got another deal on hotwire, but definitely not a romantic stay for a honeymoon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5620596">We stayed here for three nights before a cruise.

Ralph's Grocery &amp; Deli across the street is very convenient (and they sell Lambic). We went to a Marines game on Sunday. It wasn't too bad driving to the stadium and parking (15 bucks to park).

Our room was not plush--but newish, clean with nice toiletries and bath robes. The service was fine and everyone who worked there was nice. In sum, the hotel is a bit of a compromise. Not the largest, not the most central, not the fanciest--but a convenient, well maintained place for the money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4986577">We like the Warwick because of the great location - an easy walk to Pike Place Market, the Science Center, and downtown.

Pool is small but OK. 3 out of 4 aerobic machines in fitness centre broken! A Space Needle view will have you facing Lenora St. This is a very busy bus route so be prepared for lots of street noise.

I walked from here to Pike's Place market for breakfast, then on to the convention center each day of the convention and found it all very convenient. (Try the Crumpet Shop for breakfast, delicious crumpets, and cheap lattes before 8:30am every day!) The hotel room was clean and everyone who worked here was helpful and perfectly friendly. The bed was too comfortable :). The first night I had trouble sleeping though, because the heater would wake me up every couple of hours. By the second night, I learned to tune it out. There is a coffee maker in the room, by the way (I had read somewhere that there was only coffee in the lobby, and this is not true.) There is also a nice little fridge where I stored away spring water for my week. I had a view of the Space Needle without even asking - very nice. Unfortunately, they were working on the pool during my one-week stay, and that was kind of annoying because I had chosen the hotel for their pool. I did get to swim the first night, and it was a nice smallish pool. There was a lukewarm hot tub attached. All in all, though, nice amenities.

The front desk staff were fantastic - we arrived in the morning after missing our first night due to the Amtrak train running late and we were fully expecting to be charged for the night we missed - but they waived that nights charges, something they didnt have to do. The rooms were nice and clean, we had a fantastic view of the Space Needle. We were using this hotel as a temporary stop over before going to the Inn at El Gaucho (see review) and when we were leaving the Warwick provided a shuttle to El Gaucho - fantastic service.

They had stayed at the Warwick many years ago and loves the space needle view. So, we booked both of our rooms at the Warwick for a three night stay. Upon arrival, my cousin told me, don't expect a huge lobby or check in counter. Boy was she right!! The lobby area is very small but cozy. Check in/out, question desk and concierge are all at one desk that is about 15 feet long. You feel so cramped if you are getting information and there are two people waiting behind you!! But, very good service. The manager who checked us in gave us coupon books, maps, anything that was going to help us around the city. That was very nice! The room was clean and looked nice. Until we went into the restroom. It was clean, very small, but clean but looked like a fist was coming through the ceiling. It was very weird! Also, in the shower, there was a cover that looked as if it was ready to fall off. We paid for the upgaded view of the space needle. We were told we'd be able to see it from our bed. Well, that was false. In order to see the needle, you had to stand in the corner and look at it or open the slider to see it. It was ok though. We read some reviews about the pool being kind of dingy and dark, but nice once you were in the water. So we tried it out. It is in the basement, but the elevator takes you right there. The first thing you notice when you walk in is the stench of chlorine. It smelled so bad. We decided to muddle through and went in the pool. The temp was nice, but we then opted for the spa. From the steam and the chlorine, both my husband and I had to leave because our eyes were burning and watering so bad. We told the front desk and a lady responded with "how do you expect us to keep it clean?" Overall, it was nice, but we probably won't stay there again. We found a hotel a few blocks closer to all of the shopping that was way nicer and cleaner and had cheaper rates. I think we will give it a try next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4138105">I travel for business and prefer relatively small hotels instead of the huge, name-brand dormatories.

Tiny excertise room, pool, adequate restaurant, 24 hour room service. All at rates lower than the more famous people barns down the street. A very pleasant experience. PS.

Worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4126006">We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick. I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient. The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few problems worth mentioning. We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony. My husband smokes, but I do not, and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room. If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human. We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony, especially with the balcony door closed. Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor. This floor is where the public meeting rooms and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located. We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view. We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor. No Space Needle, no view. This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms. The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era "cans" (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed. It felt like starring in your very own "intimate film". The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed. The traffic noise was incredibly loud, and hotel construction noise started very early. Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day. We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated. The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up, and we had a nice Space Needle view. The bed was comfortable, the amenities average. We liked the in-room refrigerator. There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel. Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend, but I would take care if staying during the week. Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet). I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay. We did not use the pool or jacuzzi. As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort. However, we liked the bar quite a bit. Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere. We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience. There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle, but the food was OK and we had a nice time. The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations. The lobby fireplace added a cheerful, cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing. I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle. However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise, the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4104009">A great place to stay in downtown Seattle.

The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation. At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card and stated there were no king beds and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds. We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice! It was nonsmoking. There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel. The "Warwick" mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells. The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine. The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning. The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning and pressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation; however, the tub facet dripped continuously. The tub drain needs attention, the shower curtain has holes in it. There was no coffee maker in the room.

I had made our reservations well in advance in order to secure a special group rate for our company's partygoers. The reservations agent that I spoke with was pleasant, thorough, and helpful - he made sure that I understood what I would need to know about my reservation. Our first discrepancy occurred upon arrival. I had researched, at the Warwick's own website, the cost of overnight parking - it stated that it was $21.00 effective March 1, 2005. When we arrived, however, the parking attendant informed us that it was $18.00 and that we could add it to our bill. Upon check-in, this information changed again and we were instead informed that parking was indeed $21.00. Honestly, I believe that both amounts are ridiculously overpriced, especially considering that other hotel guests paid much more for their reservations and still had to pay this outrageous parking fee. Regardless, I disregarded the discrepancy and signed my bill. I wasn't going to cause a stink over $3.00. The bill was the second discrepancy of the afternoon - our company was given a group rate of $79.00 per night, however, my check-in information stated that it was $75.00. I shrugged this off as well, figuring that it made up for the miscommunication with regards to the cost of parking. The room itself was lovely. We were pleased with its setup and cleanliness and I really admired the furniture. While a fan in the bathroom would have been nice, it was easily overlooked once we opened the curtains and looked out onto the city - what a great view! Upon check-out the next morning, we again met with inconsistencies. Our bill was slid under the door of our room prior to our departure, so I reviewed it for accuracy. Suddenly the room rate was $79.00 again! While this was the rate that I had expected to pay, I was a little annoyed with the constant miscommunication. Not only that, but there were others from my company staying at the Warwick also - they had also mentioned checking in at a rate of $75.00. When my husband and I arrived at the front desk to check out (for some reason, video checkout would not work for our room), I mentioned these discrepancies to the front desk clerk. I made it clear, or so I thought, that I wasn't worried about the small amount of money that these miscommunications involved ($7.00, all told), but that I wanted someone to know what had happened. I wasn't even able to get out that I knew others that had been advised $75.00 at check-in that may be, well, more vocal than I was being. The desk clerk seemed clearly put out by this information and gave me short, quick answers to my questions. He informed me that the garage attendents were still having trouble remembering that their rate had changed and that the company party rate was $79.00. I explained to him again that I was okay with paying $79.00, but wanted him to realize that the paperwork provided at check-in stated $75.00. Honestly, he huffed and puffed and then took $4.00 off my bill. Really? I didn't care about the money. I just wanted him, or anyone, to know that people were being misinformed. My husband, who is quick to tell me when I'm getting overbearing and pushy (aren't all husbands good for that?), agreed that I had not done anything of the sort when speaking with the desk clerk. Overall, I can't give this hotel more than 3 stars. The hotel itself is beautiful and centrally located, but the service and attention we received was far from expectation.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3229772">We stayed at the Warwick for three nights about two years ago and loved it. We had traveled by Amtrak from Sacramento and then took the Clipper to Victoria for a couple of days. It was a magical vacation...all public transportation and walking to our destinations. Our room had one whole wall of windows that faced the Space Needle. (There was a sliding door that opened onto the balcony...weird) The room was small, but so cozy. The staff was wonderful. They have 24 hour shuttle service and we enjoyed talking with the drivers. We had dinner one night and it was great, the waitress had a strong French accent (something we don't hear often in CA) Beautiful food presentation, We easily walked to the Market. The Mall was great, with Monorail stop so convenient. Street entertainers were wonderful,and we were delighted to find real stores open on Sunday. We bought bento (box) lunches at the sandwich shop near the hotel and took them on the train, It was the best vacation ever..so glad that my daughter told us to stay at the Warwick. later I remembered that I had stayed at a Warwick hotel in Denver and enjoyed that too.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3100658">Stayed the weekend of January 28th at the Warwick Hotel.Booked the day before and was told all I could get was a smoking King size on the city side.I told them that my preference would be a king size non-smoking on the Space Needle side away from the elevators as I had read here.When we arrived we discovered that our room was as requested.We were greeted by the concierge who was very helpful.The room was average size and the bed was comfortable.The wife loved the tub and the marble tiles in the bathroom.The room was very clean.We had a package that they advertised on their website which was $150 per night tax included , parking, and breakfast in the restaurant (which was very good).All hotels in Seattle charge anywhere from 15-25 dollars a night for parking.The location is great we walked to the Pike Place Market ,the Harbour front,the convention centre area at night for dinner.There were lots of people walking about and we had no safety concerns.Ralph's grocery market /Deli is next door and open till 2AM for food or snacks.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2818540">Well for those who read trip advisor reviews, I hope you will pay close attention to this one. We stayed recently at the Warwick Seattle, for a few nights before continuing our Pacific Northwest journey to British Columbia. We booked through Clipper Vacations, the price was right, and we were told we would really like this hotel. From the moment we walked in there was a definite charm to it; cozy older lobby with a fireplace, 4 clocks from different major cities (I like this feature) and a concierge desk. At the front desk we were greated by a very cold and young front desk agent . No formal greeting no nothing, but a straight and matronly face (we were surprised as she must have been under 20). We asked her not to put us near the elevator in a room number ending in a 6. (We read this on trip advisor). She put us in roon number ending in 8. We went up to the room and this room was right next to the elevator. I immediately marched back down, and asked her to switch the room. (she did without any apology) She moved us 4 doors down. We were in the room for an hour or 2. We noticed it was very cold in the room, and we tried to adjust the heat, it did not work. We called and immediately they came up to try to fix. It was redeemed broken. So we then moved to another 4 flights up. We were in this room 10 minutes, and they called to say they wanted to move us again as there was going to be alot of kids coming in for a wedding and they would be on this floor, so then we moved to another floor ( 4 different rooms). We asked if they could upgrade us to a larger room , they said no because we were on a package rate. I thought this was wrong as were inconvenienced. I was too tired to argue at this point. THE ROOM: the really need to redo standard rooms. The carpet is a checked brown and white, reminded me of an old holiday inn. The lights are very very dim, I guess to save money. The hotel is not in the greatest area and beware of seedy people around there. Brasserie Margaux was terrific and the grocery street across the street (ralph's) is great. I do not think I would stay at the Warwick again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2771689">We stayed here 27th Sep-30th Sep and had a fantastic stay. The hotel is within walking distance to the Space Needle or the waterfront and is ideally located. We had a room on the 12th floor with a fantastic view of the Space Needle.

A wonderful start to our holiday in the States !!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122476164">This place is not even suitable for the homeless take my advice and stay far far away! We booked only because every where else in town was full and looked at the last review and thought ok great location and comfortable beds, made all the previous ones seem possibly an exageration. NOT AT ALL people believe me you will hate this place! Upon arrival we were greated by a woman that could not speak english hardly at all, unable to answer our questions about the age of the hotel, parking, etc. Upon check in we got our room keys and were placed on the 9th floor on the way up the elevator which sounded horrible BTW the elevator stopped on the 2nd floor to pick up another rider going up, I about vomited right there the carpet was so terribly stained and the smell emitting from that floor was horrible, We made it to the 9th and although stained carpet not even half as bad as the 2nd floor we were a bit more hopeful. We booked a standard double room, and that's what you get, a tiny double sized bed, old linens, filthy carpet, gross tiny bathroom but we had running water and heat so decided to make the most of it. We all (2 couples 2 rooms) headed out on the town upon arriving back at our hotel, the elevator was out of service we were told the stairs were our only choice, 9 stories later exhausted we finally made it to our rooms and literally fell exhausted into our beds, we awoke the next morning only to learn the elevator was still out of service, meaning we got to haul all our luggage down 9 floors, filthy staircase and something all over the stairs of the 4th to the 2nd floor made it treacherous as well. Today being 4 days later my muscles still ache I've yet to hear back from the manager (we requested some sort of a discount) I'm betting we won't hear back and we chalk it up to learning the hard way. I'd much rather stay in a hostel or sleep in a park then ever step foot in this horrid excuse for a hotel again!!!!

I could barely sleep because the place is so ghetto, you sit in your room worried about your safety and your valuables. The elevator crawls up squeeking the whole way with no certificate of inspection or weight limit posted. The room looks like somethig out of the 70s. Holes in the sheets, no toilet paper roll, just sitting on the sink, an old water furnace with peeling paint (is it lead based?). The TV has about 5 working chanels and has a hole in the plastic. The wiring is obviously shoddy and I found a working outlet on my third try. The heat runs so hot and does not adjust. You have to open a window. The window has no screen and I was on the 8th floor (Do Not stay here with a child). The wallpaper was badly peeling, exposing mold and mildew on the walls. I can only imagine how poor the air quality was. No WiFi in the room. The neighbors next to me were having relations loudly and the walls are paper thin. After hearing the walls bang for a few minutes, I had to get some fresh air. The surrounding area is full of homeless and shady characters. There is a terrible bar in the basement that attracts scumbags and white trash who hang out in front of the entrance. The thing is, this room cost me $95!!! I've got great hotels in other major cities, Chicago, NY, Orlando for this range that are great. This is a Roach Motel that is best suited for drug use and prostitution. It should offer hourly rates. I took off my watch and ring just to make sure no one was casing me out. The worst part is that the website is completely misleading.

We selected this hotel purely for the excellent location and for the cost. But frankly we were in for a shock when we arrived at the hotel directly after disembarking from a cruise. There was only one person at the front desk and he bluntly told us that check-in was only after 3pm. Since it was a long wait (we reached the hotel at 11am) we requested that we be allowed to leave our luggage. Luckily he agreed., So we left and returned only later in the evening. There was only one lift and that was so ancient just like everythinhg at the hotel. The room was smelling awful and looked very dull and unwelcoming. There was free wifi only in the lobby. The bathroom was only just adequate as the toilet seat was wobbly and almost broken. There was no kettle or microwave anywhere in the hotel. We just managed to survive for two nights only because it was conveniently located to the Pyke Marketplace ,space needle and the sea front. Luckily there were good restaurants and Starbucks close by .

Very well decorated and the bed was very comfortable. If you need space to spread out this isn't the place for you but if you plan on enjoying the room just as a place to drop your things and go enjoy the city than this is the perfect place. The location was fantastic and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hallways made me feel like I was in a dream. I loved the decor!! Very artistic, not like any other place I have ever stayed. I was a little concerned because I had seen that this hotel was listed on the bed bug report. I called ahead of time to inquire about this issue. I spoke to the general manager who told me that bed bugs have now come to Seattle and they are a problem in the industry and any hotel at any time could have them. He also assured me that they bring in dogs to check the rooms on a regular basis and if any are found they are properly exterminated. I don't think you can ask for anything else. We had no bed bugs in our room! Yea! Anyhow the place is great! I would go back for sure.

The price was very reasonable. The hotel was clean with regards to day to day cleaning - the lobby, corridors, toilet, shower were all clean, and the room was dust free with fresh smelling sheets on the bed, which whilst it was not the most comfy bed I have ever slept in it was OK. Deeper down bits of the hotel have seen better days. There was a rusty pipe and loose wallpaper in the corner of both my friends bathroom and my bathroom, both of our bathrooms had filthy suspended ceilings, there was also a bit of loose wallpaper in my bedroom and the TVs only worked on a few channels, in my room only one non religious channel in fact, and that was the "Opra Winfrey Network" - could not get any morning weather or news. Also the Wifi was in the loby only and it was a nightmare - the man on reception had to keep resetting the router. No breakfast in the hotel, they reccomend you go to the restaurant underneath for breakfast but it sounded expensive to us so we went to a nearby Subway instead. This hotel was OK for us for the price as we spent very little time in the hotel except when asleep.

I stayed one out of two nights, and raised hell to get my money back for the second night. Again- MOLD in the bathroom. the shower backing was coming off the wall, and inside was disgusting, horrible cultures of something I don't know. Like a previous woman stated, I was terrified to sleep with the lights off. I didn't feel safe AT ALL. The entire place was creepy- the lobby is falling apart, the elevator you don't know if it's going to hold you; I felt genuinely scared and uncomfortable. When I got to my room, the windows were open and the oil heater was on. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and suffocated in a hot room when I went to sleep. Eventually had to re-open the windows to hear the loud sirens, trash dumping noises, and strange animal cries at 2 AM. There are NO SCREENS on the windows, so YES, YOU OR YOUR KIDS COULD FALL OUT OF THE WINDOWS. Is that legal? I don't know. There was a metal object in my sheets, the sheets didn't even fit on the bed, the shower water was inconsistent, the bathroom dirty and hot, the hotel service TERRIBLE, holes in the walls, and cracks in the ceilings. The guy acted like I was crazy for asking for a refund. No one was friendly to me. I will never step foot in this terrible place ever again, not to be paid even, as someone else said. No sleep will be gotten here, just a stiff neck and a load of anxiety about the safety of you and your things. Spend a little more for a hotel you can feel safe in.

There are only two hard backed chairs in the room to sit on; otherwise there is only the bed. This hotel in general needs TLC. We observed unfinished repair projects which showed wires sticking out of the light indicator above elevator, unfinished "window transom" above lobby entrance, and lots of little things that wouldn't take much time to finish to give hotel a nicer appearance. Some things were just annoying like the only useful plug-in for an equally useless hairdryer (which you have to check out at the desk, I think they only have one) is on the FAR opposite wall from the mirror in the bathroom. The noise from the hallway sounds as if the people in the hall are in your room with you. It is enough to say the staff could give a rip!!!

We had no option but to use our credit card to cover a one nights stay until it was sorted. We then had to wake up at 3.00am to phone the travel agent (due to the time difference) to try and sort it.

And there is a garage right up the street if there isn't any street parking.

The beds were clean and comfy and I really liked the pillows. The room was cleaned both days and fresh towels delivered. I read all the previous reviews and was concerned but decided it would be an adventure and if nothing else we would have a good story. But after staying there I realized that expectations really vary amongst guests. We felt safe, slept well, had nice staff encounters. If you want luxury, and newer accommodations, then by all means stay at the "mocking" W hotel. But if you were reamed liked we were on the airfare and don't have the money, stay here. Its funky, old, centrally located and has a nice staff. ps. The photographer who shot the lovely photo of the room did and amazing job, and possibly knows a lot about photoshop. Our room paled by comparison. But that's OK<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17238037">My family and I were traveling to Seattle for the graduation of our niece. This was a special time for us. A member of the family looked on the web for a hotel close to the graduation facility. All looked well on the internet for moderate priced accomodations for three nights. We called them directly and booked the stay. The staff was very nice and none of this review is meant to reflect on the them in any way. We understood that this was a moderate priced placed to stay but did not expect the what we found. The rooms are dark and dank and look like something that comes out of film noir. The bathroom had paper rolling off of the walls; it took two to three flushes for the toilet to flush. it was the most depressing place I have ever stayed in. We knew immediately upon arrival in the room that we could not stay there for 3 nights, so we took steps to find other acommodations and were fortunate to find them. We had to stay one night and I spent that entire time awake. We were at the nearest coffee shop at 5:30 a.m. and left in a taxi by 8:30 a.m. I write this review out of concern for others who plan to stay there. It was not a pleasant experience. Beware.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8885729">After struggling to find a hotel with rooms free at a very busy time of year we eventually found the Hotel Seattle. It is in a great location and half the price of most other hotels in the area. The room was clean although the decor was slightly old-fashioned. Staff were friendly and helpful trying to help out with information about the local area at various times of the day and night. If you just want somewhere to sleep and as a base to explore Seattle this hotel is perfect. If you want somehwere a bit more stylish that will charge you at least twice the price then Seattle has plenty of choice!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8862054">the only good thing was location. the staff was rude, unhelpful, and didn't have knowledge of the area. the tub had black foot prints upon arrival, the towels were old and ratty with holes in them, and the room had a musty smell. the TV only got a clear picture half the time on one channel. the bathroom sink was "movable" and the toilet was very small, had exposed pipes. no AC so had to sleep with the windows open and downtown Seattle is extremely noisy at night. only one attendant in the entire hotel at night. would not stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8698929">for the price i paid...it was okay. spent 2 nights there before going off to family's home about 45 mins away for additional 2 days. didn't want to bother them because we were there for the weekend (wedding). just wanted place to sleep and store belongings while shopping and sightseeing seattle. room run down. very dark - dark brown/dark orange/maroonish color decor. but clean. had running hot water. no problems with bath/toilet...clean and functional. tv sucked though. could only catch 2 stations and they were pretty much snowflaked. got free internet wifi from next door hotel (monaco i think). definitely not elderly or handicap friendly with stairs to get into lobby and no ramp. but i paid for location without breaking my bank account. doubt ill stay there again...i might pay extra 50-75 a night next time around.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8656807">The only decent thing about this hotel is the location, which is excellent, I've stayed in better value hostels. The room was dirty, the ceiling plaster had a great chunk missing over the bed and the shower backing was falling off the wall The staff were just not interested. The decor dated from the 1970's and was all various shades of brown, grim and depressing Only stayed one night , then found somewhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8190161">You will have better accommodations. With a name like Hotel Seattle I expected that they would take more pride in their establishment. My room was falling apart. From the baseboard coming off, to the unfinished shower, and not to mention, the unfinished pipes leading into a cut out hole in the floor. In the height of summer there was no A.C. and the only way to get some cool air was to open the window onto the busy street. I will never recommend Hotel Seattle and made sure none of the guest at the wedding I attended will go there either.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5824319">Thankfully we only stayed one night at the Hotel Seattle. Our room was an absolute disgrace.....very tatty witha layer of dust on most furniture. The bathroom had to be seen to be believed. The bath was old with ingrained dirt, the sink wobbled and leaked at the base. The floor tiles had a few decades ago seen better days. The shower head was loose.............the list is endless. We payed$96 plus tax. For that amount I expected a basic clean room. I have stayed in many hotels over the years and I can truly say that this hotel ranks as the worst I have ever stayed in. Whilst the location is handy for many of the tourist sights, it is not the best area to wander around at night and we felt quite uneasy doing so. I wish I had consulted Trip Advisor before staying there. Stay away!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5808628">The staff was nice. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this place. The photos of the hotel are very misleading. Standing outside looking at the hotel, you have to wonder if the photo on their website has been doctored at all. The photos of the rooms were obviously taken at a different hotel because the room I was put in, and then moved to another looked NOTHING like the room photos on their website. As someone else said in a previous review about this hotel, don't walk around the room without your shoes and socks on. Definitely not a romantic getaway (unless you're trying to break up with someone.) The sheets had hair on them. I requested a non-smoking room, but you could tell that someone had smoked in it previously. There was no air condtioning or a fan. Big deal, it's Seattle, right? Wrong. It was 90 plus degrees during my stay. The windows do open though, providing little relief. Cable television? Non-existant. I was told that sometimes it comes in, and sometimes it doesn't. What does that mean, really? It's sad when you pay $96 a night and can't even get the local channels (NBC, ABC, CBS.) Go on the internet for your news? There is no internet, unless you want to setup your laptop for dialup. The restaurant downstairs was a dive. Again, the service was great, but as with the rooms, you could tell that management didn't quite care about upgrading anything. Several times during my meal, I could have swore I saw something scurrying across the floor. The waitress seemed embarrassed while attempting to relieve me of my worries. I forgot to mention the lobby. The sofa was very comfortable. In fact, it may have been the nicest thing in the entire hotel. However, don't lean your head back while on the sofa or you'll notice that there is paint peeling off the ceiling in large chunks held together by duct tape in places. Speaking of duct tape, there was actually duct tape holding the carpet together in several places. The room I stayed in had scotch tape holding the wallpaper over this gaping hole. Security risk? Room keys have the room number and hotel name on the key ring. So, don't bring anything valuable, because who knows how often the locks are changed and if previous customers have lost their keys on drinking binges in Pioneer Square. There is no room service. It looked like there was only one person there at all times. If you're hungry, don't eat the food in the vending machine. Both the pretzels and Twix candybar were past their expiration date. At check out, staff was apologetic for the things I told them, but obviously not at fault. While you could sense their understandable frustration through their body language (not quite making eye contact, embarrased look on their face), you got the feeling that they hear about similar guest experiences on a regular basis. It's a shame because it's in a great location. You almost wonder if management is even in it to make money. I never did hear back from them after I sent a letter detailing my disappointments. I highly recommend not staying here. Avoid at all costs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5717919">What a relief! I blindly booked this by calling the hotel - they only had a suite - and got a great rate. Our room was clean (a few carpet stains in corners, no big deal), huge, smoke-free, had a kitchenette (microwave) and was in the middle of downtown. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant attached was excellent for breakfast, comfortable enough beds, and the location was quiet at night. Our room was right next to the elevator, and even that was inaudible! Cons - parking can be a nightmare - its street or city parking garage only, which can be costly ($20/day); not much of a view; some of the floors look like they might not have been updated - ask for one that has (and a suite!); only one elevator for about 11 floors); not too generous on the extra amenities (towels, shampoo, pillows) - if you ask, you get what you need though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4446350">This hotel is realli aweful, is the worse one i had choose from. i stay here just because at that time all hotels are full. therefore i stayed one night at there. Its horrible. u cannot image the carpet is green colour and kinda bug bites. and the ceiling is broken, also, the TV is kinda 1950's one, they should UPGRADE a new one okay? i haven't seen this kinda of OLD TV, and only can watch one or two channels and the colour from that TV is worse. The telephone is realli old. The elevator is worse than ever. and the light whether outside and inside all deem, not dark...realli terrify me to stay at there, its kinda hunting house. the service is not quite good also. do you need to choose cheap hotel, nice and clean one, u should choose 6 Ave Inn, that quite good i stay there for two nights be4 this hotel seattle. realli a nightmare for me.

If you are elderly, you may have issues with this but for most people it will not be an issue. This hotel pretty much only has its location going for it. It is an old hotel, which is pretty rundown. It did have clean sheets, which is basically what we were looking for. Did I walk around barefoot on the carpet or bathroom floor, the answer is no. A little dirty/dingy but ok for a place to sleep. For the price in downtown, its hard to beat. Also, be advised they have no parking (typical for seattle), there are 2 huge parking garages though within a block or two of the hotel so you shouldn't have issues with that.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3606876">The location is unmatchable in this price range. A simple sleeping room is $80 but expect to pay 2x's that anywhere else. It was surprisingly cleaner than most hotels I've seen in the past week but I've been driving up from LA and staying at Travelodge and Days Inn and Motel 6. The quality of the furnishings was high. Sure, it's a little run down in spots but it's just an old building with some of the usual character flaws but none affected the comfort. We were lucky enough also to get a corner room so that made it especially nice to look over at the W and know they are paying $250+/night. It had a full bath, everything worked -- we don't care to watch tv anyway on vacation so have no idea how that worked but if you want to believe all the other comments, feel free. It will mean more room for us when we come back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3499277">Avoid this hotel at all costs. Even at half the price, it would still be throwing money away. While the location is very desirable, it is in disrepair, ugly, unclean, and generally unpleasant. The toilet in my room malfunctioned daily. The television would only pick up two stations. Although I had a great time with a friend in Seattle, I was happy to leave this hotel. It should not have a star rating at all.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2226877">I don't know how this hotel can get away with a description like: "All of the guest rooms have been remodeled in a relaxing decor" (from expedia), when the only thing that seemed to have been updated since the 1970s is the television. There is no room for toiletries in the bathroom, and the tiny pillows were very lumpy. If you don't mind staying at a Super 8 or Motel 6, you should stay here. Otherwise, I suggest you spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR1275352">Pros: Good safe downtown location. Walking distance to market, downtown stores, etc. Room and bathroom were clean. Request the non-smoking floor. Pleasant desk staff. Two coffee places around the corner.

You drive up to a little spot in front of a little sign and the bell boys quickly did everything perfectly including holding baggage after I checked out. Parking otherwise is quite a pain. I enjoyed the deck on top. I decided not to pay extra for a view room. I figured I'd look at the street and that would be fine. Be sure you don't get room #404.

It is within steps of the Market. We received a double room on the fourth floor, where both windows either looked out over the sound or the market. I couldn't have gotten a better view! It was beautiful. The beds were actually very comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. Maid service daily did a great job picking up after our family. And turn down service left us a local candy on our night stands. The champagne, the cappucinno, and the milk chocolate were the best. The concierge night men were so friendly and helpful. They even had umbrellas to loan out, which was great since one of ours broke in the wind the first night. The only negative I have is the room service menues. The breakfast from Bacco's was just ok. And the night menu from the french restaurant was so limited none of us found anything at all interesting, which resulted in a quick walk to McDonald's instead.

We had a free upgrade to a waterfront room our first night at the Inn. The bellhops were great, and the front desk staff were very warm and inviting. However, the $35 dollars a day seemed a bit steep for valet parking (albeit the staff was very prompt in pulling our car up); was hoping there would be a cheaper parking alternative near by. However, when we checked out of the hotel (after a 3 day stay) we left our netbook, in a case, on the bed of the room. We did not realize it was gone till later in the day,but came rushing back to get it when we did. The laptop NEVER made it out of our room in our possession. It's "lost" and we are $600+ dollars in the hole. The staff made every attempt to find it, searching lost and found, the safe, sending out an e-mail to all staff etc. But we honestly feel it may have been taken from the room by housekeeping. We left very disheartened and angry. I have a feeling we won't be getting it back and someone has a nice new password protected netbook, (among other things in the netbook case) that they are going to have to reformat to be able to use. I called back to follow up with the manager once we returned. She said nothing was turned in. Also, she suggested I call the Washington State Ferry lost and found. I did, with no avail. I know the laptop never made it on the ferry, because it never made it to our car.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126229876">Stayed at Inn at the Market November 2011 for a Seattle Seahawks game.

Was cold when we were there, so the deck you could sit on overlooking the Sound wasn't used, but its views were excellent. Valet parking was fast and efficient as well. Rooms were modern and clean as well. Great to be right on Post Alley as well and steps from Kells Irish Pub. Go there for great local bands.

We booked a city view room, really wished we had booked a water view, but the property was full 2 of the nights so there wasn't an opportunity to upgrade. We were on the top floor, which was a wonderful bonus, but bring your earplugs, the night noise was pretty loud, especially after businesses closed on Saturday night (Sunday am).

We were fortunate to be able to change our rooms after the first night to a water view room and the view was stunning. It was so nice to watch the sun set over the water. Huge Bathroom which was very clean. The one small down side was the area of the hotel and not with the hotel itself which I have marked down the location below. As tourists we walked everywhere, returning home from town at night was a little bit daunting sometimes as there were quite a few people that hang around pike and pine street in groups.

The staff is welcoming and go out of their way to accommodate their guests..."welcome back!" is the usual greeting when we arrive.

This is an older "boutique" hotel, so the rooms are not exactly large, but they are kept clean and tidy, although the furnishing are a bit dated but are in keeping with the style of the hotel. The front desk staff for the most part is quite helpful, especially at arranging a limo (at a good price) to and from the airport or for other excursions. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side (average room is probably about $250 a night), but if you are lucky enough to get a room with a view of the market and Elliott Bay, then it's worth it.

We had a wonderful experience. I chose the hotel based on it's location, I had never stayed at a "boutique" type hotel so didn't know what to expect. Our room was exceptional, we stayed in room 808 which offers a great view of the market and of Puget Sound. I don't think we could have asked for a better room. The service from everyone at the hotel was oustanding, I have never experienced this level of customer service, and I have stayed at numerous hotels. Everyone is s0 incredibly nice, and it's genuine! From the desk clerks to Andrew who gave us a ride to the Space Needle, everyone was provided steller customer service. Since we didn't have out own vehicle, we appreciated having the hotel town car available to give us a ride. If I had to find fault with anything it would probably be that the water pressure to fill the bath tub is a little slow. Other than that it was perfect. I would caution those traveling with kids, this is a boutique hotel which means that it does not offer some of the amenities that your larger resort style hotesl offer, ie, pool, spa, etc. I would definately stay here again and would recommend it.

We had plenty of room in the hotel fridge to store our small amount of travel snacks and drinks. The concierge was helpful in suggesting a place to eat, and we explored the area surrounding the hotel, which happens to be smack in the middle of the Public Market at Pike Place.

After perusing the reviews of various Seattle hotels here on Trip Advisor, I decided to book us at the Inn at the Market. We were very pleased with our choice! Our room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the water, the bed was quite comfortable, enough to make it difficult to get up in the mornings. The bathroom was clean and spacious, stocked daily with Gilchrist &amp; Soames toiletries. My only beef with the bathroom was that the shower was incorporated into the tub, it was just a little bit inconvenient, but it didn't detract from the quality of our stay. Housekeeping was quite thorough, our room was always well cleaned daily. The door men were always amiable and helpful, and so were the front desk staff. The hotel had no restaurants, but it was within a little courtyard that also included the superb Cafe Campagne which served lovely French cuisine (We had dinner two nights in a row!); Bacco, a cafe that was only open for breakfast, which was quite satisfying; and Marche which we patronized every night for desert and drinks after dinner. There were also some interesting looking shops and a salon in the courtyard which I was never able to visit because by the time we would get back from training, they were all closed. The staff at Cafe Campagne and Marche were very friendly and helpful. We thought my husband left his cellphone at Marche on our last night and the staff helped him turn the place around to search for it. We loved Seattle and Inn at the Market, and would like to come back for sure!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124928457">We recently spent our 20th wedding anniversary here and realized that we have done more anniversaries here than anywhere else. The Inn's location is wonderful with Pike Place Market and 1st Avenue so close; lots to see and do. The rooms are large and full of light, the bed was wonderfully comfortable, and staff were helpful and friendly. We had reserved a city view room but when they found it was our anniversary, gave us a free upgrade to a water view room - and a deliciious chocolate dessert in our room. The rooftop deck expands the view even more and is a great place to spend time. We spent time at the Market, had a martini at the Triple Door (live happy hour music, no cover) and a delicious dinner at Chez Shea. We love the Inn and I'm sure we'll be back!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124888254">The inn was the perfect location for a weekend in Seatlle, it's close to shops, restaurants and entertainment,great price too.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124835510">My husband and I stayed February 12th until February 15th, 2012. We had a water view room at the rate of $245 per night/ $855 with tax. The room was clean and the staff terrific. We had a poorly operating coffee pot and it was immediately replaced with one that worked. The pillows were too soft, so we asked if we could have an extra one. The staff immediately came up with two tempurpedic pillows. I was impressed. When we got home we were asked by management to take a survey regarding our stay. I happened to mention the refusal of the Orange Cab driver, who took us to the airport, to give us the flat rate of $32, as stated on the cab's passenger window and confirmed by another cab driver, who had told us rates are metered when coming FROM the airport but charged a flat rate when GOING to the airport. Our cab driver stated we needed a form, provided by the hotel, in order to get the rate. Not true! I had also researched cab fares on the internet before leaving home. The manager of the Inn at the Market advised he would refer this cab incident to the transporation authority. I also sent an e-mail to Orange Cab advising I would not use their company in the future. I have not heard back for them---Go figure. Anyway, the only negative I have regarding our stay was the decor of our room. I actually laid in bed thinking a change in the pictures on the wall and the curtains would help. The room has a bit of a tired look and not pulled together. I also had an issue with the blower on the heater. It is winter and it is possible dust was blown into the air, as my eyes instantly acted up, when the heater went on. Would I stay there again or even recommend the hotel to friends--of course. You can't beat the location and everyone was happy to please. I also appreciated the secure office center, in order to print up our boading passes.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124581830">This place spends its money where it counts-the beds are fantastic, the sheets divine, the pillows cloud-like...and of course, the location can't be beat. But frankly, that is all that recommends the place--outside of what I mentioned, the rooms are rather plebeian, at best. We had a street side room, which was tiny, and the water pressure SUcked--could barely rinse my hair. The bathrooms need a make-over--they look like what they probably are--spiffied-up Holiday Innish. At the very least, make sure that the fixtures aren't falling off the wall. We had a TERRible tip from front desk staff about where to go to eat, so don't bother asking--they either don't know or they get a kickback--either way, they are not to be trusted. WE paid $160 a night, including valet parking, which for the location (and those sheets and bed--ahhhhh) still seemed reasonable for Seattle. Yes, I'd go back--just for the sleep and location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124544360">Absolutely love the central location - close to bus routes and shopping.

Literally steps from the Pike Place Market and close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The first night here was a bit rough as we had a city view room (only room available at the time of my reservation). Well, it's not a view as much as a room facing 1st street. It was very loud. Traffic noise until way past 1am! Needless to say I was "Sleepless in Seattle". The next morning I called the front desk and luckily they were able to move us to a "Courtyard Room". Much better! This was a bigger room and quiet. The rooms are comfortable and modest in size-the bed was excellent. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. There is no gym or pool on the property which is a negative for my family but they do give you a free pass to a local gym. Coffee and tea are provided in the lobby in the morning and apples and cookies are on a plate by the front desk in the afternoon. There are 2 restaurants you can order room service from but no children's menu or child friendly food. Luckily, there are so many restaurants close by we were able to get what we needed. Nice rooftop patio area to enjoy the view. I guess this review is fairly neutral-It's a nice hotel BUT...after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor I guess I was just expecting more.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124155030">Staff actually made you feel wanted and as result - very comfortable.

Receptionist and Bell Man both extremely friendly and helpful and our room was ready for us. The first impression was outstanding and the lobby had a delicious aroma... Complimentary coffee, fruit and cookies were on offer as well. We had booked a parlour suite which was a lovley big room with a good sized seperate sitting area, we had a great view of the market and out to the Sound. The room was very nicely appointed, bed was very comfortable, bathroom good although the shower could have used a bit more water pressure. There was also a good sized fridge so you could buy drinks outside the hotel and keep them cold. The concierge arranged a tour to the Boeing Factory for us which was very worthwhile, the Museum of Flight was absolutely outstanding as well. The best meal we had was at Wild Ginger, about a ten minute walk, also enjoyed Steelhead Diner across the road, Elliots Oyster House on one of the wharfs and we also enjoyed Etta's which is right near the market. Would not hesitate to return if we find ourselves in Seattle again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123358740">The staff of this small hotel were very responsive and professional. I stayed for about 5 nights while in town for a conference. The location is great - scenic and walkable area. Moments from great restaurants, shops, museums, and the Market. I had a duplex suite with a kitchenette a huge living/dining room and 2nd floor ensuite bedroom. There was enough room for a family (though mine were not with me) and plenty of room to have colleagues over for a drink without feeling like you were entertaining in your bedroom. Furnishings were tasteful and modern, two large TVs, and bath, luxurious. The shared roof terrace is a great bonus - colleagues and I shared a bottle of wine and watched the view for hours. The only downside was the extra scrutiny my expense report received after my bosses saw my posh digs (they stayed at the Marriott waterfront in standard rooms for the same price). One final note - if you are staying anywhere in Seattle, try to get a fridge and coffeee maker (if not a full kitchen) so that you can try out the amazing produce, coffees, and cheeses and bakery items that area available at the marketplace. And be sure to pick up a GIANT bouquet of fresh flowers for $5-15.

The rooms are great. This time we stayed on the City side, but have stayed on the Market/Puget Sound side in the past. In either case, the rooms are great.

The hotel is a boutique style with an open courtyard to the front. On entering you are met with nice fire and seating area. The staff are young an very attentive and knowledgable. Something that seems to be consistant with Seattle but here they were over and above. We were met with cookies that had just come out of the oven which was a nice touch. The room was fantastic, very nice furniture, well stocked coffee/mini bar area and great media. Big 42 inch flat screen with good movie selection and alarm / speaker with iPhone connectivitivy. Free wi fi as well. We asked for recommendations for dinner and were given three options. We tried an Italian called The Red Door - amazing. the hotel is a short walk (10 mins) to the old town which I would also recommend for its cool independent shops. A great city, a great hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120848799">Right on top of Pike's Market and close to the 'waterfront' shopping - this hotel is small and convenient, comfortable and cozy. It is not 'the best' - but, it is perfect for 1 or 2 nights stay. Rooms are a little dated and cookie-cutter and bordering on boring - beds are comfortable, bathrooms are functional - but, the hotel overall lacks any signature features or stand-out elements. Service was friendly (Noel was wonderful, and the valet service was speedy and efficient) - however, the hotel needs an injection of warmth and personality.

It has a great location and the bellman/valet personnel are wonderful, but the hotel overall is average. Nothing special about the service or the hotel. It is a small, somewhat tired property and we were surprised to find ourselves in the handicapped room. The front desk attendant failed to ask if this was acceptable (which, in my experience, is always usually done...even at the Hampton Inn level hotel). My husband couldn't get his head under the shower head without bending over and since it was the handicapped "removable" type shower head it had trouble staying in place. It would slip out of the holder and proceed to flood the bathroom floor since there was no shower ledge separating the shower from the rest of the bathroom floor. We wouldn't stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120498020">I always travel with my own down pillow as I usually hate hotel pillows.

The bed was firm with a soft topping.. great for a good night's sleep and perfect for a back that has walked all day. The location is so good that you really can walk most places from here. Staff were all way above average, professional and pleasant. I had a room with a "partial view" of the ocean. Actually I had a spectacular view as I had 3 windows and the city was just as interesting. Lots of natural light was a real plus for me.

But I was truly disappointed. Although the Bellman were superb, the front desk personnel and concierge were sorely lacking in being service-oriented. When asking for a suggestion of a nearby restaurant, I had to ask several questions just to get the name of one restaurant across the street which had a 2.5 hour wait and had been told by this front desk rep that we would not need reservations. On a few occasions during our two-day stay, one of us asked for suggestions and it was like pulling teeth just to get a suggestion. They were never rude but just not helpful as you might expect from personnel at a fine hotel.

Wish we could have stayed longer!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116689880">After reading the various reviews from many travel websites, including TA, I chose to make reservations at this quaint boutique hotel because of its location adjacent to Pike's Place Market. The only downside to being in this crowded vicinity was that the site of the hotel was on a very small lot sandwiched between stores and other apartment buildings. It just felt a little too claustrophobic. The compensation for this dilemma is the wonderful common balcony area on the second floor which overlooked Pike's Place Market partially and afforded a full view of Seattle Harbor. On the flipside, because of the location, it was very convenient to grab meals anytime of the day because of the various delis and restaurants in the area. Also, it was walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets, movie theaters and not to mention, the original Starbucks just down the hill. Be wary, though, of the many panhandlers and homeless when walking about. If you have a car, there is no self parking unless, you can find a public parking garage somewhere close by, otherwise the hotel has valet service and there is a parking charge of about $30.00 per night. Despite the fact that the location is in a busy neighborhood, the noise factor was remarkably not an issue, especially since we were on the second floor overlooking the street and stores. We had a room with double beds and ample room for a family with 2 active boys. It was clean and neat, but nothing spectacular. I thought the staff were cordial enough and helpful, but not overly helpful. The place exuded a very low key ambiance. Maybe it was the dim lighting or the fire place in the lobby that contributed to the effect. Overall, the room was decent, the hotel was small, the location was adequate, the atmosphere was sublime and the staff were professional. The room rate is perhaps justified because of the location at Pike's Place Market where everything seems to be overpriced. Not that I had an unpleasant experience at Inn at the Market, mind you, but I probably would try another hotel in Seattle, just for the change in scenery.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116640980">I stayed here in a townhouse city side suite with my wife and 2 kids (2 and 8) on our summer trip. The location is just steps from the market which is great for walking to grab breakfast and dinner and is also close to catch the monorail to some of the activities in the city. The patio for the guests was great. The only improvement we'd like to see is a larger bathroom as it was extremely small and cramped.

There was a little bit of a mixup though and things did not go according to plan BUT they did fix it for me later on and that made all the difference. The room was very clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was really a good size and I liked their amenities as well as the lighted magnifying makeup mirror. There was only 1 nightstand with a lamp though which seemed a little odd. Also, the sound of the aircon was pretty loud so I ended up shutting it off. There was also a strange sound like a whirring of motors that went off and on and was thinking it might have been something coming from the courtyard or maybe the elevators. Not sure if I would stay here again. The Triple Door package is a pretty good deal though so I might still think about that and try it again.

The hotel is directly across from the market and we did have a view of the water, but unless you have a burning desire for this view, the room is not worth the price. The room, while nice, was not worth $400/night. The downstairs is actually a little cramped and, with only one bathroom, it made it a little inconvenient for the 3 of us. You can open the "balcony" door, but you can't go out. It is actually just a window that opens. I really think that you can do better staying further down first street at one of the other hotels.

Before we arrived at the hotel I contacted David Watkins, the manager, to ask if he could possibly arrange that our daughter, who had booked separately, could be accommodated in a room as near to ours as possible. From that point forward we had several email exchanges with both Mr Watkins and Noelle, the concierge, giving us advice and tips about our stay in Seattle. By the time we actually arrived we felt that we knew them so well! Our rooms were close together as requested and they were excellent, very clean and spacious with the most comfortable beds. Because we were celebrating our anniversary a bottle of champagne was in the room when we checked in, a lovely touch. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and couldn't do enough to help you. There was not one thing that we would change with this hotel. The location could not be bettered, a few feet from the market, and with lots of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.

For the price I would have thought the room would have been a little nicer, ie the armoire, tv, art on the walls, and thicker pillows on the bed. The walls in our bathroom were dirty with black scuff marks. Also, our heat blew cooler air for some reason and we only actually felt heat maybe once an hour.

Several times the maid knocked once then barged into the room (early in the morning, no less). On two occasions we phoned the Concierge service for restaurant advice, they said they would phone back and never did. In the spirit of a boutique hotel, they did not have evening/late night dining or room service.

Although Expedia booked us for a city view room, my husband sent a message to the hotel and told them he was willing to pay for an upgrade to a water view room. We never received a response from the hotel despite that fact that he sent the request for an upgrade two and a half months in advance. Finally my husband contacted them a couple of weeks before our trip and they informed us that they had just booked every room. The town car service is a joke. The first time we used it, the driver (who is also the bell hop) didnâ€™t know where the museum was, despite the fact that we had the address and its major cross streets. After driving around the block once, he told us that he needed to get back to the hotel and that maybe we would have better luck finding it on foot. So he dropped us off in the â€œghettoâ€� (he literally dropped us off at the door of a homeless shelter with people loitering, smoking marijuana and talking to themselves). We had no idea where we were or where we needed to be going and we totally stood out. Luckily someone was able to point us in the right direction. The driver had dropped us off about four blocks away from where we asked to go. Had I been that driver I would have at least called the hotel and asked if they could have provided me with directions, not dropped the tourist off in a highly questionable neighborhood telling them that typically the bums donâ€™t cause people trouble during the day as a reassurance! Our second experience with the town car was even worse. We had a dinner reservation at the Space Needle for our anniversary and when we inquired about using the town car, we were told that due to the Sea Fair Torch parade and traffic being difficult to navigate that they couldn't be bothered with the town car. (As tourist, one of the times you need a courtesy car the most is when traffic and typical routes are difficult to navigate due to a special event!) At this point we asked what they recommended we do and they suggested a cab or the monorail. We thought maybe the hotel company had a specific cab company they used, but no, they just hail whatever cab happens to be driving by and because the streets were closing down for the parade not a lot of cabs were going by. We ended up taking the monorail which is about five or six blocks away from the hotel. On our walk back to the hotel after dinner we had the pleasure of walking by a â€œsuspectedâ€� gang shooting as it took place (two blocks away from the hotel). We were walking when we heard seven gunshots and suddenly we were surrounded by suspected gang members and police officers with guns and TAZERS drawn. Checking the Seattle Times, we were relieved to learn that only one person was wounded and no one had died, but it obviously wasnâ€™t the end to our anniversary night that we had hoped for. With the amount of money we were paying for the room (not to mention the $25 a day to â€œvaletâ€� the car), I really expected superior service. The view was the best part and it was only "nice", it wasnâ€™t worth all the money we were paying. Either they have really poor customer service standards or they treated us poorly because we booked through Expedia, either way I will not recommend that hotel to anyone. It just wasnâ€™t worth the money in the long run. To be honest the whole experience really tarnished what otherwise was a wonderful anniversary.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR35741039">This hotel offered a Pike Place FIsh Market package that allowed us to go "behind" the scenes at the fish market. My son was able to toss and catch a fish and all of the guys working there were so fun. This was a highlight of our trip. The Inn and the Market is only hotel to offer this special feature and it was definitely worth it. The location is perfect too - near the market shops and restaurants - and near lots of the downtown's fabulous restaurants &amp; other shops - and walking distance to harbor. A great stay!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR34650970">Just returned from 4 nights at the Inn at the Market with my spouse and teenage son. I had reserved a waterview room, and needed a rollaway bed for my son. Room was nice, but 3rd floor view of water included the roof of the next door building (not picturesque). We inquired if a larger room might be available, and were told that all rooms were the same size. Therefore I'm confused as to other reviews which discuss "huge" rooms. Location is wonderful, but room and staff were not at all as impressive. As one other reviewer mentioned awhile back, the water pressure in shower is awful, the tub is tiny so that a shower always involved the curtain sticking to me, our sink drained so slowly it was rather unpleasant to look at! Also, the air conditioner is very noisy when it goes on/off during the night, often waking us up. The queen bed was comfortable, but awfully squeaky. I'm not usually one to complain, but I feel that I had to add this review to counter all the wonderful ones I read before booking this hotel. Staff was nice enough, but not at all helpful - in fact, the only restaurant that was ever recommended to us was Cutters down the street - we wondered if they were getting paid to do this! (Cutters is ok, but nothing to rave about). When I asked for another casual restaurant for salads/sandwiches, one young man at the desk even said there weren't restaurants like that in Seattle.... something I find hard to believe. Everyone on staff seemed more like college kids in summer jobs, not professionals who know the city. Sorry to burst any bubbles, but other than the location near the market, this hotel is not one I would recommend.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34452014">Our stay at the Inn at the Market was a delightful culmination of much planning by my partner and Noelle, a concierge at the hotel. When we arrived, our room had been upgraded to a 7th floor water view room (a birthday surprise from my partner) that overlooked the deck on the fifth floor. The room was spacious and quiet with a sliding glass window that actually opened! We were able to enjoy the sounds of the city and the cool breezes or shut the door and enjoy the quiet. The view was always beautiful. The hotel staff's attention to detail and impeccable service only added to our enjoyment.

The hotel also has a rooftop deck that is perfect for a bottle of wine with a great view of the harbor. The rooms (as of 2005) really needed an update. For the price I paid, I expected a bit more from the room. Also, if you rent a car, you pretty much HAVE to valet it and its not cheap. Bottom line, great location for action, but ask if the rooms have been updated before you stay!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34267272">Our room wasn't quite ready at check in, they held our luggage after suggesting we could have another room, but the concierge recommended we wait for the one we'd been assigned.

We were disappointed. Nonexistent concierge service is one of our gripes. Also, for an 8 story "boutique" hotel where you would expect above average service, we were surprised to see the note that we must make our room available by 9:00 AM or we would not be serviced AT ALL! Hey, we're on vacation, would like to sleep later. Food recommendation for breakfast by the front desk staff was awful. We did better with coffe and croissants in Pike Place Market. I'm just glad we chose a less expensive street view room rather than the $325 one.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19944128">We were spending four days in Seattle prior to flying to Alaska, and after reading many reviews of different Seattle hotels, I chose this hotel on the basis of the Tripadvisor reviews. Every review I saw was glowing, and I also liked the location. We travel frequently and have stayed in many different hotels, both chain and otherwise. I have to say we were somewhat disappointed. The location is very nice, true. The hotel was nice inside, but we never saw the reason for the glowing reviews. The room was nice but not exceptional. The men who bring in luggage and get you cabs went to great lengths to help us. The desk staff was certainly very pleasant and helpful, but at least two of them didn't know how to put us in touch with a company who could take us to Mt. Rainier. There are no brochures available in the lobby, and when the desk person went looking in a drawer, he had difficulty finding a brochure for this major attraction. I finally suggested Gray Line myself, and he made the phone call for us, but then gave us incorrect information (and I saw later why he thought that he was accurate---I don't blame him for that). My husband found out later on that there was a concierge somewhere on site, but in four days we never saw him/her or even knew of his/her presence. The hotel needs better visible information for tourists---at the very least, brochures should be somewhere. In addition, once we did book our tour, we asked for a wake up call that never came. Fortunately I always set my cell phone. We came away feeling that while our stay there was fine, we had had similar "fine" experiences in the chain hotels all over the US. We felt that it wasn't worth the extra money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19359721">We just returned from a weekend stay at the Inn. We wanted a great room in a great location as we were without a car. This is THE place to stay in Seattle if you are interested in wandering the streets on foot and sightseeing the Pike Place Market neighborhood. You are right across the street from the Market and in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. It is only about a few blocks to West Lake Centre and the monorail to the Space Needle. When you get tired of strolling around this great city just head back to your beautiful room at the Inn. If you are wondering where good customer service has gone, look no further. The Inn has obviously put alot of effort into hiring/training customer focused staff.

However, I had the absolute worst room in the entire hotel. They said, "city view". I had a view of a red brick wall. After a long day of travel, I wanted a bath. They had given me a handicapped room. The room was larger than say a Hilton and nice appointments, but nothing special. No one ever asked how my stay way or I would have told them. If they had let me know the room was so so it might have helped. I don't think they were even close to full either. I was on the floor with the conference rooms. What a joy in the morning.

I didn't think I would ever give that to any hotel. This place is amazing! Perfect location, incredible rooms, and the finest men and women in customer service I've ever experienced. We check in, and immediately people know you by name and greet you. Every day I was greeted, and everything I needed was retrieved immediately. I got to my room. The toilet was running slightly, so I called down and it was fixed, including replacement parts, within a matter of minutes. I needed a rollaway for an extra guest.. it was provided at turndown later that evening and was turned down and made like a regular bed. I needed an extension cord, as we had two laptops and a assortment of other devices to plug in. It was at my room within 2 or 3 minutes. The bed was a firmer variant of the memory foam beds, and was amazing. They only offer queen size beds in this hotel, but since I was single this time around, that wasn't an issue. I never slept better in a hotel. The bathroom was amazing. It was half the size of the room, at least, and had plenty of space for 2 people and their toiletries. It had several lighting options as well. You could change it from late night to boardroom with an assortment of switches. In addition, I felt the supplied soaps and shampoos were excellent and felt no need to augment them. Every hallway, restroom, and staff member was immaculate in apperance and maintenance. I was not missing anything and I DID NOT want to leave.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15080153">Stayed here earlier this week and from the beginning met with annoying customer service staff - Felix especially a drama queen - and less than stellar accomodations.

Our room was a standard one, with a somewhat disappointing view of the wall of the building across the courtyard, on the 3rd floor. Not a big deal, since we could go up to the rooftop terrace if we wanted a great view. I will say the best thing about the Inn was the location. Pike Place Market is a great place to leisurely explore, and it's right there. My husband walked down across the street every morning to get fresh hot croissants and coffee for breakfast, and we visited the bakeries many times for late night snacks. My biggest complaint was the Tempurpedic mattress. Everyone else in these reviews rave about them, but my back hated it! I have chronic low back pain anyway (and was 6 months pregnant when we went), and was really looking forward to some great sleep, but wound up hurting terribly. In fact, I wound up having to sleep sitting up in bed because laying down was so painful. On our 3rd day there I asked the person at the front desk if I could get a cot in my room because the bed was really uncomfortable to me and they told me it was against fire code. I don't know if that's the truth or not, but it sure wasn't what I wanted to hear. They didn't seem to care too much that a pregnant patron wasn't able to sleep at all on their beds. Smaller complaints: my husband and I stopped at the front desk to ask directions from Discovery Park over to the zoo, two of the places we were planning on visiting. The girl handed us a Budget rental car map and circled each place on there for us. She didn't try to help us out with the best route to take from one to the next, even though we asked, just pointed out each place again as if to brush us off. Obviously we can read a map and did find our way, but I was once again disappointed in the service. Also, the room was very noisy due to all the street noise, especially in the morning as trucks unloaded their stuff for the day at the market. It didn't bother us too badly, because we sleep with a white noise machine which helps to mask it. I can't imagine the racket we would have had to listen to without it. So be aware of that potential problem. Overall, our experience was still pleasant, though, mostly due to the location of the hotel. The room was clean, the bathroom large and nicely stocked, and the terrace view was really amazing. However, we can't go back because of the beds which is a shame. They should offer some rooms without the Tempurpedic mattresses.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8866186">The inn is billed as a boutique hotel, however the room lacked charm. It was so generic, it felt like we were at a Holiday Inn (but for $300+ a night). It would be so easy for the hotel to add a few prints of the Public Market or original paintings sold at Pike Place...something that had to do with Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. Our room had a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. The Tempur Pedic bed was very comfortable, however the sales brochures for the mattress in the nightstand was a big turn-off. The bathroom was very large and stocked with top notch products. The front lobby and housekeeping staff were very helpful and room service arrived in record speed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8588606">My husband &amp; I just got back yesterday from Seattle.

The hotel's location (literally) next to Pike Place Market is ideal! You can walk around the market to explore yet still walk around the city quite easily. The hotel is a bit on the expensive side, but really has a lot of qualities that make it very desirable. The rooftop terrace is awesome! The rooms sometimes have a weird arrangement (i.e. TV was at the side of the bed, so you had to lay on the bed sideways to watch). But overall the rooms were very nice with comfortable bedding, updated furniture, complimentary in-room internet access. The guest service was also excellent. Our check-in/check-out was pleasant and quick. The bell staff, valet parking staff, and housekeeping were always very helpful, timely, and accomodating. They also have a complimentary car service that can drop off/pick up for intown locations. Overall, we had a great stay and would certainly stay at this property again while visiting Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8231080">The simple fact is the hotel's location is simply unbeatable.. a mere stone's throw away from Pike Market. Plenty of great restaurants to go to and it is generally a fun area to be in. That is if you are a tourist. However, the quality of the hotel itself is only so-so. This is not a place for business travellers. I might be a bit hard on them especially since I just returned from a trip to HK where I stayed at the Conrad HK and Wynn Macau. Compared to those the Inn feels like motel 6. Issues: 1. There is no desks in the rooms to place your laptops on. Even if you have wireless internet, there is no place to work on but your bed. 2. Furniture and coverings are worned and just outdated. 3. Room 409 is a city view room. The last room they had for that date. Avoid at all cost because its window sits right above the bus stop. They claim that the windows are double paned but I could hear the buses' roaring engines. I had to sleep with ear plugs which they had at the front desk. 4. The AC is a standalone unit attached to the wall. This is not part of a central system. The standalone unit made quite a bit of noise. It looks cheap and tacky too. 5. There is no business center. Only a fax machine located in the basement of the hotel. For the price you pay you are paying for the location only. The staff are extremely friendly though. Folks should check out the fried doughnuts at the Dhalia Lounge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8183475">This was my fifth or sixth visit to the Inn at the Market. The property is better than most: the lobby is handsome, the rooms comfortable (though a little tired and ready for renovation, especially in the case of the bathrooms), the sun deck overlooking the harbor is a treat, and the staff is welcoming. The related restaurants, including not only Campagne but the related bistro in the basement and the lively breakfast place located separately within the same building, are really good. But the whole ballgame here is the location. The views, if you are fortunate enough to have a water-view room, are simply stunning -- not only because of the comings and goings of ferry boats, freighters, liners, Coast Guard cutters, fishing boats, and pleasure craft, but also because of the astonishing mountain range visible across Elliott Bay, which catches the sunset in truly glorious ways. It is also a pleasure to be able to walk half a block down the steep hill to the Pike Place Market, with all its produce and its bustle of activity. There are countless restaurants and clubs within walking distance. As gentrification neuters most of downtown Seattle, this area remains edgy, even a little challenging if you go in certain directions at certain times. The area is not for you if you are uncomfortable with street people and occasional strong smells. It is also a little inconvenient for business; and the business services in the hotel are not comparable to those in a Hyatt or a Marriott. But the tradeoff is a real sense of place, something you can't get in other cities or in Seattle's uptown hotels.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8136002">This hotel is in a terrific location half a block from the Pike Place Market and within walking distance of most downtown attractions. It's located on a steep hill (see photos) with a courtyard and ocean view patio. Our room faced the patio and ocean - great for sunsets. The bed was memory foam so my pregnant wife loved it and slept like a charm. Very comfy. The bathroom was modern and clean. The only disappointing thing was the TV in the room was beside the bed - not at the end so it made watching TV challenging. Also, we thought the waterfront was a little closer. Turns out its a downhill hike under a freeway before you reach the piers. There's a great little breakfast place in the courtyard to try. If you want to stay near the waterfront, eat solid seafood nearby, visit the Pike Place Market and downtown for shopping - this is just fine. Pretty expensive place to stay - but cool.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8101339">Spent two nights with my wife over the 4th. We had a bay view room that was more than we could have hoped for. Great view of the fireworks. This is a world unto itself after walking all day in Seattle. A great place to come back to. Pikes Place market is at your door step so the location is perfect. Try to stay as high ( as in floor height) as you can as the market opens early and there can be some noise. The beds are the posturepedic foam and are everything that they claim. We slept really well. I think if we ever go back to Seattle, this was our second time, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Room service was right on time and all food we had in the room, and in the restaurants, was quite good.One other thing about the view, you have Mt.

The lobby is modest but comfortable - you'll note that there are no pictures of the lobby on the website, because it's not much of a selling point. The courtyard, however, was quaint and quite pleasant. The fountain is relaxing, and the brick facade with the hanging ivy is a beautiful entry. I had a courtyard view room at the 4th floor, which has no view of Elliot Bay. I think you need to be at the 6th or higher for a bay view. The room was enormous and comfortable, and the bathroom is spacious. The ceilings were high, as expected of an older building. The bed was a king size Tempurpedic, as advertised. If you've never slept in a Tempurpedic, I must say that it is similar to an Asian hotel experience - the bed seems very hard at first, but gradually (slowly) forms to your shape, for a rested sleep - it just doesn't seem like it at first! The restaurant, Campagne, is an excellent (though smallish) French style restaurant, with a good wine selection, particularly the dessert wines (if there's any remaining, try the Cuvee Boytrytis-amazing!). Room service is offered from here, and I can only assume the experience will be as nice. There is a small coffee shop with morning bakery, and that was a delight first thing in the morning. The morning paper was at the door, and although the offerings included the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, I opted for the local paper. In-room wireless internet was complimentary, and signal strength in the room was fine. The location is simply wonderful, literally across the street from Post Alley and well-known pub Kell's, and (in my opinion) a better, local favorite White Horse Pub - DO stop in and give this gem a try! As you can see from the pictures, the Public Market is at your doorstep, and the rooftop terrace has a spectacular view (lacking in most of the rooms). I wish I had a full day to appreciate the rooftop deck, because it was delightful first thing in the morning (again, I refer to the pictures). The energy in the area is wonderful, and you are walking distance to much that Seattle offers. Again, the Market, the hill climb, the Aquarium, Ivar's (a must for Seattle), are all a few minutes of downhill stroll (long enough to enjoy a latte on the way!) All in all, The Inn at the Market is all about location, with a nice boutique feel. You can find something more comfortable, lower cost, better appointed, better restaurant, etc etc... but it is unlikely that you can find ALL these in one hotel for the price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6538904">My wife and I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed it thoroughly.

At the time it seemed charming, luxurious, well-managed, and well-positioned to walk the downtown area. When we returned in June, 2006, we found the property in exactly the same state, down to the carpets and the paint job, only five years older. Like the dowager in Dickens' Great Expectations, this old dame hadn't moved in five years (OK, Mrs. Havesham didn't move in 20), and no amount of air spray could cover up the decay. The area around the hotel has likewise declined, such that a stroll towards Pioneer Square had all the patina of a Fellini film, replete with panhandlers, stoners, bikers, and guys with pants well below their plumber's line for ease of repulsive viewing. Restaurants in Pioneer Square appeared dirty and the famed Skid Row area has returned as a flexible homeless folks' hangout. Too bad a city as wealthy as Seattle can't cope with the needs of its least able. While I see a potential synergy between quarters for the homeless and the rooms at the Inn, I suspect the $500/night rates might prove a bit daunting. I continue to give stars for friendly, professional service, regardless of a property's physical condition, and the employees at the Inn are thoroughly helpful. But they can't take the cigar smokers off their own balcony, nor the drunk, nocturnally screaming frat boys from the adjacent streets.

The hotel was very stylishly decorated, and the lobby area had just been redone (still smelled slightly of paint). Our room was unexpectedly large, and so was the bathroom. It seemed a bit of a waste of space to have such a large bathroom but only have a regular size tub with in-tub shower (and the shower head was not on a hose, which I missed). Still, it was trendily decorated in the Pottery Barn style, and clean and quite comfortable. Our room overlooked the harbor, which was great and made it a bit quieter. The amenities, comfort, style, and location made it a great place to explore Seattle from. The staff could use some work in terms of turning this into a top-notch service hotel. Two examples: 1) The first night we arrived late (10pm) and asked about places we could get a bite to eat. First, the (young) man behind the desk recommended their own restaurant for desserts. I then asked if there were any nearby tapas places (and I pronounced it in correct Spanish "tah-pahs" rather than "taa-paas"). He just stared at me for a moment, then said there were a couple of places just down the street. Turns out, he was directing me to two strip clubs (he thought I said "topless"). I am a 46 year old woman, and was with my husband. Seems pretty unlikely that I would be asking about topless bars, and he must have thought that or he wouldn't have stared so. Didn't it occur to him to ask me to repeat myself, or to look puzzled and ask me to describe the type of place I was looking for? Inexperience, I guess. After wandering up and down the street, and seeing The Lusty Lady and Showgirls, but no tapas restaurants, my husband and I did get a big laugh. 2) There is no place to park near the hotel--you have to use their valet parking, where you drop your car off right in front of the hotel. The second night we were there, the street in front of the hotel was closed and we couldn't get to the valet area. We drove around for 15 minutes, trying to find a different way in. We finally had to move some police barriers on another street and sneak in to get in front of the hotel. The desk was apologetic, but shrugged it off. And it must happen regularly--in the morning it was clear that the street was closed due to bigger happenings at the market on a Saturday. How difficult would it have been for the hotel to move its little valet parking sign and the valets and have the guests drop their cars off at the corner, 30 feet away? These are minor glitches, but for $300+ a night, you expect a hotel to work these sorts of kinks out of the system. Other than that, we had a nice time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124392872">Don't do what I did....stay here with my family because it was the best price I could find. At 2am, with other occupants of the hotel screaming, drunk and in a terrible fight, I would have paid the $50 more, or $100, to NOT have been there. We got little sleep and had to call front desk to come and handle the people fighting right outside our door. I didn't really care that much that the room was run down and dirty. It was exposing my kids to what felt like a truly unsafe situation that caused my regret. This hotel is definitely the home to drug deals, prostitution, and all night hollering and brawls. I've never written a review before but I feel strongly about trying to help you avoid what we went through. When we checked in, there was a very unhappy looking couple checking out. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never checked in. Just suck it up and stay at the Paramount.

Some homeless people in the region had more comfortable accomodations. July 4 weekend it was 109/night, we were desperate because most places sold out. Window was busted up and didn't close, fine for the temprature, realy bad for the nose, exhaust of cars out front and the constant fear of gun point robbery. The front desk staff and manager was AWFUL. Lied to us about rooms on phone, watched him lie to potential customers coming in.

As I was checking in, rats were climbing all over the counter squeaking for a refund. Ok, no real rats. Nor bugs that I noticed, but for the love of Seattle, this place was a DUMP. Where to beginâ€¦ the street level parking is awful. The underground was horrible as well. The room was the size of 3 closets put together. The one elevator with buttons from 1912 was scary. The staff was incredibly unhelpful. There was no breakfast. The bathroomâ€¦oh GODâ€¦ the bathroom was small, old, disgusting, dirty and full of hair and rust - no joke! There was no Kleenex in the place. The bed was hard and scary. Thank goodness there were three locks on the doors because the place didnâ€™t seem secure. Now, itâ€™s in a great neighborhood, and the views were very good of both downtown and the space needle. Itâ€™s on the Monorail, but be prepared to walk Â½ mile one way or another to board it. It has a â€œreasonableâ€� price. Butâ€¦what I had to experience there, was not worth $10. The ONE-WAY ramp into the underground parking was so narrow, Iâ€™m surprised a scooter could make it. And even then, youâ€™ll have to back up, move forward, back up a few times to get into a spot. Again, I liked the neighborhood and area, and the price was okay, but dear Lord, I worried about all the contents of my car the entire stay I had there â€“ I was moving to Seattle and had all my belongings in my vehicle. And equally, I could NOT stand the disgusting bathroom or the â€œfree Wi-Fiâ€� that only worked one of my two nights there. The only reason I didnâ€™t move out after 1 night, was because the price only matched hotels 20 miles away from downtown and thatâ€™s where I needed to stay. Please, PLEASE, do not stay here. If you care about your belongings, your sanity, your security, your cleanliness or your well being, you will avoid this place like the plague it is.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118566910">If I was bringing a hooker back to some seedy hotel, this is where I would go. The rooms are about 12'x12' and the bed squeaks every time you move. No water glasses, tin tiny soap bars, and a broken smoke detector, add to the ambience of this fine establishment. The bathroom is about the size of a closet. We found a smoked cigarette butt floating in the toilet, in our non-smoking room. Shows exactly how much the owners care about cleanliness. I ended up paying for parking, since the underground parking lot was full. This feat of manueverig only took 20 minutes of my time, since the idiot at the front desk obviously did not keep track of anything. The tv in the room got all 4 basic cable channels, so I guess thats a plus. Only stayed here because all other hotels were booked. How the owners get away with changing $100 is beyond me! The best part of staying here was getting out of the room. Avoid this dump at all costs, unless you have some kinky hooker fantasy going on, or want to experience how people in communist Europe used to live.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117907611">This motel is a motel, it served our needs, and I've stayed at worse places. We stayed for three nights in room 210 in early September. We had requested a room with two beds, and were pleasantly surprised that the two bedrooms were separated by a door. The hotel is nothing fancy. The bathroom, carpet, and sheets were clean. No bed bugs or other creepers. I read the reviews after my friend booked the place and every other place was twice as pricey or filled up, and was a little nervous. I prepared by buying earplugs and remembering to make sure that the door was locked every time we left. I ended up not having to use the earplugs, even though there was construction outside the back window. My worst fears weren't realized, and we both slept fine. It's perhaps not as quiet as the Westin next door, but it wasn't a problem. No parties kept us up, and nothing bad happened. The front desk kindly loaned us an iron and ironing board, and let us keep it in the room for our stay. He was also helpful with restaurant recommendations and getting a layout of the city. The location is great. Maybe other rooms are worse, or other people had different experiences. But the negative reviews seem overblown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117710399">The place is filthy, I'd expect to find a cleaner bathroom in a crackhouse!

The King's Inn is one of the only downtown hotels where I haven't been required to put a credit card on file. The pleasant fellow at the front desk did take a cash deposit for the old school metal room key he provided us. I asked about amenities and he mentioned a TV in each room. When I got to my windowless corner room I was appalled. The room was dingy, dirty and below the standard of all but the most flexible of travelers. The bed made us cringe, the door kept opening by itself and the portable space heater kept buzzing. The bathroom was very similar to the ones in an airplanes in size and the water pressure was awful. The linens were of the lowest imaginable thread count. It's really too bad, the place could be really cool if the owners spent a bit of money on it. Originally the Town Centre Motel, the hotel was considered the best located in the city in the 60s and features a cool mid century motor inn design. The location is pretty great... right under the monorail, close to the downtown/ retail core, Belltown and the Seattle Center. Unless you are stranded in downtown Seattle with no credit card I would not recommend staying here!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115023537">My brother, friend and I decided to take an overnight trip to Seattle.

We had a great time in the city until we returned to the hotel to find all of our stuff had been stolen. We immediately called the police and notified the front desk. The hotel did not even give us a free night at the hotel. Nor do they seem to care that if we were in the room we could have potentially been hurt or maybe killed.

This is a great place to stay if your into drug trafficing, prostitution, and hanging out with people who are high on who knows what!!!??? My girlfriends and I came to stay for the weekend and were mislead by the online ad for this Motel (which was advertised as a Hotel). As soon as we pulled in people on the lower levels shut out their lights and started peaking through the cracks of their curtains... Too high to realize that we could see them! We unloaded our things onto an elevator and were surrounded by about 5 men covered in pock and track marks! We witness two GI's (who happened to check in when we did) go to their rooms with two (i'm not kidding!) noticible transvestite prostitutes. We finally made it up to our room and realized that the door didn't lock! The front desk gave us a hard time about switching up to a room that did lock. We were on the 3rd level and as we looked down into the parking lot people were wondering from room to room. One room in particular had people roaming in and out, while friends waited in the parking lot. We had people knock on our room door asking us if we had a cigarette, matches, a lighter? We decited to leave to go get a drink (we had to be atleast a little tipsy to fall asleep in this hell hole!!!) We went to pull out and realized we were totally locked in! Not a security gate where we could use our room key to enter or exit... But seriously... a full on gate that was padlocked shut. The manager had to come out and unlock, open and lock it back up. We asked why we were locked in like that and they said to protect us from the people out there! We couldn't help but ask... What about the people in here????!!!!! This is the 1000% truth about our experience at this hotel. We only stayed one night and I am surprised we survived!!! (ha ha ha... we did hear one gang member looking guy mention that we looked like cops... We went with that!)

The room was cleant every day, TV worked, the bed was okay and I didn't have to share it with any bugs. Well, the doors indeed do not appear as secure but it's not good practice in any hotel to leave your valuables outside of a safe. If you're only at the motel for sleeping, it surely is sufficient - the location is excellent and there were no loud noises during my 1-week stay there. I guess it all also comes down to what people are accustomed to, but what do you expect from a 80$ per night motel right in the city centre? If people have stayed at the Marriot Seaside before (which one of the reviewers had), then of course it will be a disappointment to change to the Kings Inn. In summary, if you're looking for comfort and luxury, of course don't go here - in case you're looking for a cheap place right in the city, it's fine. And in case you need to escape, there is a great donut place right next door :-)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR83529369">The Kings Inn is an old motel in downtown Seattle within a few blocks of Pikes Place Market.

I found this one and booked it four nights without researching it. Out of curiosity, I looked at the reviews. I got into a panic! I changed my reservation to two nights because I did not want to lose money, but I was scared. I checked in with great trepidation. The office is totally ugly, like the elevator and stairs. But the attendant was cordial. Yeap, the elevator is filthy, so the stairs which stink even when they are open to the outside. I did not run into any questionable, drunk or frightening characters. Guests I came across were the typical tourist (some with family) who stay in very low budget motels and perhaps know what to expect. Thus, all rooms open to a corridor, and if you do not close the curtains, everyone will look into your room. Nothing new about that on motels. My room had been remodeled very recently: new carpet, painted, new bed. The bathroom had new linoleum, new sink, painted, new mirror. Good soap, shampoo and conditioner provided, but no cups. The door lock and dealt bolt worked fine. The room was designed for a single bed, but a queen bed was provided instead. This made the room very tight on space. So tight, there was only about 2 feet open space around the bed. But there were no bed bugs, the covers were warm, and the bed most comfortable. The place was quiet at night. I should say that I did not go out after dark to explore the place in the dark, my typical approach when I visit a new city for the first time. I let others do that and report. The wi-fi worked well all the time, on my Mac and iPod. I would had stayed the extra two days, since I felt comfortable at this place, but I had made reservations elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72475167">I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. The hotel has a great location within walking distance to everything. The outside is pretty old and rundown looking but they have free parking. We were lucky enough to get room 109 which is the only one in this hotel that has a kitchen in it. The rooms are 1980's and could really use a redo. The bathroom had no plugs so I had to do my hair in the kitchen. The hotel is right on an alley so it is loud if you sleep with the windows opened. I felt safe and if you get over the place being a little older you will enjoy your stay. Wasn't bad and wasn't great. The rooms are really small and we actually got some giggles on how run down the place was. If you are looking for a cheap place and want what you pay for this is it.

The price was reasonable and although small, the room was reasonably comfortable. It is a budget motel with the furnishings and bathroom reflecting this. We were out most of the time so it did not bother us too much. Our room was on the very top floor in the corner and did not appear to be very secure but we had no problems. The reception staff were not very friendly or helpful and the lift was disgusting with filthy carpet inside it. The room itself was clean enough but it is definitely not the kind of accommodation you want to spend the day in.

We arrived in Seattle on a Saturday afternoon and to our dismay, every single hotel in the downtown area was booked solid. We drove around for hours searching for somewhere to stay the night. At our last stop, Best Western, we were informed that there were no rooms available. The gentleman at the counter then suggested that we try the Kings Inn. It was already midnight by the time we arrived at the Kings Inn. I had my sister go and see if a room was available. She returned a couple of minutes later and told me that the Korean guy who ran the place had assured her that the rooms were very clean. She then made the colossal mistake of booking a room for the nightâ€¦â€¦ The nightmare began when I was cautiously approaching the room. Several â€œgangstersâ€� and prostitutes approached me and asked me if I wanted to go to a party in their room. They looked like they had been on a weeklong booze and drug binge! When I kindly told them no, they began calling me obscene names and flipping me off! Terrified, my family and I ran into the room and tried to close the door, only to discover that it would not shut properly and had no lock on it! We then began to examine the room and our hearts sank in unison. It was an absolute pigsty! It reeked to high heaven and strange formations of mold appeared to be growing on the ceiling. The beds were shoddy and dirty. The mattresses were sunken in the middle and there were bloodstains on the sheets. They smelled like an outhouse! We were horrified! We decided as a group to get a refund and to try to find a hotel outside of Seattle. When we asked the Korean man for a refund he rudely told us that too much time had passed and he was not going to give us our money back. He told us that the best he could do was to give us a new room. We had spent the last of our money on the room and the car was too small to sleep in, so we were forced to stay in that hell hole! When we arrived at the new room, the only thing that had changed was that the door actually had a lock on it. When I inspected the bathroom, I almost retched! The floor, tub, toilet, and sink had suspicious brown stains all over them and the mirror was broken. Later that night when I took off my shoes, I was disgusted when my feet began sticking to the carpet. The further I walked the stickier my feet became! When I sat down and looked at the bottom of my feet, they were completely covered in a revolting black substance! I decided to sleep with all my clothes on that night. It was around 2 am when someone began screaming outside of our room and began pounding on our door! They sounded like they were being murdered! We could hear loud rap music blasting throughout the night and people partying until 5 am! We all spent a sleepless night, too frozen in terror to sleep!

She told me that when they drove up to it, she thought they were stopping to look at the map and then would be on their way to their actual hotel. She called me and told me that she was staying in "a hole," and at first I ddin't beleive her. But when she told me all of the things she was experiencing: sticky carpets, slow wi-fi, smelly beds, loud traffic outside the window, "creepy" men staring at her and her friends from the third story balcony, outdated bathrooms and many other inconveniences, I agreed that she was staying in a hole. I checked on trip advisor and read the horrid reviews that other people had written. They were staying another night in Seattle, but she and many members of the group felt that it was unacceptable (and that's being nice about it) to stay here. The clerk at the desk the afternoon they arrived was very nice and did not give them any trouble. But the man in the morning was rude. One of the girls on the trip accidentally left a charger to her camera plugged into the wall and when they went back to the King's Inn to ask if anyone had seen it and brought it to the front desk, the clerk (the one who was rude earlier that day) said that he didn't know anything about it and that the maids would have been the ones to have it. But he didn't have a key to the maid's closet and couldn't get ahold of them on the phone to ask. They went back at the appropriate time that the maids were supposed to be there, but they found out that the clerk had told them wrong and that the maids came in the mornings. This place may have been cheap, but she said that she did not feel safe (because sometimes the doors did not lock), and she would have paid some of her own money (that was meant for shopping on the cruise) to stay somewhere else. The rooms could have been dirtier, I suppose, but my daughter told me that the sheets were scratchy and stained and the comforter smelled like something very unpleasant.

It is inexpensive for the location. Now the minuses: poor upkeep, everything looked used, dented, broken, smudged, or dirty. The room was very small, so small that one of ran into the table every time he got up in the night. And worst of all, the carpeting was sticky.

My vehicle broke down in the downtown area early January on my way back to Vancouver. The Kings seemed like a life saver at the time, as it was 11:30 Pm on a wednesday night. The rate, (about $90) although pricey, was still cheaper then a tow truck. Upon checking in, I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman of dark complexion who kindly showed me to my room and assisted me in finding a quality pizza service. It seemed that all would be well as I retired to my room to grab some some sleep. I believe I was afforded an hour of sleep before the Nightmare started. Sometime around 2:00 AM the screaming, door slamming and other intense activities began. It wasnt untill I went outside for a cigarette that I realized how badly law enforcment was needed. I was first approached on the balcony by an african fellow who wondered if I had " that Creme" for him. This was only the first of many attempts to lure me into a room by many of the motels occupants. There was obvious drug use of the Crack Cocaine variety present as well as prostitution , violence and drug trafficing from room to room. I believe i had been mistaken as someone else because all night there were phone calls being routed to my room and people banging on my door asking if " I had It" for them. What happend to decency and safe clean nights sleep? I'll be sure to steer clear off the downtown area from now on. Seattle is so wonderful during the day, but don't ever let yourself be caught there at night. Dont let the Kings Inn fool you, it seems alright, but unless you feel like gambling with your morality and your decency stay as far away as you can from this Dark Dirty Drug Den.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15906733">You can tell this place use to be a crash hotel by the looks. They have fixed it up, but it's still a dump; the sink and towel rack supported with 2x4's, cigarette burnt marks on the furniture and blanket, pervasive cigarette smell in the room, veneer chipping and falling off the furniture,etc. The worst part is the down and out is still crashing at the place.

I had no luck getting lodging nearby for the night and had a reservation here the following night. I decided to try this place. At 9:30 am, I was told I could check in now if I liked. My baggage was at the hotel I had stayed the night before. I was charged up front for two nights before even going to the room! I headed back to where I stayed the night before and checked on one more place (a nice major chain) they had a room for only $30 more. I returned to this place and told my change of plans. I was told I would not get a refund for the night as I had already checked in and it had been more than 30 mins. My reasons were: very small room, very outdated and worn furnishings, overwhelming smell of cleaning solution and portable space heaters! They would not listen and insisted I had checked in (I guess according to there computers). The offered me another room. When I went to that one, there was plaster chipping and falling off the wall at baseboard level. I decided it was not in my best interest to stay and they refunded the next night, which was $20 chaeper than the current night. The time lapsed from my charge and credit was 37mins/40 secs. I most likely spent 7 mins or so trying to get a refund and checking out the other disgusting room. The condition of this place should warrant $50 rooms. There are numerous affordable (some even cheaper)rooms nearby but they were not available. I guess this would explain why there were so many "Ready" rooms at 9:30 on a Saturday morning.

The room itself was small and sparce, but it was clean. It wasn't very noisy at all. When it comes to the shower, don't even mess around with the cold water, as I turned the hot water handle a full 360 degrees, the water was still, at best, tepid. Other than that, no real complaints.

We asked if we could view a room before making a decision. The Asian man behind the counter told us we could but we needed to give him a credit card to hold while we did. We came back disqusted and said we were surely not going to stay there. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. The outdoor elevator didn't seem as though it had the power to make it to the third floor (probably because there were a few hundred cigarettes on the floor of the elveator). The paint on the walls of the room was coming off in more than a few places. Over the phone they told us that parking was free. When we arrived they told us it was 15 dollars a night to park at the hotel. They advertised the room as a suite. Really, it had a bed, tiny bathroom, and a small beat up microwave was on the floor. When we arrived back at the counter to ask for our card back, he told us he thought we intended on staying and he said he already ran the credit card for a full weeks stay. We were furious and demanded he reverse the charges. He told us it was too late and that our conversation was upsetting possilbe customers so he called the police. When the police arrived, they were confused at why he was charging us. The asked him when it could be reversed and he said in the morning. The best thing he did all night was call the police on us because the police ended up being on our side completely. We still ended up being charged 5 percent of a weeks stay. ALL WE WANTED TO DO WAS LOOK INSIDE A ROOM BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF SLEEPING IN A DUMPSTER THAN PAYING TO DEAL WITH THE PLACE. I WISH I HAD READ THIS BEFORE GOING TO THIS PLACE. We ended up staying a couple blocks away at Summersfiled suites. I highly recommend Summerfields suites.

Let me first say that this is a budget hotel, so don't expect anything better than average. If it's comfort, convenience, etc. you want, you won't get it here. If, however, you're looking for a place to cover your head for the night, this isn't that bad of an option. We checked-in fairly quickly and took the stairs up to our room. We had two double beds and like any other budget hotel, you're first impression is "it's been used and abused." The good thing was that I didn't get that slimy feeling. The beds were okay, the pillows were skimpy, and the comforter was pilled. The washroom was okay. We had a courtyard view that provided an up-close view of the Needle. There is a decent size swimming pool indoors and a jacuzzi. I didn't use either but my buddies did try both. The jacuzzi kinda looked a little filthy to me but you can certainly smell the chlorine in the room, so maybe that'll ease your chill. The area is quiet and away from the city center (about a 30 minute walk). There are other budget hotels around the neighborhood. Next door is one of those local diners that serve excellent comfort food. We had breakfast there for a couple mornings and the wait staff were very friendly.

Booked this hotel, very near the convention site and very convenient to downtown Seattle for about a third of what the "convention rate" rooms were going for. After I booked the hotel, I read some of the reviews here and began to question my choice. True: my room was small - bed, TV, table, chair, two lamps, dresser, and bathroom (no alarm clock, fridge, or microwave) - but I was warm at night (despite the not-so-great heater), had hot water, reliable wake-up calls, and the room was clean. False: excessive noise, peeling paint, unfriendly staff. Realistic expectations are important: if you want a place with a great location on a limited budget, stay at King's Inn.

But the sheets are clean and changed daily. The noise that other people were talking about did not materilize beyond the normal street noise of a big city downtown.

The bath tub was mildewy, and rust stained, the light fixture was wired in with the wire running up the wall across the cieling, and over to the fixture. The light fixture was held together with Masking tape. The mirror in the bathroom was broken on the edges in several places, leaving sharp edges easy to cut yourself on. The tv was plugged in using a long, thin extension cord over to the other wall.

This definitely was low. Southwest Airlines recommended this motel and we made reservations for 3 nights. We drove in late from Vancouver (1:30 a.m.) and boy were we surprised. There is a sliding barrier gate that is locked after a certain hour to keep out non-guests. They needed it as two guys off the very noisy entrance street tried to get in "to visit a friend" when we checked in. When they were made to leave they were shouting discrimination because we were getting in. People were wandering around the hotel all night making lots of noise. The room was musty and needed renovation. Remote control missing from it's anchored spot on the nightstand. At 3 a.m. husband had had enough of the noise and wanted to leave but we stuck it out til daylight and checked out. Sleeping arrangements have made a huge leap in our priorities.

So we paid a whopping $80.00 u.s. to stay in this god forsaken place. It smelled bad, the T.V. barely worked, the wallpaper was falling off the wall and patched elsewhere, the mattress was old and sagging (very sore backs in the morning), the toilet wouldn't flush unless we played with the handle for a while and the in wall heater under the window was broken so we had a floor heater sitting on the floor in this already very tiny room. A few doors down from us was a group of young men who were there explicitly for partying. They were yelling, running back and forth (by our room), thowing plastic ice buckets and hanging off the banisters, on and off, throughout the night. I did not sleep.

Bathroom was small but clean and complimentary soap and towels as well as a shower. As with some other reviews, it is a bit noisy with the traffic and el-train going by but was tolerable since we were close to many of the downtown things we were wanting to go to.

It's not your typical hotel so if you aren't flexible and open to new things you'll have a bad experience. Don't go! The continental breakfast was simple but fun. Fresh waffles, good Stumptown coffee, and clean. We were upgraded to room with its own washroom at no extra charge because I mentioned it was my wife's birthday.

Though it doesn't always succeed or grow on a smooth path, it is awesome to watch a concept transform and breed new iterations of the original. That's how I would frame the Ace Hotel phenomena that's swept from west to east. I'm very familiar with the New York offspring of this Seattle original. Very cool, celeb chef in their restaurant, lounge for a lobby and some serious partners names partnered up: Stumptown Coffee in the front, Opening Ceremony in the back and more I'm sure to come. All that swagger grew out of an original hotel in Seattle. One which still offers excellent pricing for both European-style rooms (ahem, bathroom outside of the room) and Deluxe suites ($199 and worth every penny). The staff is friendly and accommodating; though please remember that the front door locks at midnight so grab that key before hitting the town! The modern design and simple but ultra cool decor feels opulent in comparison to your run of the mill big box hotels. WiFi is free to use and besides your room, you can choose to work in the front shared area with the terrarium or event downstairs in the dining area. Oh yea, in addition to WiFi and super sweet rooms, they offer a continental breakfast that includes a waffle maker and Stumptown Coffee. And a copy of the New York Times. Location-wise, it's just outside of the touristy area so Pike Place Market is only a 15 minute stroll away and the streets are very walkable.

The location in Belltown is excellent and in easy walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops and Pike Place Market. Staff were really friendly and helpful and seemed keen to chat and offer advice. The self-serve continental breakfast was good (I particularly liked the make-your-own waffles) and the lack-of ensuite bathroom wasn't an issue due to the sheer number of shared bathrooms. One downside for us was that our room was right above The Cyclops Bar and therefore pretty noisy. We'd been in the bar earlier (excellent burgers and cocktails - I recommend the Pink Eye) but the music seemed to go on pretty late and we didn't get an amazing nights sleep. But I imagine our room was the noisiest as we were right above it and we didn't ask to move, so can't complain too much.

We really liked the simplicity of the hotel, both in terms of decor and set up (the staff leave you yo your own devices unless you ask for something). The location was good to, about halfway between Pike Place and the Space Needle. We were initially unsure about sharing a bathroom with the other guests, but it was fine. I figured that people pay hundreds of pounds to stay at spa hotels and wander round in their robes, and this was no different! The bathrooms were all spotlessly clean, and there was always one free. The staff on reception were always friendly and helpful, making fab recommendations for eating/drinking. We would never have found Bathtub Gin without them! But I have to turn to the downsides. Our first night there was a Saturday, and it was pretty noisy from the bar downstairs until about 0230. We were also in the middle of a random heatwave, and with no air con in the room, just a desk fan, it was HOT! I am keen on a cold room, so others may not have had as much of an issue as me. It's true there was no wardrobe, but we were living out of out cases anyway, so we weren't worried about that. I guess the othernthing would be the size of the room, about the size of a double (not the master) bedroom in a modern house in the UK. We thought it was OK, but probably smaller than most would expect, especially in the US.

They also seem to have cornered the market on hip front desk people with an ear to the ground on what's happening in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117787738">We stayed for 2 nights last week, reception staff were friendly, helped us up and down the stairs with our bags (there is no lift, so pack light!) Parking is expensive, we found the best deal to be the hotels, though they did have free parking outside on the street from 8pm - 8am. Breakfast is great, toast, waffles, cereal, yoghurts and fruit. They didnt have any english breakfast tea which is a really minor complaint almost not worth mentioning, but would have been nice. Not everyone likes spice chai or earl gray :) The room was basic, but good for the price. It was a bit noisy over the bar and I havent slept in a single bed for a long, long time! Ipod docks and free internet a bonus. Bathrooms were always available and clean, and they give you nice robes. Sharing was not a problem, never had to wait. So for the price, it was a really good stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117571163">Excellent hotel. It may only be rated 2 star but it provided us with excellent service from friendly staff in a relaxed atmosphere. Who could ask for more? Any concerns we had about the shared facilities were quickly dispelled and it was actually a positive thing not having the loo, shower etc en suite. Recommend this hotel to travellers looking to engage with Seattle life.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117252113">This place is well run and well maintained. The staff is excedingly friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine, nothing special, though the coffee was better than your average hotel coffee. Location is excellent, and close to two great restaurants -- Local360, and Nora or Zola or something like that. Also a very fine coffee shop/bakery right across the street. Rooms are small, clean and efficient. The shared baths are kept very clean, and the hotel provides nice fluffy robes for guests. Clientele is not all hip and beautiful -- we're in our 60s! Even if their website shows no vacancies, it's worth a phone call because they don't put all their rooms up online.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116913382">I stayed here for less than 12 hours (late check-in and early flight) with my boyfriend. We both really liked it. I had stayed at the Ace in Portland and been to the one in NYC. This is worlds apart, there's no hip bar or coffee place or really much of a lobby. The rooms were just right, nothing unnecessary, comfy beds, friendly staff. The neighborhood had some bums loitering around, but it wasn't super sketchy. I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116526105">Well I've never written a review and had to for this place. What a cool establishment.

I called this place last minute and got the last available standard room. We were very impressed upon entering the unassuming entrance to the hotel. A stairway up to the front desk lead us to a beautiful lobby with giant ceiling. Very modern feeling inside. We ended up paying about $100 for one night. The room had a single full sized bed (sufficient for my gf and I), a table and a sink with toiletries supplied, also two white robes. The bathrooms were down the hall as well as the showers which are shared between patrons. Very clean and private. The location is great. It sits above the cyclops bar which has some great food. I recommend the fish tacos! Lots of great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. Overall a great experience here. Friendly staff and free waffles in the morning!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115930884">We were so looking forward to staying here. We'd heard so much about the Ace Hotels. The room rate was more than Hotel Moneco and I felt like I was a backpacker. The room was tiny, the person at the front desk couldn't recommend a good bar and there was no place to park our car. I appreciate the concept but it really wasn't valuable either through financial benefit or "funkiness". Wouldn't stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115791884">very nice but accessible only up steep flight of steps so not handicapped accessible<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115232722">We stayed two nights at the Ace Hotel in a double room with a shared bathroom. The hotel itself is really good, trendy interior and felt well maintained and clean. After advice from a friend who said the rooms at the front were really noisy from the bar downstairs, at booking I specifically requested rooms at the back. So I was disappointed to arrive and find we were just a couple of rooms back, at the side, still above the bar. The music from the bar did disturb our sleep the first night, but after finding the the earplugs supplied in the room for the second night, it wasn't as much of an issue. The bar closed at 2am and after that it was fairly quiet. I would still recommend this hotel, as the rooms are comfortable with nice touches (bathrobe, brita water filter), and the shared bathrooms were numerous and kept clean. The included breakfast is also worth having (the self serve waffles are good fun).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114870661">We stayed at the Ace Hotel for the last leg of our Pacific Northwest trip, and seriously considered extending our flight just to we could stay another night. If only there were more hotels like this.... okay, maybe hotel isn't the right word for it. Adult Playground Hostel might be more like it. Ace Hotel is in a perfect location, on a quiet strip of 1st avenue but less than a 10 minute walk from the Pike Place Market and downtown. The rooms look like they are out of a CB2 catalog, and despite the tight fit, they are actually decorated quite nicely &amp; with a trendy flair. There is breakfast served every day until NOON (awesome), and the employees are very friendly. Don't be discouraged by the shared bathrooms and showers. Although a 1 second walk outside of your room is required, the bathrooms are still very private and, if anything, cleaner than many of the real hotels I've stayed at. Long story short, stay here. You won't regret it -- and neither will your wallet.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR113562518">We spent the weekend at ACE and it was a positive stay overall but go in with your eyes open because it wont be to everyone's taste. The older building is renovated and has a friendly staff with a great location close to all the major attractions. Rooms are small and clean, Our room had a large 6 foot high orange and red Obey Andre the giant art mural covering an entire wall that dominated everything. Our corner room bordered two busy streets and was above a bar so lots of noise pretty much all night. I would request a back or interior room with less noise next time. The rooms have only a small metal sink and shared bathrooms. I was OK with the bathrooms but my boyfriend felt they lacked privacy and made the whole thing feel like a youth hostel or dorm.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113503965">The Ace is a good bet for your money, if you're traveling on a budget. We got the standard room with the shared bath; the room was small but clean and the bed was comfy. Our room was facing the outer wall which is right above a lively street with lots of activity well past 3 am, but luckily we had ear plugs. The shared bathroom situation is fine; there was never a wait for one to open up and they do lock, so you have it to yourself once inside. The best thing about this Ace was the included continental breakfast: make-your-own-waffle station, fresh juice, Stumptown coffee (in to go cups!), bread and a toaster, granola, yogurt and fruit. It had everything I would want.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR98007728">I had been to the ACE hotel in NYC (not to stay, to eat &amp; drink) and liked the style and vibe there. After looking at the Seattle web-site, I decided to book an overnight from Victoria, B.C. on a sea plane.Turned out upon arrival I had booked the wrong night, but they still had a room availible. Lucky it wasn't summer! Its a two story walk-up so there are no high floors or views, but when I travel, I just want a safe &amp; clean place to sleep, shower and store my belongings. The ACE in Seattle fulfilled my requirements. I was also fortunate to check in/out with Ed. He was very polite, professional, and personable. He gladly answered all my questions and gave me some tips and suggestions for places to go and see. The hotel is located in the "Belltown" neighbourhood and there are loads of bars &amp; restaurants within walking distance. I walked from Lake Union (float plane terminal) to the hotel then from there to PIKES PLACE Mrkt, the waterfront wharf district, through downtown, Pioneer Square, the football stadium, and then all the way back across d-town to the Spcae Needle in one afternoon/evening. At night I walked to a cool bar that Ed recomended. Its a secret Seattle location that only a local would know. From there the bartender sent me to the SPUR Restaurant where I had to try and not order everything off the menu. After 5 courses, incl. dessert, I walked it off. The area is safe but you need to keep your wits about you. There seemed to be alot of vagrants around so I just keeped on moving. I would definitley recomend the ACE Seattle to friends in my age range (20's to late 30's), but it's not for eveyone. As one of the reviews stated, the ACE Seattle is a cool adult hostel. But a really cool,hip, claen, and safe adult hostel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR90631720">We stayed at the Ace hotels in Portland, New York and Seattle on our most recent trip to the states and while we loved them all, the Seattle Ace was definitely not in the same league as the others (although it was also a lot cheaper). It was more like a trendy hostel than a hotel. That said, the staff were incredible, our room was cute (but very small), and the small touches (like stumptown coffee in the breakfast room) made it a great experience. Everything was clean and super safe and while the belltown area felt a little sketchy at times, it was close to plenty of great music venues and restaurants, and a short trip from capitol hill, which was definitely our favourite area. Even though Ace Seattle lacked the buzz of the New York and Portland Ace hotels, I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend to recommend this hotel to young singles or couples for short stays in Seattle<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR84556179">Friendly helpful staff and location was the best part of this budget hotel with sub-IKEA furnishings, paper thin walls and the loudest hotel entryway ever experienced. A pleasant accommodation where you will not sleep before 2am waiting for the constant wave of the inebriated loud and festive trudging up the wooden stairs right outside the front rooms to cease and the relentless dance music underneath to end. More hostel crash pad than hip hotel. Can't recommend or return until somethings done about the noise.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81395044">My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Ace hotel for 2 nights while vacationing in Seattle. I was initially afraid of the shared bathroom concept, but the perfect reviews from everyone proved to be true and I'm glad I listened. There was never anyone in the hallways or in the spotless bathrooms. If you understand and appreciate good, modern design, this hotel is for you. My boyfriend and I both even appreciated the music playing quietly in the bathrooms... our kind of music! The front desk was friendly and wouldn't let me carry my bags up the stairs. The waffles at breakfast are delicious and the whole hotel has a fun feel to it. We stayed in a plush, private hotel in Vancouver on the same trip and my boyfriend and I both prefered the fun vibe of the Ace to that hotel. The rooms have everything you need and deliver it to you in a quirky and unique way.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR75106050">Loved this place. Nothing I didn't need, but everything I did. Everything is spotlessly clean and comfortable; the folks at the front desk are young and very helpful; the included breakfast was delicious (granola, yogurt, hard-core coffee, etc). Only downside is that the area (1st and Wall) can be a little sketchy late at night; during the day and evening, it's fine. If you're looking for a cushy place with a lounge and and bar, this isn't it. Additional note - it's on a main bus line, taxis run by frequently, and it's walking distance to Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR74191360">It's not a boutique hotel at all, and it's not a Marriott or chain-like in any way. This will satisfy all of your hipster yearnings, from the modernist furnishings to the lack of elevators and boxed water. Good beds, sheets, pillows, towels, and a very happening neighborhood if you want to party with the twenty to thirty-somethings. Breakfast is in the basement and is self serve, including make your own waffle. The coffee is not strong enough, but it's all you can drink.

Not too bad for the cost.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR69150657">From the outside this hotel doesn't look like much, but everything inside was almost perfect. My GF and I were travelling with our two Chihuahuas and were reluctant to leave them in the room alone for a few hours. As it turned out, they were pretty well behaved, and didn't cause any problems. All the staff were very polite, considerate and understanding. The room we were in faced Wall St, so it was a little noisy at times. This didn't bother us much, but it may bother others as there is no A/C so you pretty well have to leave the windows open on a warm day. They do have a small fan to help with that as well. Rooms and (shared) bathrooms were very clean. As far as the location goes, it was very central. About a 6 min walk to the Space needle, and about 10 min walk to Pike Marketplace. Also, a lot of great restaurants and shops in the area too. The breakfast Ace provides was awesome! You can make your own waffles, or if you prefer, there is yogurt and granola, milk and OJ, and coffee. Overall, I'd rate this hotel a 5/5.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR60475665">My wife &amp; I spent an evening recently at this hotel. The Belltown location affords you the opportunity to visit Pike Place, the waterfront district, numerous top-notch restaurants, and lots of shops. The austere decor, limited room furnishings, and cozy room measurements might be a potential put-off, but the helpful staff, great location, can't go wrong room pricing, and full Continental breakfast might win you over; it did us! Worth a try next time you visit Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR51674939">I chose this hotel because it was located in the center of our weekend activities and was a reasonable rate. I thought perhaps that we might not be hip enough to be comfortable there but I figured it was only one night so we could just try it out. I was wrong - we loved it! - comfortable bed (hard to find in a hotel!), very nice staff and cool eclectic style. We did discover that while I apparently could sleep in the city my husband could not but since I had read all the reviews I could find we had armed ourselves with earplugs - but the hotel was honest enough about its locale that they furnished these anyway. He used them but I did not. There are plenty of places to eat within 2 or 3 blocks and you aren't far removed from downtown. This was just a one night getaway as we don't live more then an hour from Seattle but we will definitely be going back the next time we are going to the big city!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR49058936">What an awesome hotel...Comfortable beds, very clean, and fun artwork and decor.

I travel often for business and was sick of the Sheraton and Marriott so I decided to try something that was a bit younger and unique. While it is not the Ritz, it is clean, the staff are WONDERFUL, and it is within walking distance of many awesome bars / clubs. Don't expect a lot of amenities - this is a very minimalistic hotel - you get the bare necessities. I would opt for the deluxe room as it has a bathroom, otherwise, it gets the hostel / college dorm vibe in a standard room. The only real downside was that the walls are paper thin, so don't do or say anything you wouldn't want your neighbors hearing!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR39582565">A great little hotel. Perfectly located and easy walking distance from everything you'd want to do centrally. Also a very short walk to the ferry terminal to catch the boat across to Vancouver Island.

We stayed a night either side of Victoria - one night in a pretty small room with separate bathrooms and another night with an ensuite - both nights were great and all bathrooms, whether attached to the rooms or not, were ideal. We'd recommend this hotel for any length of stay in Seattle but it is ideal for a quick pit stop!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR38180759">This is a great hotel for the price. We stayed in a deluxe room for $165/night which had a queen bed, shower and toilet. The room had one unusual feature - the shower was separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. If you don't want to know your traveling companion that intimately I suggest you ask in advance about the shower design in your room. I gather from the posted pictures that not all rooms share the same design. Things that I particularly loved: self serve breakfast available until noon, coffee and tea avaiable all day, washer/dryer next to the kitchen, and location in a trendy and centrally located neighborhood.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR36167503">I booked a room here for very cheap for me and my friend to stay in.

We booked on expedia for a good rate (for the area) of $99 per night for a room with a double bed. The location was good for our purposes. Just a 10 minute walk from the Victoria Clipper dock and cruise ship terminal and a 15 minute walk from Pike Place Market. The neighborhood (Belltown)was kind of cool with a lot of restaurants and night life. The check in/out procedures were really easy and the hotel staff was very pleasant. The rooms were clean, minimalist, with a bed, sink, Ipod/music player and flat screen TV. There was no air conditioning, but the windows opened, so the room cooled down pretty well. Our room was on the street side. If you do not like street noise, ask for a room in a different part of the hotel. The rooms did not have a toilet or bathing facilities. There were five bathrooms, four with shower facilities down the hallway (for about a total of 30 rooms). They seemed to be cleaned pretty well, although I am sure not perfectly. Although the hotel seemed pretty full, we never had an issue finding one of the bathrooms or showers to use. Not ideal for many people and if we were staying for more than a couple of nights, this would have been an issue. They offer a breakfast in a room at the back of the hotel, downstairs a couple of floors, but we found a small bakery across the street which was pretty good, so we cannot comment on the breakfast. Overall, I could recommend this hotel if you don't mind sharing the bathroom. Otherwise, this is a good place to stay for a couple of nights if you can handle to shared facilities... if not, don't stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR28882890">If youâ€™re looking for something a little different than the cookie-cutter type hotel rooms that could be in any chain anywhere in the world, try this. Great minimalist-style while at the same time managing to be cozy. Beds were very comfortable and everything was scrupulously clean. If youâ€™re turned off by the comparison to a hostel - don't be. It was nothing like any hostel we've ever been too. Itâ€™s more like house sitting in your hip buddiesâ€™ loft. Great eating and drinking establishments within walking distance.

It's sort of no-frills, but if you're fine with that, this is a great place to stay. The design and decor is modern but not in a pretentious way, the room is rather large for a city and fairly well-appointed, and the staff was friendly and helpful. For the price ($99/night), in a city, you can't beat it. We were in one of the rooms that had a common bathroom. If you're worried about that, don't be: there was always at least one free bathroom, and every bathroom was always clean. The one downside: The pillows weren't so great. If you can, bring your own - or maybe find a store and go buy one, especially if you'll be there for more than one night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24966732">We went to Seattle for four days on vacation and chose the Ace due to its close proximity to restaurants and downtown. It is 'hip' and 'stylish' and there are Eames chairs in the lobby and that's all good, but ultimately what you have is a hostel converted into a hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. The beds are fine, and the aesthetic is right, but you really do get the feeling that everything was chosen so it would look good in a picture, not in real life. The quality of the materials (aside from the common-area furniture, which was all great) is quite poor, and looks like it all came from the As-Is section at IKEA. Other reviews indicate the night desk attendant is pompous and talks on the phone a lot- if you think this, you have to be completely wrong, because she was one of the most helpful people I've ever encountered in a hotel. 'Belltown' is sort of trendy, and the restaurants within two or three blocks of the hotel were incredible (i.e. the location if you don't have a car and want to walk is great), but I've never been panhandled so many times in my life (and I work in homelessness outreach) as I was within a block of this hotel. In the middle of the night EVERY night, there were fights and shouting and sirens, which woke us up constantly. If you're looking for a hostel, stay in a hostel. If you're looking for a hotel, stay in a hotel. If you're looking for an experience, and a bit of an adventure in being sleepless in... ah, forget that... (with excellent breakfast in the morning, I will say), try this.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23122547">What can I say bad? Nothing.

I wanted to stay somewhere that wasn't a typical hotel, which is what I got with the Ace. I first wanted to book at this hotel because of the one in Portland, which I heard was stylish, unique, and the place to stay for twentysomethings. Second, upon seeing the website and learning that you shared a bathroom with the other guests if you have a standard room, I was in (because hey, I wanted a different hotel experience). Once my boyfriend and I arrived in the city (around 10 AM), we simply parked by the Ace and asked them where their paid parking was. The receptionist was incredibly helpful and told us we could check in early and take advantage of the parking lot right then (which was a huge relief since I hate dealing with parking). With the room, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which irritated my boyfriend a bit. I thought the room was cute and since we were simply there to sleep, I had no problem with it. The bed was comfy and I found the bathrooms to be incredibly clean. As for the breakfast, I loved that it went until noon (because that meant my boyfriend and I could eat a little something upon checking in). I have to give another shout out to the receptionists because they were extremely helpful with directions. The one thing that got a bit on my nerves was the noise, which kept me up that night. At the same time, what can I expect when the hotel is located in a prime location and right alongside the main street? All in all, if you like a different hotel experience that somewhat resembles a dorm, then give the Ace a shot.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21746467">This Hotel looks great online. Although the price is right, it doesn't make up for the cleanliness. The shared washrooms were dirty, and most all the architectural details were very worn.

I would not recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21287282">We arrived at 8pm, the deluxe room we were given was small with no windows but a nice inside patio which was small but was an extension of our room and was somewhere to sit. We were tired after a flight from London so we just crashed. The following morning the manager asked us if we liked our room, we said we missed a window so he switched our room to a corner room which was a great improvement. We liked it and wanted to stay an extra night but the room had been requested so we checked out and went to the Hyatt for one night. The staff were friendly and the corner room we had was just fine, a little on the small side but the bathroom was big. I loved the style of the place, the staff and the location but the size of the rooms were the only gripe. I would stay there again but only for one night, and only if the room we had was a corner room with windows.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21076424">My husband and I stayed at the Ace Hotel in Seattle for three nights and I was excited to book the room since the style of the hotel was far more up our alley than a floral B&amp;B or a Motel 6. We were happy with the first impressions. Our room was decent sized and bright on a corner with two windows (itâ€™s one pictured on their website) and with a Shepard Fairey wall. We asked the desk clerk about parking, since it does state on the website there is off street parking available. He wouldn't tell us anything more than â€œif you got street parking stay there until 8am when they start charging.â€� We couldn't get any lot info from him, so we drug our luggage to the room. Once we headed to bed things got worse. The bed size is not listed on the website and I assumed it would be queen. The beds are full sized which made sleeping comfortably a little difficult, but there wasn't much sleep happening in that room. The room was above a bar, with a loading/delivery zone on one corner and a bus stop on the other. The noise was staggering and continued all through the night and into the morning when we had to wake early to go feed the meter. Also the glowing light from the hall showing through the window above the door was annoying and I never saw it turned off. The next day we requested to move (and in fairness the rest of the staff we dealt with were very nice and accommodating) but we were unable to move until the following night because the hotel was full. On a plus side, the shared bathrooms were never an issue finding one free, and the breakfast did include coffee, tea, fresh waffles, toast, granola, juice, yogurt and apples. There are also piles of good magazines available for guests, and robes in the rooms to use. The second night I slept slightly better because I used earplugs (which I do not find an acceptable solution) and we did again have to wake early to deal with the car. The third night we were moved to a smaller interior room which was considerably quieter (we downed out the music we could still hear with the fan) and it was across the hall from the bathrooms. This room, without anything on the walls, definitely felt like a â€œniceâ€� dorm room. However we did sleep better. All in all I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling alone or with friends and do not plan on doing much sleeping, or perhaps you have loud roommates who come home drunk and play loud music all the time. The location is good for walking to attractions like the space needle and the market, and we did find a few good restaurants nearby. I just donâ€™t know if I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR21019355">This was 'hip'. The rooms were fun, minimalist (i.e. lacking wardrobes), and spacious enough with large windows (we could just see the water). Things that I did not realise 'hip' would include: 1. I did not realise that breakfast was included - fresh fruit and the waffle machine I love. 2. I was not expecting was that the staff would be so friendly and let us check in early with our ten tons of luggage and then leave it all day on the day we checked out so that we could continue to explore the city. Everyone was so nice. 3. The location too was fabulous - just at the edge of the free bus zone, and not far from the sculpture park, surrounded by fabulous restaurants. 4. Shared bathrooms, 5 on the one floor we stayed on so never an issue getting into one for a shower in the morning and the showers were massive - could not reach from one side to the other. Do be aware that there is no lift (that I could find) and that the reception is up a rather large wide flight of steps off the main street - but the desk staff do help, which is lovely.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20807360">My husband and I spent four pleasant nights at the Ace. My husband and I were checking out Seattle for our future move to the area. I was a little wary because of some of the previous reviews, but I was totally pleased with my stay. The rooms are sparse, but just fine. It is aesthetic over function. My husband said the bed was uncomfortable, but I thought it was comfy. The mattress had a thick pad on top. I liked the wool blankets. The shared bathrooms were very clean. No need to bring soap, shampoo, or conditioner: it's provided. Plus they pipe nice music in! For breakfast they have a great waffle maker, plus granola, yogurt, toast, juice, and good coffee. Overall it was quiet, clean, pleasant, and fun. Okay, yes, the hallway lights are on until midnight and do shine into the window above your door. Seems a little silly. They should dim them at 10ish. And the younger people at the desk are uber-hip and unfamiliar with the nuances of hospitality- but they are all friendly enough. The exception was Ed (the manager, perhaps?) who was awesome. I asked him a million questions and he gave me great advice. They ask you to put a door hanger out requesting housekeeping service (instead of just doing it unasked), even though there is nowhere to hang your wet towels in your room. None of these were reasons to not stay here. Overall, it was a great deal for a room smack in the middle of Belltown. It was better than I expected.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20138575">Super location, wonderful staff, loved the style of the place, even our 8 year old daughter loved it - and that was even before they brought in the new waffle maker. It's small and cozy feeling even though it's all white. Interesting place... we'd definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19780687">Have stayed at three different rooms here during 2 stays over the last year. Happy enough the first time to return for a second. The value is great if you can score a room with the view out to Elliot Bay. Just beautiful. You dont need any more than the minimal ACe white decor with a view like this. Also enjoyed room with large glass shower also (no view). On the last occasion, $160 is a bit much for a small room with no view or special shower features. On both visits, found staff very friendly and helpful. The location is central. Late nite pizza/beer joint across the street is key after a long night. Breakfast included adds to the pleasure.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19583100">Overview: This hotel is marketed as modern design at a good price. It's definitely one of the more affordable places to stay in the area and the location is great. As a young couple, we felt right at home. Pros: We enjoyed our stay, it met our needs with style and was a fun change from more conventional hotels. Our room was clean, compact and comfy. It wasn't a huge room, it's definitely a compact design with everything in its place but we didn't feel cramped. We got one of the rooms with a bath attached. You can see in the photo that it was an open shower design, sort of Japanese style. You might think water would get everywhere, but that wasn't a problem. The breakfast provided the next morning was perfect--granola, DIY waffles, coffee, juice and tea. It's also located centrally, we walked to the art museum and other attractions with ease from the hotel. Great bars and restaurants are also nearby. Cons: The only con was that parking wasn't directly adjacent to the hotel and that the parking didn't seem to be in the best location. Parking was available but the lot was a couple blocks away. I made sure to park my car under a bright light in the lot because there were a lot of random men lurking about at one end of the lot.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18413044">The Seattle Ace Hotel overtly, if not aggressively, markets itself as a "hip" hotel. So if the rather advanced average age of the guests or the number of families with small children running around the place might make you doubt whether the Ace could really be all that hip, the management prominently displays--in a glass case in a small elevatorless lobby at the top of a very looooooong staircase--several copies of the book, "Hip Hotels USA," wherein one presumes the Ace is favorably and fashionably reviewed. But would true hipness so obviously advertise its hipness? And was Seattle Grunge ever really hip? That last question about grunge refers not to the hip-in-its-day musical sound that grew and flourished in Seattle twenty years ago, but refers to the molds, mildews, fungi, and other sporelike or spineless organisms growing and flourishing just last week in the shower stall and on the bathroom floor of my supposedly "deluxe" room at the Ace. Yes, small rooms, sparse dilapidated furnishings, and almost-all-white interiors do perhaps appeal to a monkish sensibility. But if you need a closet to hang a few of your clothes-- Sorry, there's not one, and no chest of drawers either. You'll have to make do with one of the three hooks on the wall, because that's all you get. I guess the ascetic style, if style is the right word, might be sorta hip in this overly materialistic age (although the room rates at the Ace suggest that the facility's management is not itself overly concerned with excessive materialism). But the thing with the almost-all-white interiors is that they show every fingerprint on doorjambs, cabinets, and window blinds in startlingly black and grimy detail. As to the sparse furnishings, one wonders, Can cheapness be hip? If so, let me put the question more precisely. Is cheapness hip, when it finds expression as particle-board furniture with skin-thin plastic veneer peeling from every corner? Is cheapness hip when it takes the form of an ugly white vinyl window blind adorned with greasey black fingerprint stains all along its lower margin. The stark white vinyl roller blinds, failing badly as an element of interior decoration, at least have the virtue of being easy to clean. But perhaps too much hipness would be lost with the disappearance of a few black fingerprints. Surely hipness must be more easily distinguishable from flop-house-ness. Okay, the flophouse comparison is too harsh (but after another year or so of downhill slide, might not be too far off the mark). A fairer comparison is a typical college dorm room, which would probably be slightly filthier, but with furniture in better condition. So if you think a college dorm room would be a hip place for grownups to hang out, then you'll probably like the Ace. Really, that's it.--a dumpy college dorm room painted white--complete with crumbling particle board furniture--except I forgot to mention the bathroom in our "deluxe room" had a sink that looked a lot like the ones in train sleeper cars in Europe. Wow, how cool is that!?!? Not particularly convenient, as anyone who's ever used a sink in a train car can attest--but how totally cool! And not only did they put one of those sinks in the bathroom, they also put a second one in the bedroom area, too, right where you'd expect to find a nightstand. Since there was no nightstand, we used the sink as a nightstand. No closets, no drawers, no nightstand, but two cool sinks. How cool is that?!?! So when you are brushing your teeth in the morning at the Ace, standing there in front of one of those cool metal sinks almost just like the ones in a Wagon Lits Sleeper, it might make you feel almost like you might have some vague spiritual connection with some really hip place that some really hip train in Europe could take you to. I guess I'm too old to know for sure whether the Ace Hotel is hip or not hip, but I will say that the physical condition and look of the place--the dirty dumpy dorm room style--manifests nothing beyond an immature aesthetic sensibility and a poorly supervised housekeeping staff. My guess is that the Ace's claim to hipness, though perhaps true years ago, has devolved down to a hollow marketing theme--a marketing theme that also serves quite well to disguise and excuse an uninspiring cheapness, a disconcerting uncleanliness, and a run-of-the-mill laziness. Or maybe I'm just not hip. Aside from its deteriorating physical condition, the Ace has other deficiencies, of which the overly "casual" attitude of its staff of never-quite-grew-up-thirty-year-old teenagers is among the least serious. Much more disturbing: Almost two months before my stay at the Ace, I had reserved and paid in full, in advance, for a "deluxe room with king bed." Upon my arrival, my wife and I were sent to the small, dingy room described above. The bed would be king-sized only for a pygmy monarch--barely six feet long and four feet wide, which does not qualify even as queen-sized and is actually a bit smaller than an ordinary double bed. The staff placed us in this depressing room with its tiny bed without giving an explanation or apology, and apparently would have kept silent about the switch if I had not spoken up. When I told the clerk at the desk that there must be some mistake and that we wished to be moved to a "deluxe room with king bed" as described on my reservation receipt, he replied that I could not be moved to another room because the hotel was full. He suggested that the problem was the fault of hotels.com, through whom we booked and paid for the room, but when I called hotels.com customer service, they did not accept responsibility. (The fact is, I don't care whose fault it was; I know it wasn't my fault!) The Ace clerk offered that, since the rack rate for the room I had been given was $20 less than the discount rate that I had negotiated in advance for a "deluxe room with king bed," perhaps a small refund could be arranged. I explained that, even with a refund, I would not have freely chosen to stay in the room I had been given. I would not have freely chosen to have slept in that room at a rate of a half or a third of what they proposed to charge. Indeed, I would not have freely chosen to sleep in that room, much less to bathe in that bathroom, even for free. Eventually, I was promised a slightly larger refund, which I have since received from hotels.com. Yet even if they had let me have the room for free, I would have much preferred to pay more for a better room in different hotel. Unfortunately, with the "Bite of Seattle" in full swing only few blocks away, there was nothing readily available except at an airport hotel. My wife and I were on vacation celebrating a "big" wedding anniversary (I won't say which "big" anniversary because you might conclude that I'm too old to understand true hipness), so I did not want to upset things by wasting precious vacation time disputing with the hotel management or searching for other accommodations. So, under extreme protest, we took the refund, bought a bottle of mold and mildew remover to spray down the shower, and stayed our three nights at the Ace. But Never Again! I don't care how hip they want people to think they are. One last irony that might provide some contrast: It so happens that the weekend before our weekend at the Ace, my wife and I stayed at the Seattle Pan Pacific, which is just a few blocks east. The rates for the two hotels are essentially the same (the Pan Pacific was actually cheaper if you don't count the refund we eventually got at the Ace), but other than that, there is no comparison between the dumpy and worn-out Ace and the lovely and comfortable Pan Pacific, with its interestingly and artfully decorated rooms, done in a contemporary pan-asian style; with its true king or queen beds; with its sumptuous bathrooms with huge jacuzzi tubs and separate walk in showers; with its well-maintained furnishings; and with its professional, polite, solicitous, yet discreet staff. Instead of splitting our Seattle time between the two hotels, I do so wish that we had just stayed on at the Pan Pacific.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18082462">A very reasonably priced hotel in a great location in Seattle. We spent two nights here and found the room and staff to be great. The communal showers were immaculate and we never had to queue. The breakfast was also great.

First of all, I have stayed at MANY hotels. The Ace was by far the coolest. As soon as we arrived we were hauling our luggage up the stairs and Ed the manager wouldnt let us carry our bags any farther. He jumped right up and carried them the rest of the way for us! Our room wasnt ready when we got there (4 hours before check in) but our wait was only about 15 minutes. When we got into our room we were so excited..we had room 106. It was very chic/hip. Bright white walls and a stainless steel sink. A flat screen tv attached to the wall and a view to die for...perfect for people watching! The hotel is right across the street from the Belltown Market, a little convienience store, and Belltown Pizza. The Cyclops downstairs was great. My friend and I both suffer from insomnia, and while yes it was very noisy outside, it didnt phase us one bit. We joked that our bed must have had sleeping crack in it! We slept like babies! The people at the front desk were great...Ed actually told us the best ferry to ride and where to go(we went to Bainbridge Island on his recomendation and it was beautiful!) The bathrooms were clean..and having to leave the room to shower was not a problem, they offered shampoo,conditioner, and bodywash in the shower. Breakfast was great. Coffee was strong. You could generally never tell that anyone else was staying at the hotel unless you saw them in the hallway. The employees leave the hotel at midnight and your room key works as the front door key...not a problem what so ever. The mirror in our room had the phrase "you are beautiful" etched into it. The area was FANTASTIC! 2nd ave is a blast as far as the bar scene goes! I 100% loved the Ace and would most def go back. In fact, I would love to plan a trip to one of the other Ace destinations just to get to experience it all over again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17171427">Very hip, very contemporary......very noisy!

A pity because the location is spot on.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15124261">After arranging a much anticipated girl's weekend with a friend - and an escape from children...I was MORE than excited about sleeping through the night by myself. I may have children, but I still want to enjoy hip places and cool design etc...so, rather than stay at a boring run-of-the mill hotel - we opted for the Ace Hotel's digs. In order to ensure maximum uninterrupted sleep - we booked our own separate rooms. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were informed that the hotel was full and that there was a mix-up with our online reservation and that we only had one room with a small queen-sized bed (supposedly it was a deluxe room) in it. Normally I would "suck it up", and accept that this was just a simple mistake - but this time I was really annoyed. My irritation was partially attributed to the overall nonchalant attitude of the uber-cool reception person - who didn't really attempt to compensate us beyond a slightly lower rate for the room. In fact, as she checked for our reservation on her computer she printed a sheet off and refused to let us look at it when my friend asked if she could see it - wanting to cross-reference the information on the sheet against what we had written on our reservation. It was strange, so much so that it appeared as though the mistake had been made on their part - but they didn't want to admit to it, and were quick to blame the online booking system. There was almost an inference that somehow it was our fault for booking online. To add insult to injury, we were also told after shelling out a small fortune for parking at a lot across the street, that we could have had our parking at a reduced rate at another lot - not easily marked. Once in the room, we found it dingy and not as charming as the photos on their web-site would suggest. However, we did see a couple of other rooms when we were walking down the corridors, that looked a lot better than our room did. Anyway, aside from being a great location and decently priced - it was the overall experience that just wasn't impressive. A few days later I received an email from the hotel thanking me for staying with them etc..."we hope you enjoyed your stay with us...etc..." and I responded with an email outlining my frustrations with our accomodation. This is not like me - but this time around, I really needed to air my dissatisfaction. The hotel's manager replied with an apologetic email and offered a discount on a later night's stay - to be redeemed by May 1st, 2008. This seemed like a positive response to our negative experience and I planned to return to the hotel with my husband for a romantic get away. Well, the so-called compensatory offer was never acknowledged. In my multiple attempts to contact the manager with a specific date and weekend in my messages - NOTHING. He did not return my messages. So much for that! I don't know what happened, as there was no reply at all. I guess the hotel doesn't need my business! Anyway, perhaps my experience was an isolated case. In any event, I will not be planning another stay at the Ace any time soon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14909721">We stayed at the Ace Hotel three nights (a Thursday through Sunday).

All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Upon check-in, the friendly receptionist (whose name I forgot to ask...sorry!) gave us 4 fabulous food recommendations in the city, all of which we tried and loved. Being the foodies that we are, it's extemely important to us that we get good recommendations from the locals. The room was small, but totally adequate and the shared bathrooms and shower rooms were spotlessly clean. We enjoyed the simplicity of the hotel and the little extra touches, like the adjustable lighting, music in the bathrooms, and all the free, current magazines available in the lobby.

Then we were upgraded into another chic room that had a revolving bathroom door with a mirror on it. My husband thought it was the coolest thing and would like to build one in our house. The complimentary breakfast and the mint scented amenities were nice to have. The ambiance of the place was so warm and cozy. The manager gave us a list of great places to dine at and visit and we enjoyed them all!

The first couple times I stayed there (in 2001 and early 2002), the staff was really aloof and way too into the fact that they were working in a nicely designed, young, trendy hotel.

The staff was super helpful and the room was clean, fresh and comfortable. A bit self-consciously hip - eames shell chairs, kaws art, etc. - but I liked it (although I have to admit, I like the look of their Portland location a bit more). I stayed in one of the standard rooms on the front of the hotel with a shared bathroom down the hall. The shared bathrooms were clean and close to my room (and having a sink and vanity in your room helps tremendously), but I think if I came back, I'd spring for a room with a private bath. The weather was great while I was there, so I was neither hot nor cold in my room, but because I was facing the street, it did get a little noisy on Friday night. With your nightly rate, you get a free breakfast downstairs in their little cafe/lounge with yogurt, toast, tea, coffee, granola, juice and fruit. Everything was fresh and plentiful.

A unique, fun place!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8537070">My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend in a standard with shared bathrooms and actually found it quite suitable. The early complaints about the windows not having any privacy have been resolved; they've added shades to the windows. The weather was mild so we didn't get a chance to try out the heating, but the air conditioning works well. As far as the noise goes, we stayed in a room 114 and slept fine--but even if noise is a concern, they provide ear plugs for your convenience. The room does come with a Kama Sutra book and condoms, laid ever so complacently by the bed. The room came equipped with a sink, a mirror above it that tells you you're beautiful, a hand soap dispenser, a vanity bar area with a tall mirror, a small desk with a small TV and an alarm clock, 5 hangers, 2 of which were occupied with bath robes, and towels. There's also a very modest snack bar (basically snacks inside a drawer) that you could grab for a price. The bathrooms were clean and come with a heater. Music plays softly through the speakers in the bathroom too. We stayed across the hall from the bathrooms so that was quite convenient for us. The kitchen/lounge area has an HD TV, serves Teaosophy tea and coffee, has a vending machine with very interesting items in there (i.e. Korean Pocky, popcorn, a deck of cards, caffine gum, hangover drink mix, and the standard potato chip fare, just to name a few), a drink machine next to it that has Aranciata (but we have NO idea how the vending itself works! There are no coin slots or buttons ...), and of course ice. Continental breakfast was great--includes milk, soy milk, OJ, granola, toast, and fruit. Light, healthy but quality selection. The staff was very friendly and helpful; we'd asked so much of them (i.e. storing the salmon we'd bought in their fridge, holding our luggage while we went sightseeing on the last day, calling us a cab late at night ... and more!) and they were very willing to accommodate accordingly. Overall, our stay was pleasant. The only complaint I could muster up was that the room was stuffy when the AC wasn't turned on, but that's quite minor. Yes, the mattress isn't memory foam or soft for that matter, and yes the blankets are coarse and Army surplus blankets, but quite honestly, for a place considered a 2 star hotel and for a 99 dollar a night stay, I wasn't expecting down comforters and memory foam mattresses (and am glad they don't have it as I am allergic to down), and I don't think anyone else should either. I'd choose this over the shabby, impersonal one star motels any day. We definitely would consider this hotel the next time we visit.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8223927">We have just returned from rainy Seattle, staying at the Ace Hotel in the Belltown area of the city. My husband and I were among the oldest guests of the hotel, by several years, but we never felt uncomfortable or unwelcome. Justin was so helpful when I called BEFORE our stay, recommending Dollar rental cars as they not only give discounts to Ace guests but also waive the fee for returning the car to the airport instead of the pickup site. (Both John and Jessica at Dollar were extremely nice too!).This arrangement allowed us to travel down to family in Gig Harbor and then use the car to return to the airport the next day. Justin also informed us that we would most likely have to change rooms on the last night of our 3 night stay, due to a snafu with our hotel.com reservation. Once at the Ace, we were warmly welcomed by Jibriil who showed us our room on the lower level. I was a bit surprised as Hotels.com had "guaranteed" a king size bed and we had a double. I asked Jabriil about the mixup (never having booked through hotels.com before) and he explained that there must have been an overlap in the booking. The room and bed were comfortable and a decent size with a large clean bathroom. I'm not that high maintenance, but do like to read at night, but there was no reading lamp in the room, just overhead recessed lighting. Jabriil came to my rescue with a small reading lamp and extra pillows. All were clean-pillows obviously sprayed with lysol between uses-but no biggie. The only thing missing in that room was a place to hang clothes and a couple more hangers. On the last night we did indeed have to move to a smaller room. Same size bed, smaller bathroom-a bit noisier as it was next to the stairwell. Still, we were quite comfortable and slept well. So the plusses: Justin and Jibriil-definitely they are the nicest guys, unpretentious , friendly, helpful. The location in Belltown is in the heart of all the under 30 hipness, but we over 30's , un-inked, non-smokers did not feel too out of place! The minuses: booking through hotels.com (I'm not sure the price of the rooms through them were the same as if we had booked directly through the hotel) and having to switch rooms. We would stay here again, but next time book directly through the hotel and request the rooms with larger beds. Still, it truly is the people who make the difference.

It was a great hotel....there are a few steps up to the front desk but it's not that bad and when i left the guy on the desk offered to carry my suitcase. The staff were really friendly and helpful, happy to give directions. They even helped me unpick my suitcase lock when it broke and they printed up some stuff for me. I stayed in two different rooms while I was there as I had a few days at the hotel then went to university of washington then came back again. Both rooms were decorated differently. The beds were comfy in both rooms and there were lots of TV channels which is always good when u first arrive somewhere and just need an hour or so to relax! The wireless internet connection was good and fast. The showers and toilets were really clean and they provide shower gel and shampoo. Also get your own bathrobes, which was handy. If you wanted your room cleaned you had to put a thing on your door...I saw people complaining about this but you don't need clean towels every day! Breakfast is basic. Toast, jam, cereal, apples, yoghurt and then there's coffee, tea, orange juice and milk. I think the hotel is also pet friendly as I saw someone with a dog. There is a mini supermarket across the road and you are near everything like pike place market, capitol hill and downtown etc. This hotel really is in a great location. I'd heard some people complaining about noise from the cyclops club which is below it. I didn't get kept awake at night at all although my second room was not on 1st avenue and so was quieter than the first one. In any case i am sure you could request a room not on 1st avenue when you book. I would definitely come back here it's funky, clean and the staff are lovely!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8096256">The Ace is a very cool, centrally located hotel with an awesome staff. My wife and I stayed here in late June and early July and were definitely impressed. First, the location is awesome. It is located in the heart of Belltown, near great music clubs, Pike Place, downtown, and Capitol Hill. You couldn't ask for a better location, especially for those of us who like to walk and use public transportation. Note: the bus is free in the downtown area, only a couple blocks away. Also, the staff is great and provide a real local aspect to it all. We regularly asked questions on bus routes, good music venues, recommendations for local eateries, etc. We always got a very friendly response with good tips. The rooms are very clean, as are the bathrooms. All of this for less than a $100 bucks a night is a bargain. I definitely recommend the Ace for travelers who like a unique, cheap urban hotel with cool staff and design.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7849907">When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage. We got to the top, checked in and were placed in the room at the very end of the hall. The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet. We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold. The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room. We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1" tiles. I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room. He said I had to check with Hotels.com since I prepaid and booked through them. Fair enough. He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see. Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems. He didnt offer to have us check another room or to investigate our concerns with the original room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7544083">I stayed in a room with two queen beds and private bathrooms.

Free wireless internet and a CD player. Very large bathroom, kept clean. Laundry and self service breakfast with toast and cereal and coffee and fruit.

The hotel is decent, but more like a 2 star based on my experiences. Overall my experience has been just ok. The room is a "deluxe" room according to the hotel, which isn't very deluxe-it just means I get to avoid sharing a bathroom. So here's my summary: Pros: Location-Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Convinience store across the street. And an easy walk to downtown about 10 minutes. For those who don't want to walk, there's a bus stop right outside the hotel with frequent service. If you walk a block or two further closer to downtown, you'll be within the "free ride" zone to save yourself a 1.25/1.50 at rush hour. Wireless Intenet included The hotel is clean. Small continental breakfast included featuring toast, granola cereal and juice included in price. Cons: No elevator at the entry, so you have to climb a decent flight of stairs to the reception area. Not a big deal for the young, but could be a hassle if you've got heavy luggage. Receptionists seem friendly enough, but you can tell this is part-time work for them, and they don't seem to be all that interested in the comings and goings of people. I've walked past them numerous times at all hours of the night without so much as a look up to see who is coming into the hotel, or to give a simple greeting. Rooms are small, just enough for a bed, and a tiny desk and chair. And I'm in the "deluxe." Decor is trying to be boutique-y, but to me it just looks like a sanatorium. Walls in the hallways and rooms are all white. There is no closet or drawers to speak of, so your luggage and clothes are on the floor in an already small room. You do have metal hangars hanging from a coat hanger on the wall which you can hear clanking at night and in the morning from the adjacent room. Bathroom is ok size, but looks cheap, with only a stand-up shower and toilet with open u-faced seating like in an airport or store, which isn't a big deal except that the towel holder is placed right above it, and to get a folded, stacked, and jammed in there towel out, it's easy to pull out the rest of them which fall into the toilet--not real smart thinking Ace. Naked lightbulb serves as the lighting for the room, which adds to the hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect. And the clincher is tv on a wall arm extending from the ceiling. There's nothing like a tv attached to the wall/ceiling to give you that "motel" feeling. Also, you have to leave a "service room" tag on your door when you leave, or they will not do housekeeping. They try and sell it as "leaving you alone," but I think it's more about saving money. Summation: For location, and due to the few options available in this price range, this hotel is a decent option. But to call it a "boutique" hotel experience and charge a discounted corporate rate of 160 a night for a plain room that measures 15X15 in Seattle? That's definitely not aces.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5182600">Great hotel. The rooms are really fun - not huge but certainly different and comfortable. We stayed in a room with a shared bathroom but we never had to queue for one of them, even in the mornings - in fact, we could take our pick and they are palatious and clean. Don't worry about the noise either - our room was literally right over the Cyclops bar and if you have the window open it's noisy but as soon as you shut the window it's pretty quiet. Great location too - right in Belltown so loads of bars and restaurants nearby, 10 mins walk from the Space Needle and in the other direction, 10 minutes walk from downtown. Great value place to stay in Seattle, maybe not a place for the over 40s though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3285240">We made an internet reservation for a Friday, then rang an hour later to add Thursday to the booking.

Total apathy, not concerned at all. Says a few sorrys, looks at the reservation book, more sorrys, more apathy.

The Ace is a great concept, hipper than thou warholian installation a la auberge. Knowing that some rooms are better than others I reserved well in advance and requested one of the deluxe rooms in the back. When i arrived they'd given the room to someone else offering the excuse, "well, the previous guest decided to stay an extra day", and the front desk person was very rude and put out by the whole exchange. The room i ended up with was small dark and very noisy. It was impossible to sleep or enjoy staying in the room as you could hear everthing from the adjacent rooms. Nothing like listening to "Cops" blasting from the room next door at 1AM, or hearing your neighbors snoring, coughing, flushing their toilet, and wondering how much they could hear as well. Unless you're twenty something and planning on partying all night and coming home and passing out aka leading the psuedo rock star life style i suggest stearing clear.

After having wrestled with eight pieces of luggage for several days, they were dumbfounded to see that the hotel is a walkup. No problemo. A couple fellas got the luggage both in and out of the hotel in fine form. The only thing the ladies had to do with their pieces of luggage was sit on them in order to zip them back up.

My second and third visits proved to be frustrating, irritating and uncomfortable. The rooms have been small, dark, with hollow sheet rock walls seperating the rooms. You can hear everything .... EVERYTHING. The neighbors on one side left their tv on all night (it's probably still on), the ones on the other side came home around 2AM had loud sex and then spent the rest of the morning puking in the bathroom (another reason not to opt for a shared bath). There is no service except for there front desk where you'll find a terse urban hipster with multiple peircings reading a magazine and chatting on her cell phone who makes it known that you are a bother. The place has great possibities, unfortunately they are not realized. After 3 visits I give up.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR1757703">I stayed at The Ace for 5 days this March and really liked it. It was clean, very accessible to nearby restaurants (some pricey ones though so be aware), and had a nice staff. They were helpful in suggestions on where to eat and one nice woman helped my boyfriend and I down the stairs with our luggage which wasn't necessary but very nice of her. I really liked the decor of the room too. It was simple but perfect if you're used to non-fussy places. The shared bathrooms were clean and the maids cleaned the room up nicely every day. I didn't encounter any noise problems but that is because when I booked the room, I specifically asked for a quieter side that did not face the noisey street. It was quiet and pleasant and I'm a light sleeper. The Cyclops downstairs had good food and a fun atmostsphere. One drawback I would say is that it's hard to find an inexpensive place to get something to eat in the neighborhood. Also, going alone to the bathroom at night seemed a bit sketchy because the halls were very dimly lit to look cooler, I guess but I was a little paranoid of going to the shared bathrooms without my boyfriend in the middle of the night. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the place to anyone who wants a fun, no-frills place to stay that's convenient to everything.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR1559494">My friend booked this hotel so that we wouldn't have to drive or take a taxi for a weekend in Seattle.

My poor friend spent about 20 minutes drive around looking for parking while another friend tried to get the front desk clerk to tell her where we could park but he was too busy on a personal call to talk to her.

Where I spent most of my vacation<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR304233236">Beautiful two weeks in Paradise I just returned home from a relaxing two weeks in Paradise! The airport in Punta Cana is a wonderful, traditional open air airport. From the start you are put into the tropical mood by getting off the plane by walking down the steps onto the tarmac. The open air airport really gives you a feel of going back in time. Domincan clad ladies greet you and take a picture as you arrive which you can purchase on your departure for 8.00 US. We were then off to our van to be on our way to the resort, this drive was about 20 minutes or so. We were early but were given our room about an hour after we arrived so we went to have lunch at the El Behique beach buffett. Upon arrival the resort is breathtakingingly beautiful. After lunch we were assigned our rooms. Our freinds and us both got ground floor rooms which was dissapointing at first but we came to love not having to trek up the marble steps every day after a long day at the beach. They put us down the hall from each other which was very convienient. We had several issues with our room, it was musty and I always read this on your site and think the people are just being picky since it is a beach resort that you should expect it but this place really was musty. We found that our air conditioning did not cool to a proper tempurature and my Husband addressed this with the front desk 6 times and it was never resolved but we made do. We left our key card in the slot so that it would run all the time and it made it bearable. Our freinds room was fine and there air kept there room very cool. Our lighting was weird, you had to have the lights on at the sink to work the light in the bathroom area which was alright except for in the middle of the night when you would get up to go to the bathroom. Other than these issues everything was great and we could have changed rooms the next day but I did not want to bother with packing up everything again just to move. Our only negative issue was the food. We have been to many resorts all over the Carribean and this by far was the worst food I have ever had at any. I can not pin point if it was the style of the food or just the food itself. There were not many American's there. Most of the people were from Europe so maybe they were catering to the tastes of them but we really did not enjoy it at all. We basically only liked the Italian restaraunt, we went there 4 times and hit the pasta bar at the buffetts also. The guys would only eat pizza and french fries closer to the end of our two weeks because they had major bathroom issues. Nobody got actually sick in our party but it did go straight through so take your pepto and immodium. Breakfast was pretty good since you could get pancakes and waffles and french toast. We hated the coffee, it was way tooooo strong for us and like I said before this was just our preferance, the Europeans loved it. My freind and I took advantage of the spa on one day and were dissapointed, it was more like a gym inside a spa. You had to share the two large jacuzzies with other people although they will include them in your spa package like your getting a private jacuzzi soak and the massage was good but other than that it was not really worth taking time out of your vacation for it. I would opt for a massage on the beach instead of using the spa itself. Nobody speaks English at this resort so most of our issues may have spanned from not being able to get across what we needed or wanted but you really cannot complain about that since we were the minority and there are so many languges these people would have to learn to please everyone there. I would say the majority would be Spanish and French. There were some German but not many. All in all it was a nice stay, the jacuzzie's in the rooms were nice. The beach was just heavenly and this saved the whole vacation for us. We have never seen a more beautiful sky or beach or large palm trees. The grounds are gorgeous and everything is very pretty. The good thing is none of us gained any weight on our vacation so this actually worked in our favor. The sports bar is really nice and we also took the Saona Island tour which was awsome and we highly recommend it. Go and have a great time!!! Book the Suites though if you want more romance and quiet since it is an all adult beach/pool. Our pool bar was the best! It was well worth the upgrade.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR656911927">Had a wonderful time My husband and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana. We stayed at the Royal Suites portion of the Grand Palladium and were very pleased. Here are our thoughts....feel free to email if you have questions about any of the palladium sections. we did a lot of walking around and comparing. FYI-DON'T PUT ANYTHING EXPENSIVE IN YOUR CHECKED BAGGAGE - yes, it seems obvious but we did and unfortunately, by the time we made it back to texas, we realized our camcorder was stolen. the airline has been really nice working with us, but it still stinks.Biggest perks about royal suites compared to other parts of the grand palladium: no kids, guaranteed direct access to the beach/pool and view of the pool, free internet and premium liquor, access to royal gourmet restaurant...overall, generally less crowded with a more mature group of people staying thereBiggest negatives (compared to other parts of the Palladium): the location. most of the a la cartes and the theatres are in the bavaro section...all the way on the other side of the complex. though you could walk it, it might take a good 30 min or more to get over there. there is a tram that stops by the rooms, but it's often full and even then, it takes a long time to get to where you want to go. ______________________________________For those who want more specifics.....Beaches: Fabulous! Probably some of the best we've ever visited. Weather was great and the water was really clear. Yes, you have to play the 'towel game' and reserve a spot at the pool or the beach, but we never had a problem with this. There was always some place on the beach open (and there aren't really any bad spots) or at the pool. Food: we thought it was really good, but we also had realistic expectations. it's similar to what you would find on a cruise. We thought there were plenty of options, and for the most part, we could always find something we liked to eat. We ate at the Royal gourmet, japenese, spanish, and seafood places. They only one we would not give a positive review was the seafood. the service was lacking and slow, not enough menus, the food was way over salted, etc. Plus, even though the lobster was considered 'all-inclusive' at the royal gourmet, it was $33 here. Rooms: We were in the royal jr suite and felt it suited us perfectly. i don't have any complaints. The minifridge was restocked every day, the rooms cleaned every day, we were on the first floor with a balcony facing the pool, we had a jacuzzi tub, a sitting area, nice tv, safe, etc. Activities: we chose to mostly sit on the beach...beautiful and quiet. we went to the shows every night, and though often very cheesy (uh - can we say michael jackson show)...we were really entertained. we went to the spa one day. that was great and the staff was very professional. we went parasailing...way overpriced. wouldn't do it again. we paid $30 to take a boat taxi around the ship wreck, we thought that was pretty cool. we went deep sea fishing with mike's marina. though it was fun, turned out to just be an expensive boat ride because we didn't catch anything. One thing to note....the place shuts down pretty much around 11 unless you want to go to the disco (which was lacking).Tipping: couldn't quite figure this out. we tried to throw down a couple of bucks when we could (like at the restaurants, bars, and spa). It seemed like the only people that expected it were the people we were doing the 'activities' with (e.g. the parasailing and deep sea fishing).Hope this was helpful!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR105203552">Nothing "Royal" about it After reading many positive reviews for the Royal Suites, we were very excited to book our 7 night vacation. We were not impressed! The beaches in Punta Cana are about the best you will find! That is about the only positive I can say about this trip.This Grand Palladium complex is enormous, and is geared for a european crowd. At the gift shop/supermarket you cannot find a single publication in English. Not a newspaper, not a magazine! I would say there was approximately 95% German travelers. No more than 2% were english speaking. The food is, at best, mediocre. The one meal that was excellent was the grilled lobster Sunday evening in the Royal Gourmet. We also tried the Asian and Mexican. We did not enjoy either. Buffets were not very good either. Both variety and selection were lacking. The Royal Junior Suite we had was really nothing special. Room was kept acceptably clean. We tipped the maid several times throughout the week. Nothing special was noticed, not even a simple towel animal The bed was terrible, and the pillows worse! We had to ask three times over the course of a day for extra pillows before any were brought to the room. Furniture was old and in need of replacement. Mini-bar was serviced only after requesting at the front desk. It was then stocked with warm beverages. We had to then travel back to the lobby to find cold beverages, which we did for most of the week as the mini bar rarely had anything in it! We thought the way the toilet and shower were laid out was very odd. They were simply like two closets with glass swinging doors on them, with open space on top and bottom. The toilet provided little privacy. The pool area was very nice, but the pool was always in need of a cleaning, and was also in some disrepair. Wood foot bridges over the pool were in need of paint.Loungers were nearly impossible to be had in either the pool or beach areas unless you played the 'towel game'. Even then, we had loungers taken on two occasions when we had towels on them. We heard about a fight on the beach over this. Ridiculous!! We also found some of the loungers to be broken.We found the service to be hit or miss. Mostly miss! Along with the pillow and mini-bar issues mentioned earlier, restaurant service was no better. Table set-ups were many times missing silverware. Asking for coffee several times, being repeatedly told it was on the way, and then never getting it. Having to go to the bar to get your own drinks during dinner because your waiter never comes back to check on you. I could go on.Punta Cana has become an extremely popular vacation destination. The amount of people traveling there has increased greatly in the last few years. The Punta Cana Airport is already undersized, and very inefficient. Lines were incredibly long and disorganized, with no one to offer direction. Out of six or eight security stations available, two were open. They just haven't figured out how to deal with large crowds. I just can't understand how so many reviewers can say this is a great resort. Were we just there on a bad week? I don't think so.We have traveled extensively in the Riviera Maya of Mexico, as well as several other Caribbean destinations. There are much better resorts to be found.But, as they say-To each his own.This was our third trip to the DR. Once to Puerta Plata, twice to Punta Cana. It will be our last.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR885761571">Our 3rd time at Royal Suites We, this time a group of 6 people from Finland, just returned from our 5th trip to Punta Cana and 3rd stay at Grand Palladium Royal Suites, which is now called Royal Suites Turquesa under the new brand name Royal Suites by Palladium.Why somebody in general travels to the same resort another time or many times to Grand Palladium Resort Royal Suites???. In general I would say simply: when you take the same target another or more times, you know how to have your enjoyment there.In our case the answer to many times question is very easy, because we`ve been and seen to some other resorts also in Punta Cana Playa Bavaro area.1) Grand Palladium Resort is large enough for 1-2 weeks vacations (4 hotels, about 12 restaurants, lots of bars), works well and is a well-maintained nature beach paradise. 2) Royal Suites Turquesa is just for us: - peaceful relaxation, - good food and drinks, - spacious beautiful seaview rooms with jazucci in/outdoor, - own pool with swim-up bar (thanks to Danny, Santo) - personal contact with the kind personnel- good service with nice humor3) We especially liked the Royal Gourmet Restaurant, which was new to us. Thanks to Juan, Ana, and many others for taking care of our needs.4) Royal Suites Turquesa recepcion and lobby is a nice place for spending your leisure time with newpapers, internet access and good drinks. Thanks to Edward, Daniela, waiters and all others for good services. 5) Newly opened Renova Spa is just in front of Royal Suites. 6) One of the best things in my mind is that the hotel management is all the time doing a good job to keep the wheels rolling.7) Finally, as I have heard the resort is continuously developing for our next trip, and so we have started to plan our next trip to Royal Suites.Have a good vacation wherever you travel, but be aware where you are going to!Frequent travelers from FInland Europe<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR427879285">Nos defraud贸   showReview(20396762, 'full');<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126513761">Great rooms!

The Inn at Virginia Mason was built in the late 20's, and has been well restored and maintained. Carpet, furnishings and decor were good quality, in good condition and stylistically appropriate for the era. The bathroom was small but all the plumbing was modern and functional. The hot water room heating system was unusual: like a giant valence hung from the ceiling across the tops of the windows. It kept the room at a comfortable 72-76 deg F (no matter where the wall thermostat was set). The restaurant menu was small but the food and service excellent. The location is exceptionally convenient if you have business at Virgina Mason Clinic or Hospital. The Inn is connected to the clinic, so you can get to any department without going outside (or climbing any hills). It's about a 15-20 minute walk to downtown and Pike Place Market (double that back up the hill). Bus service on routes 10/12 will get you there quickly and cheaply. While you are at the Inn, cross the street to the Baroness Hotel and check out its beautiful Art Deco lobby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR65632960">While staying at this hotel, I had approximately 35 percocet stolen from my medicine bag. Since many people stay here to be with loved ones during recovery from surgery, I imagine the housekeeping staff are quite aware that narcotics can be in the rooms. In addition, the employee had to look through my bags to find the pills. If I had more time, I would have reported this to the hotel and filed a police report. However, I expected this would be a giant waste of time which I was short of. When I got home, I emailed the hotel and have yet to receive a response. If you must stay here or at the Baroness, I urge all to leave nothing of value in your rooms. Also, the associated parking (down a very steep hill and a block away) was extremely expensive.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR43978512">I needed to go to a conference and I was only staying in Seattle for less than 24 hours. I could not see me paying $200 a night at the hotel where the seminar was held. After reading the reviews, I pretty much knew what I was in for. When I stayed there was no loud construction, but it was a weekend. I did see patient across from me thru the window, but I'm in the medical field and that didn't bother me. I was over the hospital air conditioning unit which was bothersome. The air condition was not all that great but I did open the window for awhile. No hair dryer or coffee pot which is not all that of a big deal, however when you need to wake up at 5:30 I would of liked a little kick start. The location was great. I walked everywhere I needed to....definitely bring your tennis shoes . The hotel across the street, which you need to check in was pleasant and hassle free. This hotel was not the greatest but the reviews were helpful before I checked in and it worked for me.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20159196">Stayed there on a weekend when it was impossible to find a room in Seattle. It was a bit high priced, $160 after taxes, but it wasn't that bad at all. Doing my research I found that this building used to be an apartment building turned hotel/inn. The rooms are very apartment like and was very surprised at the size of the room! (Room 811). There was construction around the inn, but none going on during our stay on a Saturday night. The air conditioning faired well, and the very old TV served us well in the morning. The elevator is not as rickety as described. The hill is a bit steep, but if you're younger it's do-able. Very close to Pike Market and close to Seattle Center, the Space Needle is a short Monorail ride away.

We had just come off the I-5 after a HOT day of driving and there was no air conditioning, which was not mentioned on the website. There was a note on the window asking that we leave windows closed as there were renovations going on at the hospital 20 feet away from the hotel, also not mentioned on the website. We had to wait for the ancient elevator to go up one floor because the stairwells were closed due to renovations going on in the hotel...again, not mentioned on the website. The room we had was very old, dingy and smelled stale, and there were dried drips and spots on the bathroom walls. Construction went on until at least 7pm and started again at 6:30am. Both available parking garages were located down a very steep hill. These things should be taken into consideration for people staying there for medical reasons.

It's located about seven blocks (up some very steep hills) from the water front. It's perhaps about 3/4 of a mile from downtown and located in a quiet neighborhood. We chose this hotel because of its proximity to downtown and its price. When you walk in the lobby is nice, staff are friendly. It turned out a number of rooms were available and the woman at the front desk talked us through which room we'd like based on the view. The room was really large. There was even a "changing area" adjacent to the bathroom. The room had a fantastic view of downtown Seattle and the waterfront. The Hotel is attached to a hospital that bears the same name. Many of the people staying there were clearly there for medical reasons. It's for that reason why I would slightly hesitate to recommend the hotel to leisure travelers. Having said that, it's really nice inside, and you'd never know it was attached to a hospital if you didn't see the signs directing you to where the hospital is.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5576196">This was a decent, quiet little hotel. Given that it was one of the cheapest we could find in the city, I should be giving it a much higher rating. The rooms were clean and the air conditioning decent (this was important given the heat wave we encountered). It is conveniently located a short walk from downtown. Athough as has been mentioned there's an incredibly steep hill you'll have to climb if you want to walk back. Okay neighbourhood, we never felt insecure about walking around at night. The staff were very friendly upon arrival and were able to give us information on local events and attractions. We only spent one night here and didn't try the restaurant. The rest of our stay in Seattle we rented a small studio/cottage on Bainbridge Island for only $150/night (highly recommended as the prices are cheaper than in Seattle and it's only a 30 min, $6 return ferry ride right downtown)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3742128">If you arrive in downtown Seattle via public transportation, the first thing you'll notice about Virginia Mason is the hike up First Hill.

We were able to walk to most of the attractions in Seattle from the hotel: downhill to the waterfront, over to the Space Needle, back to Pioneer Square. Though the kids complained about the lack of a pool, the room itself was spacious and clean, with a bathroom big enough for a small party and enough beds to accommodate our family of six. The staff was pleasant and accommodating, plus the place felt cozy--a pleasant contrast to the chains where we spent most of our vacation.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3722050">We reserved room 611 for the nights of July 25-26, 2005. We arrived on 7-25 as expected and found our room waiting. It was nice, clean and comfortable. My wife was having brain aneurism surgery on the morning of 7-26, so we left early. My son had driven in that morning and we were going to use the same room that night. He was replacing my wife as she was in ICU. At 11:45 am we called to make sure the room was available and we were told it was all ready for us. That evening we left the ICU and got back to the room about 10:30 PM. We immediately found someone else in our room (611). The desk was very helpful and tried to find us a room in another hotel to no avail. A lady assisted the clerk and located a room in the hotel that no one was using (604). We waited for it to be cleaned. She came back and said she would 'comp' the room to us for the night of 7-26 since they had given our original room away. She then said they would hold that room for us since my wife was to be released on 7-27 and the hospital wanted us to stay in Seattle one more night before returning to our home in Spokane, Wa. We would pay for the 2nd night in room 604. My wife was released from ICU at 7:30 PM. We started for our room, but just to be safe, I called ahead only to learn that it too had been given to someone else during the day. The same lady that had saved it for us was the one I talked to. Again, she was very nice and apologized, but we had no room. We were asked to come over and they would see if there was anything they could do about locating something else since they were full. At this point with my wife hurting and in need of a place to stay, we decided to head east toward home and see if we could locate something else which we finally did...in Ellensburg.

The wall extended way, way, WAY above our room but there was probably a sky up there somewhere. Avoid the rooms that look that way at all costs. We met others who stayed there at the same time and they had a few good things to say about the hotel so we will try not to be too hard on the Marqueen. Breakfast is interesting with only 5-tables available for the entire hotel. So grab your dried muesli and take it back to your room. The hotel describes itself as 'boutique'. Where that came from is anyones guess but there is something oddly quaint about the place. Just make sure you are put in the rooms on the upper floors. One oddity. There is a tiny kitchenette but no kettle, so we aske for one. It arrived promptly but was one that had to to be placed on a cook-top (not an electric kettle). There is no cook-top!

She chose the hotel due to its proximity to her apt. We had four rooms and each was nice. Upon check-in, one of the rooms needed to be changed to include a pull-out bed (this was done expeditiously!) The staff quickly learned who we were and greeted us each time we passed the front desk. The rooms were perfect for a family gathering as each had a small kitchen and sitting area. We were able to meet for "happy hour" before dinner each evening. The decor is Queen Anne style (I think) with wingback chairs and wonderful chandeliers, wood floors and nice area rugs. The hotel is small - only three floors and does not have an elevator. The stairs are in the style of a grand staircase and my 3-year old granddaughter loved making an entrance to the lobby. The free breakfast was minimal - yogurt, bagels, cream cheese, oatmeal packets, oatmeal bars, coffee, and tea - but worked well for us as we were eating big lunches and dinners. There are many good restaurants VERY near the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115879653">Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a boutique hotel... although it bills itself as such. Rough towels, hard pillows, roly-poly mattress (bed moves sideways every time someone moves), worst breakfast we ever had in a hotel or even an inexpensive motel (plain bagels, no pastries or other bread items, cheap yogurt, instant oatmeal, no juice, whole apples, no banana or berries). Great big rooms but those in front of building don't have windows that open and some (like the one we had the first night) don't have a ceiling fan. The only way to get air movement was to run the air conditioner (very noisy and made it too cold). It was too stuffy so we asked for a portable fan. None available on site and desk clerk offered no options. We asked for the manager who was more helpful and we consented to a room switch to the back, looking at a painted brick wall but at least the window opened and it was quiet. Having a kitchen is great if you want to cook a quick meal but the Marqueen's kitchens provide no pots and pans or utensils. Only silverware, glasses and plates. Good luck! Location is good -- near Seattle Center, buses, some restaurants, foot of Queen Anne hill (good walking and views). Rooms are big and have sofas and/or chairs and decent TV. Be aware, there's no elevator but bellmen are great in hauling bags up and downstairs. Paid through Hotels.com so got a reduced rate.

Cons: In general everything is just a little old and worn (which is fine if you're looking for that); the nighttime staff was hit or miss, sometimes not even acknowledging our having entered the hotel lobby; it seems a little pricey for what you get; there are stains on the carpet in the hallways; the breakfast fare is little better than what one would get in a budget chain motel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115638670">I had stayed here a number of times over the past four years, then I showed up with a reservation and they said they were "overbooked."

What that means is that it's kind of like going to a hotel as it was back in about the 20s. The building was NOT just gutted and a new hotel build inside the exterior walls of a very old building. The result if fun but its probably not for everyone. If you want everything to look ultra-modern, the MarQueen is not for you. If you're in for some luxury from yesteryear, it's a grand place to stay. One fact to its "restored" basis is that although it is three stories, there is no elevator. So, the busmen really earn their tips helping people with bags. Another is that all the fixtures in the bathroom look old. (It's not original equipment but new equipment made to look like something from the 20s.) Some folks may not like that. There is a kitchenette in every room. However, I doubt that many people use it extensively. It's in a fun neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and things and people to see. The "room service" for the MarQueen comes from one of the restaurants for breakfast, another for lunch, and yet another for dinner. That includes a late-night bar scene.

This was (I think) staff accom for a company, so the rooms are a bit larger than normal, and had a small kitchenette, which could be useful if you were staying a few days. Our first room was at the front, smelled odd, and we couldn't open the windows.

I love the area because of its bohemian up-market flair and walking distance to the Seattle Center and performing arts district. I often select hotels like the MarQueen for their unique style, history and charm. I have stayed before and had a pleasant visit. This time, when I walked into my room, I immediately went to open a window, taking advantage of the clear Seattle fresh air. Of the several windows in my room, none were functional. The windows have been covered up with a clear storm window, providing excellent insulation and noise abatement, but making it impossible to open any window. When I enquired at the front desk, I was told that all windows in the hotel had received this treatment. No where does the hotel say that they have "hermatically sealed" every window. Old, charming hotels like the MarQueen need fresh air. Otherwise, we are back to the tall highrise hotels that I avoid for this very reason. If having the window open when you sleep is an important facet of your hotel selection and stay, then, regretfully, the MarQueen is not the place. I hope management reconsiders this decision and makes a few rooms accessible to the fresh air, which Seattle has in unlimitted supply.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR74844145">A friend of ours from Seattle found this hotel for us. It is located on Queen Anne neighborhood and within walking distance of Space Needle and some of the museums nearby as well as the "Ride the Ducks". You can also take the monorail from there to downtown for $2. There is a bus that stops near the hotel. There were several good restaurants within a block or two, including a great bakery and a block away was a24 hour grocery market and a drugstore. The hotel is in an older rennovated building. The room had 2 queen beds, a kitchen with bench, a sitting area with internet connection, and a bathroom. The beds were fairly comfortable but they squeaked whenever you moved. The wooden floor also squeaked when you walked on them. It was hard for the doors not to slam shut, so you could hear other doors slam, just the way they were built. It was not a problem for us, but there is no elevator. If you have any problems with older stairs, you want to be sure to get a room on the first floor. Do not count on the continental breakfast. It was only tea and coffee with croissants and oatmeal/breakfast bars. I wouldn't even have minded having croissants, except these were not very good ones. There wasn't anything to my son's liking for breakfast, so we ended up buying cereal and milk at the market. This is a boutique motel, so there is no swimming pool, hot tub, etc. There is a nice coffee shop attached to the building. There is only valet parking, which will add to your hotel bill. I believe there is room service from nearby restaurants, but we didn't use it. If you want to stay in this location, this is a good choice.

Interesting area with many restaurants and a lot going on. Bus stop only a block away. I was not bothered by late-night noise, as some people have written they were. There is a coffee maker in the kitchen of the apartment/ room, and a full-size refrigerator. Microwave, no stove; Iron and ironing board. Free Wi-Fi.

There is NO ELEVATOR, and so either you need to carry your bag to the 2nd or 3rd floor, or you need the bellhop to do this. Going up and down the stairs several times each day was wearing. For many people, the hotel is perceived as charming and quaint - I saw many positive, even raving, comments in the guest book at checkout. I found it too old and drab for my taste.

We stayed on the street side on a weekend night and the room was far quieter than you would expect from a city hotel on a busy street. Lots of amenities near by, which is great if you plan to use the kitchen. Old building with lots of character, but lacks an elevator.

Great shower. Very nice staff. Cons: We rented a suite so that my daughter could sleep on the pullout couch. My daughter is definitely NOT fussy -- she has slept in all kinds of primitive conditions--however, she could not sleep on the couch-- when we opened it up the mattress was extremely thin, flimsy--not something you could sleep on-- also, the sheets we were provided did not fit on the bed. In conclusion, if you stay at the Marqueen and don't need to use a pullout couch (or don't get a suite -- just get a room with a bed) you'll like it a lot--- but if you need a separate sleeping space for another person (child, whatever) rent two rooms or go elsewhere. Another con-- the breakfast needs improvement. Could be easily improved by supplying milk for coffee and warm (not just out of the freezer) croissants. Also, since fresh fruit is readily available in Seattle, adding fruit would be a plus.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR65294814">I live in Tacoma and stayed at the MarQueen Hotel last Saturday.

It is really old and outdated, I suppose some would find that quaint but it was loud and musty smelling. The carpets in the hallway were badly stained. The floors in the room were wood but pretty old. The bathroom was tiny and the flooring was this old, ratty linoleum. I was afraid to walk in the room with bare feet. I had seen where previous reviews mentioned how loud it was outside the hotel. It was awful. There are a couple of bars across the street and due to the pumping music and loud voices, it felt like the bar was in my room. Combined with the traffic on the street, the noise was unbearable. After the first night, I asked if we could switch rooms to the inside section of the hotel. The staff did not seem at all surprised by my request but said there were no other rooms to switch to. I get the feeling that it is a common request. I got stuck with this hotel by using Priceline.

It wasn't long after check in that I needed some ice. After roaming the halls and not finding an ice machine I call the front desk, only to find that there is no self serve ice machine... ok, I could live with that, but waiting for it to be delivered (30 minutes later) was not okay. Next up, I decide to take advantage of their shuttle service... of course that is not as advertised- it must be arranged 24 hours in advance and only stops at a few locations at fixed times throughout the day! Inconvenient and impractical. Ask the front desk for directions, tourist advice, ANYTHING, and you're confronted with a whole lot of Uhhhh's and hmmmm's. Not helpful! All of this I could deal with, but the clincher came when the "free wi-fi in every room" wasn't working in our room. I went to the front desk and told an (overwhelming) blond agent my problem, and she said that the wi-fi was complimentary and thus not guaranteed. When I pressed the issue, she said she'd talk to the manager, but as I walked away she said some incredibly rude and degrading things about me!!! Of course, I was eventually contacted by a manager who said there was nothing she could do about the internet, but when I told her what the front desk agent had said,she said I must have misheard!!!

It is an old and partially renovated apartment building (I say partially, because the vault of the rooms are basically untouched beyond paint, the floors need a good polish and kitchens are not updated) with pleasant and tasteful decor. Our room had a fairly new Queen Anne (?) style bedroom set and a nice small sitting area, but really could not escape the feeling of just being old. The advantages are clear: it is a good value if you can get a room in the lower $100's (the rack rates are not a great value), it is walking distance to a number of theaters, activities and neighborhood restaurants, the kitchen is a nice plus (so you can stay in a hotel and box your unfinished dinner), street parking is available in an area that is not so seedy that you don't get over the initial nerves and the rooms are pretty comfortable if you can get past the lack of updated trimmings. By the way, our doorman was unusually attentive. Maybe someone reads these reviews... ;-)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20481895">As many other travelers have noted, this is a beautiful old building (actually a former apartment building) on the fringe of downtown Seattle. The hotel is located at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, a lively commercial and nightspot area. The building itself has a lot of potential. It was built around the turn of the 20th century, and is loaded with "Old World Charm", as they say. The owners have tried - rightly - to capitalize on this heritage, with historic photos on the wall, and Victorian-style potted palms and plants in oversized urns. There are lovely oriental carpets and the rooms are large- - they are really "single" apartments (size-wise they are between a one bedroom and a studio). So what's the problem? There are a few, actually. We noted that the management has TRIED to capitalize on the historic nature of the building, but they have come up a bit short. To wit: The aforementioned potted plants? Fake. The oriental carpets (and the rest of the carpeting, for that matter) were tired and dingy. Not filthy, but dowdy. The red carpet (a nice touch) on the marble steps at the main entrance was marred by two crushed cork-tipped cigarette butts on the night we arrived. These details belie a standard of cleanliness and care that is noticeably below par. The place aims to be your glamorous old aunt but actually comes off a bit dowdy. The old girl needs a good scrubbing and some TLC. Then there is the matter of service. We have stayed at the Marqueen three times, and the service has been uneven. Sometimes very good, but more often simply lackadaisical, and occasionally surly. (Open note to management: An establishment that employs a "doorman" should instruct that person to OPEN THE DOOR for people as they approach, and not merely watch as patrons struggle to do so on their own). One gets the impression that these problems -- irritating though they may be -- are not insurmountable. Nothing that a visit to the beauty parlor for the building, and a refresher course in boardinghouse manners for the staff couldn't cure.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20380186">My family and I stayed at the Marqueen in early September, and we were thrilled with the lovely charm and ambience of the hotel. It felt more like our own little apartment room rather than a plain hotel room. My wife especially loved the little 'sitting room' area. There was a nice little kitchenette in our room, but please be warned that there are little or no utensils in order to cook anything more than a very simple packet meal. We are used to self contained rooms in most hotels including mixing bowls, can openers, cork removers, olive oil and other basics, but you don't get any of that here. Nevertheless, there are a couple of great supermarkets only a block away which can supply these and lots of great ingredients to cook. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Seattle Center and Space Needle. We stayed here for nearly 2 weeks, and had absolutely no noise problems from the surrounding bars or other rooms. We were on the second floor facing at the back of the hotel. Definitely a highly recommended property, and we would stay there again if ever in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20199346">The pictures online tell a different story.. The Lobby area was nice, as were the staff. There is no ice in the rooms or in a self serve location. I had to call room service for ice, and after 20 miniutes I went down to the desk and got it myself. Very dissapointed in the room, old and dumpy! The plummbing is not much better. Their restaurant is across the street, if you want room service from there it's 20% service charge + 18% gratuity???? Oh! and to park your car, it's $20.00 per night. My room was right across the street from a bar/restaurant that was noisy all night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18680448">3 stories, no elevator. nice room that was a converted apartment. small kitchen area, nice view of the space needle.

Nice friendly staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16706815">This hotel is lovely and in a great location. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The desk and service personnel are knowledgeable and helpful without fail EXCEPT in one very important area: The only problem, and it was a major one for me, was that they refused to take our party of eight (we booked four rooms) to the Pier to meet our cruise. One of the main reasons we booked with this hotel was because of the transportation to the Pier. We were told that we could not monopolize the transportation (?) but no explanation was given as to why four couples could not be provided transportation. Evidently if we'd been four separate couples taking the same cruise but not acquainted they would have had no problem. We managed to find transportation at a very significant cost. The day we left, after moving our bags to the lobby and after our transportation arrived I inquired again as to their policy....and was told I had been given incorrect information and they would have taken us. Strange...as they refused to schedule us but then said they would have taken us if we were scheduled. Overall this is a good place to stay, but beware of transportation promises, it may not be there when you need it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16114422">We stayed at the hotel over the weekend and were very impressed by the staff and very happy with the property and the room. It's nice to stay in a hotel with some character and not the same box feel. The room was in excellent condition and looked freshly painted. We had a large comfortable king bed (though the pillows were a little on the firm side for our liking) and enjoyed having the full kitchenette (even complete with a wine opener ;-). All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay. We were on the third floor, directly across from the bar mentioned in previous posts (I had it confused with the piano bar behind the hotel when I checked in and requested our room location). The first night we experienced the same noise referenced in other posts, but the next day I realized that the windows weren't fully latched. Once latched, the noise wasn't nearly as noticeable the second night and we got a good night sleep. We noticed no noise from inside the hotel. We also had massages with the spa in the hotel and they were very enjoyable as well. This is a great hotel for someone looking for something off the beaten path. It is very convenient to downtown and there are a number of coffee shops, bars and restaurants in the immediate neighborhood.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11014547">The room was very spacious, and had a charming, vintage feel. There was no elevator, which we didn't realize when we booked, so it was kind of a drag climbing the stairs with bags, but the exercise was good for us! There's a very good (and sometimes busy) coffee shop next door, accessible through the lobby, which was a nice convenience. I liked the area very much, kind of off the main tourist track, with some cute restaurants and shops nearby. Drawbacks were lack of onsite parking--we had to wait for the valet to retrieve the car each time we needed it--and no wi-fi--it took one of the staff many trips to figure out how to connect our laptop to the internet with the ethernet cable they supplied. Overall, I liked the Marqueen, and would recommend it for someone who likes something different and a bit funky.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10930608">I was in Seattle for work and wanted to find a good value compared to the expensive conference hotels downtown. The Marqueen provides good value and is more of a European style hotel, except the rooms are actually more like large studio apartments including a kitchenette, large bath and walk-in closet. The bed and linens were comfortable and the hotel is located in lower Queen Anne in close proximity to some great bars and restaurants, but it is not walking distance to downtown and public transportation options are limited. There is a great coffee shop attached to the hotel and but no restaurant -- no need in this area of the city. This hotel is for a particular type of client. If you are looking for a Sheraton or Holiday Inn, this is not your type of place. If you want a friendly and home-like atmosphere with lots of room to rest your weary body -- then this is your place. PS Noticed no particular musty smells in the lobby or the room and I am usually VERY sensitive to these things.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10351868">Spent a week in Seattle staying at the Marqueen, handy for the Seattle Centre and Space Needle and only a monorail ride or quick bus trip to the heart of downtown with plenty of bars and restuarants in the area if you want to eat locally. Rooms are big and come with a fully equipped kitchen and mine was comfortable and clean. Plumbing was rather antiquated but eveything worked which was the important thing. Front desk staff were attentive and helpful and happy to provide advice and guidance on local amenities. If you're a light sleeper I suggest you ask for a room at the rear, my room was at the front as the proximity of the main road and bars and restaurants means some late night noise, particularly at the weekend. It didn't stop me getting a good nights sleep, more of an issue was the noise from the fridge in the kitchen which I found it best to turn off overnight. Overall, I'd be happy to stay again at this well-appointed and individual hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8721140">I read all the reviews, but questioned if they were "planted" or for real. Well, they were for real. Everything we asked for was taken care of immediatly. It was as if the desk staff knew what we wanted before asking. Loved the room, especially the kitchen and small reading/parlor. Robes were provided as well as coffee and tea. We did some shopping at the market down the street which saved us a few dollars on food but don't miss Peco's restaurant across the street. They have a Happy Hour breakfast between 9:00am and 11:am with just about anything on the menu for $6.00. Lots of other dining options within a few short blocks. Should we return to Seattle, this will be our first stop.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7238305">I stayed at the MarQueen for business the week of March 19th. Positives: As noted by other reviewers, the room was large, including a kitchenette, large sleeping area, walk-in closet and average sized bathroom. The service was excellent: attentive and efficient. And, the hotel itself is in a good location, with lots of restaurants nearby, and it is just a couple of blocks to attractions like the Space Needle, Key Arena, and others. Negatives: Again as noted by other reviewers, the place smells. A musty, stale, smell hangs over the lobby, and exists throughout the hotel. The lobby itself has a run-down look, as did my room. Threadbare rugs on floors, worn hardwood, all the polish off the bathtub, bathroom floor tile in desperate need of re-grouting, worn doorhandles, creaky floors....the list goes on. I get that the motif is going for a jazz age atmosphere, but I've been in hotels that manage character without looking, feeling, and smelling worn. Warnings: A couple of things didn't bother me, but might put off other travellers. First, there's no elevator (the hotel has only 3 floors). Second, my room at the front of the hotel was subject to a good deal of street noise: the street outside seems a busy thoroughfare for cars, and the restaurants/night spots seemed to spit out handfuls of loud (but not rowdy) crowds each night. Not overbearing noise, but noticeable. Booking through Expedia cost me about $160/night. Not expensive for the location, but given that there were other hotels nearby also in that price range, I have a feeling there's a better option in the neighbourhood than the MarQueen.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6941605">My husband, teenage son and I stayed here over the weekend as the boys were going to a Sonics game. They were able to walk a few blocks to the Key Arena. The valets were excellent! Best service we have ever seen. They opened doors, carried baggage, parked our car, and generally hopped to our every need. Parking is $18 per night, but that is reasonable for a Seattle city hotel. Once you step into the lobby of the MarQueen, you know it's old. It's got beautiful wood floors, large chandeliers, velvet drapes and antique furniture. Our room was much of the same... polished, creaky wooden floors; a long kitchen with a booth to eat breakfast and a full refrigerator/microwave; a small living room with a loveseat and recliner; and comfy beds. There was also loads of Seattle Magazines on the coffee table. We found great places to see and eat at in those magazines. I used the monorail to get to the downtown shopping area. You can also ride the bus or take a taxi. Parking is terrible downtown. The hotel has a car that will take you places as well. (they don't promise they can pick you up however). Cafe Ladro (next door) has the Best soy latte I have ever had. They also have pies, quiche, muffins and soup. If you like brand new hotels ...then this one won't be for you. If you are like me and appreciate the character and history of these older hotels, then try the MarQueen. We'll be going back!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6024262">My wife and I booked one night at the Inn at Queen Anne in September 2006. The Inn at Queen Anne is the sister hotel of the MarQueen Hotel. Even though we had booked our room five months in advance, upon arrival we were told that they did not have a room for us but advised they had booked us into the MarQueen around the corner. The MarQueen is an old style hotel. There was very limited parking out front but we were lucky enough to get a park whilst we unloaded our bags. Fortunately for us, we were taking the car back to the rental depot so didn't have to worry about parking. The room we were given was large with a separate kitchen and lounge. The kitchen had a microwave and fridge. There was a large TV with all the usual channels. Everything was really good until we turned off the TV to go to bed. It was then that we heard the noise from the music and the people across the road at a restaurant/club. The noise got progressively louder. We rang the desk to find out how long it goes for and were advised 2.00 am. They offered to ring the establishment if we wanted (couldn't imagine that working) or we could use the ear plugs in the 'honour bar' (at a cost - I think it was $1). The fact that they had ear plugs available made me think that this is a regular occurrence. We certainly were not forewarned by the staff. Just as we were told, the noise continued until just after 2.00 am. Breakfast was not provided at this hotel. As you can imagine, we were not overjoyed at initially being turned away from the hotel we booked, only to be sent to another hotel ( allegedly a higher rating) where we were kept awake until 2.00 am. Considering the stuff ups, I was concerned we may have been charged the higher rate at the MarQueen, than our initial hotel, so I enquired at the desk. We were then advised that, because of the mix up with the bookings, we would not be charged at all. We thought that was good public relations considering what had occurred.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6010824">This is a good value hotel in the trendy Queen Anne district of Seattle.

The hotel has an all-pervading stale smell and this extended to our bed which smelled as if the previous occupants were feline! We probably should have checked out after one night but we only had one full day in Seattle and we didn't want to waste it searching for a hotel. On our second night we worked out that if you leave the fan on the smell isn't quite as overpowering. While the Marqueen is within 10-15 minutes walk of downtown Seattle there must be better hotels more centrally located for the $175 per night plus tax that we paid. We are not going back to this hotel and would not recommend it to friends.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5631616">If you don't need an elevator, this is a wonderful find in the Queen Anne district near Seattle Center.

Perhaps I should have complained then as I received a call from manager of the hotel a couple hours later accusing me of smoking in the room. I explained the situation to him and thought it was settled. Unfortunately when I checked out several days later, the hotel added a smoking charge to the bill. I asked to speak to the manager who was very rude and said he would not remove the charge. I asked him to go up to the room with me to see himself if the inside of my room was smoke filled.

So what is the point of moving? We stayed in the same room. Very cramped space for 2 people. Ok if alone. Parking is 29$ not 20$ as listed in the Expedia website.

I booked this hotel for a one night stay in order to photograph Seattle. I try to review various hotels, especially if the experience is significant. The Mayflower Park was a massive disappointment in -Appearance -Accommodation -Most importantly, customer service. Check-in was average; however I noticed that in the "business center" (standing kiosks only) we could see guests conducting their business at computer stations. The room was shabby at best, and about the size of a closet. We walked in and noticed that the room was dingy, small, and had only one bed. I am disabled; room size is easy to overlook, if the room is presented acceptably and I can get around. We requested a second bed: No can do. We requested audience with a manager and let him know very clearly we were not happy. He was accusatory and combative, but kindly offered a roll-away bed. We finally conceded, and the manager continued to be combative. After that was over, we decided to see the city. Apparently the hotel was connected to access for various methods of transportation. Not for us; we were sent outside and around the building as the result of an event happening at the hotel. Again, I'm disabled which is unfortunately clearly visible. Regardless, we were sent outside in slick rain on concrete, with no assistance offered by doormen. I had to grapple down wet cement stairs and into rain. After clearing yet another flight of stairs, we made it to our transportation. Upon our return to the hotel, we called to request a roll away. After four hours and three calls to the front desk, it came. An employee set it up, and left absolutely no clear path to the restroom as a result of the small room. That is not possible for me-again, he could see that I was in need of better accommodation, so he moved furniture all over the place attempting to clear a small opening for me to reach a restroom in the night. Up to this point the entire hotel experience had not only been inconvenient, but extremely dangerous. Then our neighbors chirped in. We could hear the conversations of hotel guests in rooms next to us through the walls. The next morning, we checked out.

This New Years Eve, my husband and I got a room that was more like a closet- it was clean enough, except that it had a musty smell with the addition of the aroma of old food and dirty carpet. The bathroom was in need of a total- gutting. Mold, broken tiles, chipped paint and altogether way too small to get dressed in ease and comfort. My toiletries fell off of the little ledge into the toilet, which by the way was jammed up against the wall- not comfortable or hygenic in my opinion. This hotel should shut rooms down and revise the floor plan- the rates they charge would then be realistic for the room size and better set up.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR91069410">This hotel is extremely well located.

A short walk to Pikes Market and other downtown places, and near the monorail to the Seattle Tower/Needle - well worth a trip and lunch). We were impressed by the Concierge service before we even arrived - Wendy (chef Concierge) kindly emailed me very detailed and helpful explanation of the various ways of getting from Seatac airport to hotel, which were spot on. During our two stays (on the way in to Washington state - 3 night stay, and on the way out - 1 night stay) the Concierges helped us immensly. Top marks for that. Check in was brief and courteous, but a "doorman"? (or perhaps he was just a flunky dressed up to stand around uselessly) watched my wife and I struggle on through the front door (here there are no bellhops) with three suitcases, but didnt even come to hold the door open for us! On the other (side) door, there are several bellhops who are very helpful and courteous. During our 2nd stay, there was a conference going on which took over the upper section of the lobby, where we previously had enjoyed sitting and reading, and which also meant the exit to the mall and train centre next door was locked. Noisy, too, with recpetions going on a lot, drowning out the ablity to hold a conversation in reception at times. Perhaps the hotel should organise a private room for these events. Otherwise, very enjoyable stay, and<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR81794730">I was there during a warm spell and I guess it was too warm outside for my room to get comfortable because the air conditioner was just not strong enough.

This location is the best---Westlake Center is in the same block (and Westlake Center is really "ground zero" for downtown Seatte). The light rail stop is very close (and that is the best and cheapest way downtown from the airport). But the best thing about the Mayflower is the staff. Five stars isn't high enough for them. When you ask the staff how long they have worked there it's usually decades not years. It's hard to find someone who has been there less than 5 years---in many other hotels it's hard to find someone who has been there there 5 years. It's not like working in a hotel is a glanorous job, so the owners and management must be doing something right and it shows. They are loyal to the hotel and guests. If you're looking for a place to stay in downtown Seattle, quit looking and book here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR63958497">Hotel is nice and clean, but is really nothing special. The location is good for the centre of town and is close to the market if you want to visit there. The hotel itself didn't do anything to offend us but ...is just didn't feel as good as I expected.

In all we had 6 rooms, 3 generations. The hotel is very well located and is a very nice small hotel. The rooms and the lobby appear to have been renovated fairly recently. The lobby is small but nicely appionted. The restaurant is very nice - reasonably priced with well above average food. My wife and I requested a deluxe queen. The hotel only advertised that they had 3 types of rooms - Standard queen, Deluxe queen (larger) and Double queen. Upon arrival were were put into a King room (the clerk explained that they only have about a half dozen king rooms) Our room was very large - could have accomodated another King with adaquate walking room remaining. The double queen rooms appeared somewhat more cramped, with limited space next to the beds. As is common in older hotels, electric outlets is a bit of a challenge. No extra power near the bed, and we had to rotate power supplies to keep a laptop, cell phone and blackberry's all charged. One significant negative is the very VERY small bathrooms. A tub, sink and camode with room to stand is all you get. Nice shampoo and conditioner in large wall mounted pump bottles in the shower, a bar of soap and towels. No extras. My mother in law complained that there was nowhere to hang a towel - the only towel bar is in over the bathtub. The only other significant complaint is that the 2 very small elevators are inadaquate to service the 10 floor hotel. 4 - 5 minute waiting times were normal during peak hours. Each elevator can handle only 6 people at a time so arriving at the lobby to find 10 people waiting (happened more than once in our week long stay) resulted in an unacceptable wait. One other point to note - the matresses are rather firm. Great for my wife, not so great for me. I would probably stay here again, the location, amazing service and charm are worth the small bathroom. I would prearrange a 2nd or 3rd floor room however so I could avoid the elevators.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR60564671">I chose the Mayflower Park carefully on the basis of reviews, for a week's stay in Seattle to visit our son at Uni and to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary. We were looking forward to old fashioned charm and good service. Instead, we got a poky room with thin walls between the humming ice machine and the elevator with an air con system that rattled so much we had to turn it off before we went to bed! The bathroom was so small we could hardly turn round with the door closed ( we are both slim!) it was tatty and the shower-or rather the tap in the walll above the bath) was woefully inadequate. Our check in should have warned us. It was stiff, unfriendly and were were obviously just a bit of a nuisance. I had written to the hotel before our stay telling them about our celebrations and asking if they could just put a note on my husband's pillow ( 'The best husband in the world sleeps here') or something similar. They claimed not to have received my e mail and had no knowledge of a similar note added to our booking form and couldn't care less that our room and the lack of attention has spoiled the stay for me even before it started. I commented in a disappointed way rather than complain as I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my husband. But there was no apology-just defensiveness. We were rather begrudgingly given a free drink in the bar as compensation. The bar, however, ( Olivers) is fabulous-best martini ever. The staff here were friendly and delightful and the restaurant was great. The hotel is also very central-right next to the Westlake Centre and transport links. We made the best of the room as it was obvious that there was no point in commenting further and I didn't want to spoil our trip. But we came to the conclusion that The Mayflower does not want to know you unless you have paid top prices for their best rooms. We just felt as if we were there to fill the gap. Very, very disappointing.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR59527003">We stayed at the Mayflower Park for 2 nights during a recent house hunting trip in Washington.

Overall, it was a good experience and I would probably go back there again. There were some things that could have been better. First, the positives: POSITIVES -Hotel is centrally located. You can walk to everything. -If you need to get a cab somewhere, the guys out front are the best. They are very friendly and will help with practically anything. -Clean rooms -one day we didn't even leave the room. Housekeeping called to check if we wanted our room cleaned and just asked that we let them know if we wanted towels or anything. -Good pressure and temp in the shower at any time of day. -Good WiFi. Just call down to the front desk for the password. NEGATIVES -the pillows were way too soft! my neck hurt by the end of the trip and we had too much stuff to travel with to bring my own pillow. this is just my opinion, though. -They got rid of the vending machines. You could either buy a $4 bottle of water in the room (not worth it), or hike it a few blocks to Ralph's market where you can buy the same water for half the price. -We went to eat at Oliver's lounge, attached to the hotel. The menu at the lounge was not the same as the one in the room and we ended up not being able to eat anything there. -no room service except for breakfast. -the bathroom is a little tight. the toliet is practially up against the wall. The negatives weren't a make or break thing for us and it's all just my personal preference. It's a nice hotel, I would just be prepared for these few things.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR42159894">From the care of my luggage, the ease of checking in, to the guidance from the concierge staff, the Mayflower Park Hotel provided me with excellent service. My adult daughter was my travel partner and our deluxe room had two bathrooms and a wonderful view from the window. The amenities (robe, newspaper, coffee maker, safe, large screen TV, etc.) were great and a shopping mall was available through a connecting pass way. The concierge staff provided great information and assisted with dining reservations.

We stayed one night and flew out the next morning. The room was pretty but very small. We arrived early after getting off the cruise ship so we asked that our luggage be stored while we explored the city. We sat in the lobby for 25 minutes, eyeing our luggage that the staff stacked in a corner, unattended, hoping no one made off with it. No one seemed concerned about unattended luggage and it was totally ignored. I wouldn't leave until I made sure someone actually took the luggage and stored it. After 25 minutes, a bellhop finally came and got our luggage. We were going to go into the mall and ride the monorail but being this early on Sunday morning, the mall doors were still locked (it was about 10:30). So, we had to exit the hotel and walk to the monorail. When we got back, we checked in and our luggage was retrieved. Our room was pretty but nothing special. It actually wasn't much larger than our cabin on the cruise ship. It was comfortable, clean. Late that afternoon, after exploring Seattle, we decided to rest in our room. We looked in the hotel directory and my husband went to find a vending machine so we could enjoy a soft drink. There weren't any to be found. After calling the front desk we discovered the only way to obtain a soft drink was to go to the bar. We thought this was pretty bad for a hotel of this caliber not to have vending machines and force people to buy a soft drink at a high price in the bar. Needless to say, this did not endear us to this hotel. We've stayed at better hotels. Next time we'll stay at the Grand Hyatt.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37951744">My daughter and I just spent a few days at the Mayflower and brought along my three month-old granddaughter.

We were forced to valet park since that was our only option. All the bellman were too busy talking to each - other to notice us. The door was very heavy and older people would have a large struggle to get in. At the front the desk everything was very dis-organized. The man at the front desk who seemed to young to be the manager was talking to the other agents while they were trying to check in people. The way he talked to people was quite rude. There was another young man who left the front desk to help with luggage and answer questions. The "business center" is a joke where you have to stand since there are no chairs and wait for your documents to be printed at the front desk . The rooms are dusty and old . I dont understand how this place got such great reviews since this is why I stayed here but obviously these people are used to an econo lodge or something.

Service: Friendly and helpful from the bellboy to the front desk. They gladly held our luggage when we needed and valet was polite and efficient. Location: Great as it is right downtown Seattle so in walking distance or short ride away from all major attractions. Value: I booked through Priceline so got a good deal but that also came at a price (see rooms below). Rooms: I think because we got a good deal that we were also given the most terrible room in the building. Firstly, the room is completely dated - it looks and feels as though it was built in the early 1950s. TV is old, bathrooms were small and dingy looking with terrible looking tiles and a very small tub, plumbing could use some work as the water was either too hot or too cold and made a lot of noise when showering, carpets seemed ingrained with dirt, small room and the only window we had was facing the air conditioning vent and nothing else. We could barely see skies outside our window. I would never wish this kind of room on anyone. We even switched hotels after one night since we couldn't believe this is what we paid for. I would recommend to stay away from this hotel if possible. I don't know how people could give this place 5 stars when it is just so old and outdated. Staff are very friendly but the rooms were just atrocious.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26955301">I was quite happy at the Mayflower and would stay there again either on business or leisure. It had a lot of historic charm while still being clean and up to date. Some of the complaints are true--there is some noise from traffic outside (though it definitely dies down at night and if you are particularly sensitive, ear plugs would do the trick), no real counter space in the bathroom, no fancy flat screen tv--but the location (an easy walk to the Market, the monorail, and to Dahlia's-yum!), the comfortable pretty room with nice beds and towels, and the excellent service overrode these minor problems. The front desk and the room service waiters were particularly friendly and thoughtful. I had a deluxe room which was plenty spacious; however, the regular rooms I poked my head in, while still nice, were definitely smaller--I'd recommend springing for the deluxe--the rate was only slightly higher.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25815680">I had always intended to stay at 3 hotels either side of a conference at Microsoft in Bellevue so I could see which one I wanted to stay at on my next visit. I booked my first night at the Mayflower Park as I needed an address for the visa waiver form, however I had to move rooms as soon as I arrived due to noise, despite requesting a quiet room on the booking and again during the check in. The second room was adequate however it faced the street so there was some noise and the room was fairly small, dingy and rather dated in a shabby kind of way rather than quaint. The TV was very small and looked about 20 years old with poor fuzzy reception and poor range of channels. I did not try the restaurant so cannot comment on this. On a positive note the hotel is in a great location which would be difficult to beat. In short the hotel is ok however it was not a tough decision to try another hotel and I would not stay at the Mayflower again unless my first choice (The Vintage Park) was not available.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR25610741">Stayed three nights, in a corner suite on the 12th floor. If you want restful sleep with little neighbor noise, this is the way to go. Because the suite literally was a corner of the hotel and my little living room was one on side of it, I had no bedroom walls that adjoined neighboring rooms. I know I had neighbors because I saw housekeeping cleaning their room, but I never once heard them. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff did NOT knock on my door at the crack of dawn, and they DID restock my little complimentary toiletries without me having to ask. I would absolutely stay here again, in the same suite. The restaurant, Andaluca, was wonderful. My only complaint there was that it was closed Monday AND Tuesday. Several minor little things...not much counter space in the bathroom, at all. And when they tell you room service is served 24 hours...that means you can get a fruit or deli plate any time. No hot food after 10. The windows only opened about three inches. Another hotel was being built fairly close by, and construction noise started around 0800 each day.

It is also the best priced hotel for this class of hotel in downtown. I use to live in Seattle and always walked by this hotel and would look in through the large window where the bar is located and would always want to go inside. It has a warm and inviting look to it and I was not one bit disspointed. First of all, the staff is excellent. From the valet that greets you when you drive up, to the front desk personnel, and the personnel that maintains the rooms, everyone is superb. The room was very nice with great beds and wonderful bed linens. The bathroom is a bit small but this is the price you pay for staying in an older hotel in the heart of downtown. The small bathroom was a small sacrifice considering the hotel has rooms with two queen size beds and is located on the same block as Westlake center and is only a few blocks to Pike Place Market. The rooms are also beautifully renovated and the property does not show its age. As I mentioned, you could not get a better location. It is located on the same block as Westlake Center. From here you can take the monorail to the Seattle Center. Nordstrom is only a block away and Pike Place is about three blocks away. I finally did go to the beautiful bar inside the hotel I use to look at years ago as I walked by and it was wonderful. They have some great drinks on the menu and you can order food here as well.

We were attracted to the property for its central location and moderate prices. Although we preferred other hotels on our 10-day trip, we were overall pleased with our stay at the Mayflower Park. For the rates we paid, it was a decent value for downtown Seattle. The location truly is the best selling feature of the hotel. We were able to easily walk to all the major downtown attractions, even the Space Needle. The attached mall with the monorail stop, was a great convenience. Pike Place is a short downhill jaunt and the fabulous Tom Douglas eateries are scattered throughout the area (Palace Kitchen and Dahlia Lounge/Bakery are not to be missed). The front desk was staffed by friendly, attentive service professionals. Check-in and check-out was smooth and efficient. We had a mixed experience with the doormen/bellmen/valet staff that lounge in the entrance. Doors were opened and held sporadically and conversations among the bellmen apparently took priority over guest service. Yes, the elevators are slow, but this was nothing we had a problem with. We had a king size corner room with couch and side chair seating area on the 9th floor. We had no issues with street noise, and enjoyed the view of the city. The room was a perfectly comfortable for two. The bed could have been a bit more plush. The mattress was just okay and could be due for replacement. The bathroom was a good size and was tucked around the corner, giving the room a nice layout and a break from cookie-cutter, chain hotels. I really admire the work that was done to save a preserve this historic property. However, the entire place needs a cosmetic freshening. The brass dÃ©cor and linens feel solidly late 80â€™s/early 90â€™s.

The monorail stop is really close. We were in a corner room on the 7th floor, and I thought it was a reasonable size. The bed was comfortable and the room had a good view of downtown Seattle streets. Furniture and overall decorating scheme were nice enough, but I think the carpet and bathrooms could use updating. The bathroom sink was nice, but the tub looked a bit ancient and not really in a cute historical way. However, the service was GREAT and everyone was nice. Valet parking was free, and when I realized I had forgotten a toothbrush, I was brought one (and toothpaste) within 5 minutes. Also, I didn't use it, but there was free wireless internet.

But the place does have its pluses and minuses. Positives- 1) Great service- as far as bellhops/valet, and housekeeping go. Getting the car was relatively quick, never a long wait (and supposedly the hotel was fully booked the time we were there) The room was always cleaned on a timely basis. One time we thought we lost our phone (after we had already come up the room) so the valet searched our car for us and even pulled our car up and helped us look for it again. 2) Location-Short walk to Pike Place Market and connected to the Westlake Center (monorail/stores/food court) 3) The king suite was spacious with a refrigerator and wet bar (convenient to bring back drinks since there is a Walgreens and Rite Aid about 2 blocks away), 2 tv's, and 2 thermostats (one for the bedroom and one for the sofa area) Negatives- 1) Noise level-note from the other rooms but from the street below (Our room sat right at the corner of Olive and 4th) I don't know how it is from the higher floors (the hotel is only 12 stories tall) but being on the lower floors you will defintely hear road noise from buses and cars (worse if you open the window). If you are a light sleeper make sure you ask for a high room. The noise didn't bother me but I didn't need an alarm in the morning with all the buses passing by. 2)No safe in the room-I though all hotels had one 3)Only 2 elevators-Not really a big deal, but they are slow and the staff also use the same elevators so at times you will wait (but again not too bad unless you're impatient) and the elevator are on the small side 4)Not stroller friendly-there are 2 entrances into the hotel one of which is a flight of like 10 steps (the main entrance)so you have to use the other entrance on the other side. And the connection to the Westlake Center is on the Mezzanine Level where you also have to go up about 15 stairs. (and again the elevator is small. 5)Less chance of getting a good view-Remember there are only 12 floors and I think you have to be on the upper floors if you want to see the water or Space Needle. Compared to the Westin across the street which is super tall and I'm sure you have a better chance of getting a better view (I'm not too much into views so I was okay with looking at the street) Overall I was very pleased with the room and the hotel and wouldn't mind staying here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7803760">Stayed at the Mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on June 5 and 6th. Advice to meeting planners: Think twice of having a meeting if over 70 participants will be at your function. The hotel was overwhelmed. Initially, the Plymouth Room, their largest conference room, which is under the lobby is attractive, but can only handle 8-9 tables of 8-10 people. Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane. As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont. While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet. Your car could be blocks away. Oh, by the way, they charge $28.00 a day.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7790972">We were a group of six staying for two nights before our Alaskan cruise. Our room was spacious but the bathroom was tiny (typical for older hotels). The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful but we were misinformed by the conceirge and bellman on more than one occassion. Our room was quiet but another couple traveling with us said their room was extremely noisy from the street traffic. We were on the same floor but around the corner from them. I didn't find the bed to be very comfortable as I've read in previous reviews. But I may be bias as I have a tempurpedic bed at home so it is difficult for me to find comfortable beds when traveling. The monorail station in the mall attached to the hotel is convenient but beware that it only travels to the space needle and back, there are no other stops. The restaurant attached to the hotel has great breakfast with excellent service. Seattle is a great city and I would love to travel there again. I might check out a different hotel just to have variety but I'd recommend this hotel to friends or family.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7266245">Wanting to take our 2 teenage kids to see another city, Seattle was next on our list. I decided to book 2 deluxe rooms at the Mayflower Park hotel based on its location and positive reviews here on Tripadvisor. We prefer to stay at hotels that have a local feel, rather than a corporate hotel. This hotel fit that bill. Our rooms were nicely furnished. My husband and I had a corner room (I specifically requested because the deluxe ones are slightly larger). On the 10th floor we had a fun view of the Macy's marquee out one window and the Seattle Space Needle out the other. Our kids shared a double queen that had 2 seperate bathrooms! and an amazing picture view ot the Needle. Having 2 bathrooms for the kids was a very pleasant surprise, because the bathrooms are not large. One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again. The hoitel is located right next to the Monorail to visit EMP and the Space Needle. We all enjoyed EMP. Views from the top of the Needle were gorgeous and we were able to see all the way to Canada and all of the surrounding snow covered mountains. The Mayflower Park is very well located to ALL of the major shopping and just a few blocks from Pikes Place Market and lots of great places to have dinner. We really enjoyed Etta's Seafood. It had a great Seattle vibe, and something for everyone. Our best breakfast was sharing a bag of just fried dounut holes from a vendor at Pikes Place Market and coffee. As I said before, I had few complaints. I do see room for improvement in two areas: better beds (they move ALOT when ever your partner moves) and larger bath towels would be nice. My husband and I had cocktails down at Oliver's in the lobby. Nice bar. We did have a forgettable breakfast at the hotel and did not return to eat any other meals there. Having access to free wireless in our room was nice, too. All considered it is a good, centrally located historic hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6844376">We spent four nights at the Mayflower in February 2007. We understand that the hotel was close to being torn down when it was rescued and completely renovated by a local group. It is now an independently-owned hotel in the style of upscale classic city hotels, entirely non-smoking and in the heart of downtown Seattle within several blocks of Pikeâ€™s Market. For those who shop, it is convenient to major chain stores (Macyâ€™s, Nordstrom etc), and opens directly from the lobby into Westlake Center (an indoor multi-story shopping mall). Room costs vary and one can find bargain rates via the internet as we did. Our room had two queen beds, a large desk with drawers for clothing, an armoire with TV above and more drawers below, a coffee maker (with regular and decaf coffee and tea provided). There was no mini-fridge â€“ though we did not ask to see if one might be provided on request. The bathroom had a tub/shower and single sink, with 3 sets of thick towels (for two people). The dÃ©cor was tasteful and attractive â€“ dark wood Chippendale-style furniture in excellent condition, tasteful carpeting and drapes. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I communicated with one concierge by email and phone and she responded quickly and fully to my questions about transportation from the airport. The concierge on duty during our stay responded to our queries with enthusiasm â€“ calling a place we asked about visiting to make sure they would be open, making dinner reservations on our behalf, recommending another excellent restaurant and suggesting a theatre performance that we thoroughly enjoyed. Transportation from the airport is available by taxi, shuttle, and Grayline hotel bus. The latter is by far the least expensive for one person traveling alone (less than half of the shuttle cost, and about a third of the taxi fare) but stops at the Westin Hotel which is a short 1.5 blocks from the Mayflower Park. The short walk is slightly uphill and is very easy with a small roll-on suitcase. The hotel has its own parking garage on site. The hotel has an attractive bar and a restaurant, but no souvenir or other shop. For toiletries and the like, there is a drugstore a half block away from the Mayflower Park. For other items, there is the small but well-stocked gourmet Ralphâ€™s Grocery &amp; Deli about two blocks away from the hotel on 4th Avenue. Ralphâ€™s has a good selection of local Washington state and other wines, cold beer, and makes sandwiches to order as well as selling other grocery items. The owner (Joe Cohen) is very knowledgeable and most helpful with choices of Washington state wine and port as well as other products in his store.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5526432">My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Mayflower Park in July 2006. I chose it for the very central location -- walking distance to the Pikes Market, Space Needle, ferry terminal, monorail, etc.; the price-point -- about $215/night plus tax; and the good reviews here and elsewhere. The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice. If you're like me, and favor modern accommodations, no opulent frllls, consistent quality, and a feeling you are a valued customer. . . you may end up deciding the Mayflower Park is a bit underwhelming.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5513540">Mayflower Park Hotel Review â€“ 6/30/06 â€“ 7/2/06 and 7/9/06 My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time earlier this month, in conjunction with a cruise to Alaska. We always try to stay at historic hotels if possible, instead of the cookie cutter big box hotels where you would be hard-pressed to know what city or state you were in. We read the reviews of the Mayflower Park Hotel on Trip Advisor, then found their website on the Internet. I was hesitant about staying here at first, after reading Trip Advisor reviews about the small rooms and bathrooms. When I called to get more information, I was told by reservations that the deluxe rooms were about 100 square feet larger then the classic rooms. I knew through my research that all hotel rooms in downtown were very expensive, and I was pleasantly surprised to be told that with an AAA or AARP discount of 30%, the rate for the deluxe room would be $179 instead of $255. I reserved a deluxe room with a queen bed for 2 nights prior to the cruise, and for 1 night after we returned. I then received an immediate confirmation by e-mail. The Mayflower Park was the best of all the places we have stayed in the Historic Hotels of America group. The restoration/renovation of the hotel is beautiful and everything about our stay was fabulous! We arrived from the airport shortly after noon, and were surprised to find our room ready for an early check-in. Check-in was a breeze and our luggage was quickly brought up to our room. Our room was beautiful and very large! Room 815, which was on the northwest corner, faces Macys to the west and had a view of the Space Needle to the north, although the flagpole atop of the flatiron building next door competed somewhat with the Space Needle view. We also had a small glimpse of the snow covered Cascades between the cityâ€™s high-rises. This corner room was bright with 3 sets of windows, very spacious and beautifully decorated. Queen bed, 2 bedside tables, armoire with television, 2 upholstered chairs with a table in-between, and a desk with chair in an extended area that also had a wet bar with granite countertop, a small under counter refrigerator and a coffee maker. The coffee packs that were furnished were without a doubt the best hotel room coffee I have ever had! Bathrobes, hair dryer, ironing board and iron were in the closet (small) and the bathroom was also somewhat small, but beautiful with a new pedestal sink, large tub and a great showerhead. The only drawback here was the close placement of the toilet between the tub and the door. Not much wiggle room there! The toiletries that were furnished were top of the line. When the bellman brought our luggage, he told us that the rooms that ended in the number 15 (815, 915, 1015, etc.) were all the same large corner rooms. The front desk called a couple of minutes later to ask if we needed anything, and the only thing I requested was to have the same room for the following Sunday night, after we returned from our cruise. We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go in the downtown area. Pike Place Market was just 3 blocks away. Seeâ€™s Candies was 1 block. We also walked to Pioneer Square, the Smith building, the new library and the ferry terminal to Bainbridge. We took a city bus up to the Seattle Center, and then walked up to Lake Union for the Wooden Boat show. Weather was gorgeous! Would I stay at the Mayflower Park again? You bet! Would I recommend it to others? Yes, most highly and without a doubt! Service (front desk, concierge, bellmen and housekeeping) was excellent. Location was great. Room 815 was wonderful. I canâ€™t wait until our next visit to Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4474756">My husband and I just got back from spending one evening at the Mayflower. It is a very beautifully decorated hotel. We arrived early and they held our bags for us and called us when our room was ready. When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running. Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room. The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size. So if you want to stay specifically in downtown Seattle then I agree the Mayflower is definitely a good location, but if you don't mind staying out a bit, try the Holiday Inn Downtown Everett!! Well worth it!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4405323">I am a little late posting had a great experience and had to share.

The room was so cute! A little small but nice. The bathroom had Aveda products which I thought was a nice touch. I highly recommend this hotel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125720270">I read thNe reviews, saw the location and price and decided that booking a room here was a good idea. My advice:don't do it people, just don't. Go for a brand name hotel, and pay a little more. That way, if something goes horribly wrong, you may have a shot at getting some kind of resolution. This is a true story, swear to God: my husband went to wipe himself off with a towel-twice while taking a shower and both of the towels had fe..s on them. Yes, fe..s. He flipped out and took the towels to the front desk. The manager was not there, and upon checking out, I explained to the girl at the front desk that not only was this appalling, but dangerous. Particularly to my one month old baby. I also told her, that I did not feel like I should pay for our stay there. I did pay though (Dumb. In retrospect, I should not have), because I just thought I would settle this with the manager later. My thought was the manager would listen to what happened to us, and act appropriately. That didn't happen. I emailed "Mike", the manager, then followed up with a phone call. He basically called m a liar, said that "never in my career have I ever heard of something like this", to which I replied, "Well I haven't heard of anything like this either in all my years of traveling, but this really did happen." He then proceeded to give me the third degree about where the towels were located, when this happened blah blah, etc. It was very apparent that he felt that this was some creative attempt on my family's part to get a refund. God, what a jerk. I am POed all over again just writing this. I asked for a refund, he said no, then I told him that I would need to file a complaint with the BBB. He then said, "Go ahead! I don't care, you can threaten me all you want!" Uh, no Mike this isn't personal, just horrendous customer service. Like, on very level imaginable. Whatever. I told him, fine. If this is the way you choose to handle this. I filed a complaint w/the BBB. come to think of it, I think I'll contact The Health Department too.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124832388">Stayed here for a concert next door. That is very convenient. The parking issue is a royal pain in the butt and I thought there must be internet or something in the lobby because it always seemed full in the morning (no internet elsewhere its just an old building) but discovered Sunday morning everyone was sitting around because the parking garage didn't open until 9am. Glad I didn't have to be anywhere! Booked months in advance and was in for a rude surprise then we checked out and they tried to charge significantly more than the agreed price. There is another place nearby with significantly more to offer for much less but I dig "historic". I don't dig surprises. Eventually the manager made good but it was after I got home. The restaurant next door turned the music up LOUD one night as if to tell my group GET OUT as soon as we sat down. That was fine, there's an Irish pub on the back side of the block (not the douchey one down by the market place) that had excellent food at excellent prices and the nicest staff we've ever encountered in downtown Seattle. If the other place hadn't chased us off we'd never have found the good place. The Moore doesn't even know what the word amenity means. What you get is a very clean room with a small TV and in our case a great view. There is nothing else, no fridge, coffee or microwave. The cleaning staff is terrific (cleaned our room twice one day which was funny and sweet). It was November so it was cold. There is no A/C and we don't think the heat ever came on in the 3 days we were there. Waking up at the crack of dawn and searching for breakfast was quite the adventure. The coffee shop next door (adjacent to the lobby) is terrific. The new owners are great. It kept the cloying damp at bay and prevented me from melting down when I discovered our car was being held hostage after we'd moved all our stuff downstairs and given up the room key. The theater next door is a great venue but the hotel was just ok.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124209876">I cant begin to do justice to our experience of staying here last month. Helpful, oddball staff left us wanting for nothing and tolerated our drunken late night ramblings like champs. We thank you, sincerely. The rooms were lovely, remodeled and finished with modern amenities that meshed well with the historic qualities of the hotel. Windows in the rooms actually open! We had a great view of the Puget Sound and Pike's Place was a just around the corner. Tons of Bars and Restaurants within a stones throw. Another thing we liked was that each floor had its own color scheme. One floor reminded us of a vampire brothel, if such a thing could exist. needless to say, we explored the entire Hotel, it was just that kind of place. We all agreed it felt haunted and the receptionist told us that many a creepy thing has gone down there over the years. Anyhow, beds were cozy, showers worked just fine. Room were clean. Ice machine worked as it should. I cant think of a single bad thing to say about our 2 night there.

It's only a couple of blocks away from main street of shop and wharf also a couple of block each way from the nicer restaurants.

The lack of air conditioning was a bit of a surprise but then I learned nearly all of Seattle doesn't have a/c, but they provided a fan. (IT was very warm the week we were there.)

I enjoy older hotels with some history, and thought the Moore Hotel was beautiful! It was very reasonable, especially considering the location. There were 4 of us sharing a room. The rooms were clean, had a nice view, and there was enough room for all of us. We were on the 6th floor, and didn't have a problem with the noise. The windows opened, and there was a small fan, which was fine for us, but if it was hot, the room would have been hot. Fortunately Seattle doesn't get that hot! The service was great...and we asked them quite a few questions about the area! They did everything that they could to answer our many questions!!! I was surprised by the complaints about the service, however, I believe that the way you treat people...comes back to you. There were so many options for eating within walking distance. I loved being so close to Pike Place Market!!! Had fun at the Nitelite bar next door too! It was a local bar feel, and he bartender was great!

However, it was loud if you stay in a room facing the street. We were on 7th floor and still could hear loud noises from the street throughout the night. Not only that, you can hear your neighbor's TV so the wall must be really thin. The room was okay, quite roomy and clean.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117723389">The Moore is definitely a good value. For a queen room with its own bathroom, the price was under $100 per night. Some of the rooms have shared bathrooms and these are even cheaper. The room was spacious and clean. There was not a lot of street noise but I could definitely hear doors slamming in the hallway (walls are pretty thin). I could easily walk to all of the major sites from the hotel: pike place market, seattle center, downtown shopping, and the ferry terminals. Late at night the area did feel a bit sketchy. It's not full service, so I had to go downstairs and get my own extra blanket. There was no climate control (air conditioning or heating) in my room so I had to open and close windows to be more comfortable. There is no coffee or tea in room, however the hotel just opened a coffee shop next door. I tried the espresso and it was really good! Also the shop has baked goods and muffins for breakfast. I would stay here again... but if you're fussy about certain things then this is not the hotel for you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117500588">I always find it a bit tough reviewing hotels of this class...no matter how good a 'deal' it is I can't give it better than an average rating since esthetically they are obviously challenged. So...IF you want a deal in one of the best locations in Seattle and don't care about esthetics (or air conditioning) then I'd highly recommend this place. I was there on one of the hottest weekends of the summer so the rooms was quite hot and stuffy without a/c but I know that's a non-issue for 80% of the rest of the year. I stayed in #210 which is right above the Dive Bar...not recommended. It was a massive room though and thank God we had our own bathroom! And they also kindly gave me a deal because of it's location - very nice of them. I hadn't realized when I booked that some rooms don't have their own bathrooms...you have to use the ones in the hallway. Again, personal preference I guess but that's a deal breaker for me. The room was clean, and that's the most important thing to me. But it's also very old and dated and we had a huge crack in the bathroom wall where part of the wall was literally peeling off. The lobby is very nice and also the only updated portion of the hotel and the front desk staff are some of the friendliest/most helpful I've met anywhere. Also, booking the reservation over the phone was a pleasure. The parking is a steal at $12/day a block away. Amazing location one block away from the market and 3 blocks from main shopping area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117322972">This is the sort of place I almost don't want to tell the rest of the world about.

The Moore is basically a 100 year old hotel that has been maintained nicely, but not redecorated to keep up with the fashions....it's all nice and clean - no fancy amenities, no bar fridges, no pool or hot-tubs, etc. Our plan was to park the car ( this part is a little tricky) walk to Pike's Place Market, have a great seafood meal (Cutter's - great but not cheap) hit the local pubs - a little jazz or blues....it all worked out perfecto! What we saved on the hotel paid for half the meal...the room had a great view (8th floor facing the ocean) no balcony but huge windows (that open - so careful with kids!!)

It is the best deal for downtown Seattle hotels, including the parking voucher which allows you to park in a garage a block away for $12 a day. The hotel doesn't have a lot in terms of "extras" like fitness rooms or breakfast, but it more than makes up for that in cost, location and friendly staff. We stayed in mid-August and never felt too hot in our room and we slept VERY comfortably. The Moore is just a quick walk to the Market, bus lines and other downtown attractions, and it has a lovely/super affordable Vietnamese restaurant (Long) right across the street if you find yourself hungry upon check-in!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117109410">I enjoyed my stay at the Moore Hotel. It is a very reasonably priced hotel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean, the individuals at the hotel lobby desk were friendly and helpful, and there was a computer available in the lobby to check e-mail and view the Internet. I was able to walk or take the numerous public transit options to view many of the attractions of interest to me in Seattle. Also, the hotel is only a 3-minute walk to the Central Link light rail, which for $2.75 can take you to the SeaTac airport. The negatives are that there is no breakfast, no fitness center, no writing desk in the room (so I ate my snacks/meals by the nightstand), and no air conditioning. The air conditioning was not an issue for me even for the week I stayed in August, as the Seattle weather was pleasant and cool and there was no need for air conditioning. It would have been helpful if the window had a screen as I minimized opening it due to my concerns that bugs would fly inside.

You know you're in a vintage lodging when they still give out actual metal room keys instead of a key card. There was noise from the street people out on the sidewalk, but at least it stopped by midnight or so. Tiniest, slowest elevator ever seen, get used to only using the stairs.

The fridge was replaced, but no apology made for the wasted food. The second issue was the WiFi. Nobody could access it. It requires a username and password. The ones supplied by the front desk were rejected. The manager came round and said the router was broken. After he appeared to have fixed it and left, the problem persisted. The third and most important issue was the desk clerk. His name is Robert and he quickly grows impatient when you report problems, blaming it on "the guest's equipment". I said that without WiFi I would need to check out, since I am on a business trip and need to access emails. His reply was "Awesome" and "Have a nice evening". After a long flight and business to conduct this is the last thing you need. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are looking for a hostel. The prices are modest, but the staff do not like dealing with problems with the room. I got the impression it is family run, with the desk staff being relatives who do not need to worry about complaints from guests.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116111505">We stayed at the Moore Hotel for one night at the end of July 2011. The hotel is ideally located just a couple of blocks from Pike's Market right in the center of downtown. The staff is very friendly and helpful so you tend to overlook some of the other shortcomings. The hotel is old, the elevator is old, the rooms are very basic with no coffee maker, no alarm clock, small older TV. There is quite some noise from the street if you open your windows. The bathroom is old with no vanity. Having said all of that, the rooms are very clean and they are non-smoking. The rates at this hotel are great and it is still a good value for the budget traveler.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115984903">I hated staying in this hotel. First of all, there's a very strange building next door which I think either houses the homeless or the crazy's. There was one lady at the front desk who was nice. Otherwise the guys behind the desk are rude, punk college kids. I had several run ins with their attitudes. Also on one particular day they were cleaning the windows; the guy propped up his squeegee which ended up falling over and hitting me.The walls are really thin and I had a room by the elevator so every time someone came on and off the floor I heard it. I would never stay here again, I chose to stay in this location because it was the only affordable thing around the convention center. However on the price vs. quality comparison, it was still a rip off.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115936796">My husband and I stayed at the Moore Hotel for three nights at the beginning of a two-week vacation. We enjoyed our stay immensely--the staff were very friendly, the bed was comfortable, the room was extremely clean, the hotel is well maintained and it is very close to Pike Market, shopping, the monorail, and the aquarium. We flew into Sea-Tac and took the Link Light Rail to Westlake Station, If I had any complaints at all it would be that there are no coffee makers in the rooms and there is no coffee in the lobby (but we got great coffee, hot tea, and crumpets at the Crumpet Shop in Pike Place Market every morning). Just a note: our room had a clawfoot tub shower, which might be difficult for some people to get in and out of. I cannot comment on parking because we waited until we were leaving Seattle to pick up a rental car.

No internet access though - the wireless signal is really weak and no wired internet. Room with shared bathroom We were reluctant - but it was all that was left on such short notice. The shared bathroom was fine, never had to queue to use it. Our room was still a good size and comfortable with an incredible view over Pike place and out to Puget Sound. No internet.

Central in terms of downtown Seattle, and two blocks from Pike Place, which is a good starting place for anybody coming to Seattle. The room itself reflects the price you pay--not fantastic, but relatively clean and comfortable. The major problems I had were that the water temperature wasn't regulated at all--I was scalded and frozen within seconds of stepping in the shower. It was also a very small shower, which was manageable, but tough to shave in. The people at the front desk are mostly fun, but the wireless is awful everywhere except the lobby.

It is a historic hotel but it is well-maintained with nice furniture, good carpets and freshly painted rooms. If you're looking for a luxury hotel this isn't it, however. There's no pool, only one small mirror in the bathroom, you have to park in a parkade across the street, there's no kleenex, hair dryers (maybe if you ask at the desk), wifi in the rooms or alarm clocks. Also, the homeless shelter is on the same block. It's a busy area however, so I never felt unsafe walking around with my two kids. If you value cozy charm, value, and location over luxury, make sure you stay at the Moore!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115249114">I was able to book a last minute stay here over 4th of July weekend. The first thing I noticed about the place was how nicely decorated and clean the hallways were. The room I stayed in, on the other hand, was a lot plainer--though clean and comfortable. Staff was helpful, friendly, and accommodating. You have free internet and wifi use in the lobby, too. CONS: 1) Having to wait to use the shower. You pay a low price for the hotel because bathrooms are not en suite. I think one morning, I waited about 2 hours to be able to shower, even walking downstairs to check other floors. The bathrooms could have been a tiny bit cleaner, too, but it wasn't bad considering how many people use them. 2) No free parking. You get a discount, though, in a lot near them. It can add up, at $12 a day. Or, you can park at the meters after 6 for free ($4/2 hours before 6pm) and move the car at 8 am. Overall a really nice hotel in a great location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115122774">We stayed in one of the suites of The Moore hotel during last June, and I must say it's the best I've ever experienced in Seattle. The room was spacious, and so was the bathroom, there was also a living area that could have been more comfortable, but was good enough for us, with a kitchenette and a dining table. The decoration was simple, modern and very nice, combined with some old features, such as the radiators. And it's true that they fold the towels in animal shapes. We had a dog (although my husband believes it was a rabbit... whatever... it was puppy, believe me :P). The location is perfect to go out at night, to go shopping during the day, and itÂ´s only a couple of blocks away from the seafront and the market, and a short walk to the EMP, International fountain, Space needle, etc. The parking is a block away, and it's 12$/night. You can request a card in the hotel to request in/out privileges. BUT! it closes at midnight and opens again at 7, so if you're going to be late at night, you better take a cab to avoid having to park on the street. Back to the hotel, the staff was very helpful and friendly at all times. The only rude person we met was the bartender of the bar next to the hotel, but we're unsure whether it belongs to The Moore or not.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR112484256">This could be a charming stop in Seattle: the location is outstanding, and the period building with wooden doors and real keys took us back to the 30's.

Everything was clean. The room was a little plain, but it had everything I needed. The staff was very helpful to me. They do not have free parking, however, if you do have a car, they offer discounted parking at a secure location one block down the street.

My wife and I got into town to catch a show in town we had tickets for. When we first arrived at the hotel and got into our room I sensed that this place was trouble but since it seemed quiet - 6pm at the time - and we drove all day to get to Seattle; we decided to try it out and get some rest. We went to bed at about 9pm because we were exhausted but did not get much sleep because we were awaken by the neighbor's blasting there music and drinking and yelling at about 9:30pm. The walls are paper thin so you can hear every word the people in the next room were saying - or should I say yelling. It sounded like there was 20 people in the room all talking at the same time and drunk and loud. The real insanity started at about 1am when a couple of men started arguing loudly and began threatening each other. They then began to fight in an obvious physical brawl that carried out into the hall, complete with screaming girlfriends and death threats the sounds of a bottles breaking in the room while the brawl continued out in the hall. The fight eventually de-escalated but now the drunks decided to 'talk about it' out in the hall in front of our door. The people who were still in the room decided to put on gangster rap music full blast until approx. 6 am before it stopped. My wife and I did not sleep a wink the whole night and the next morning when we approached the girl behind the desk and explain to her why we not be returning the next night - or ever for that matter - she said she is used to dealing with drunks in the halls and really enjoys yelling at them when that sort of thing happens there. The insinuation was obvious - this type of activity is not uncommon at this hotel. THIS PLACE IS A DUMP AND A DRUNKEN FLOPHOUSE!!

I love the Pike Place Market and you can't get any closer for under $100 a night. And they validate parking so it was only $12 for almost 24 hours. The hotel is of course OLD but we like the way it has been renovated and the features such as windows that open. It was great to be so close to the market. We had a great dinner at the Virginia Inn, breakfast at Baaco's, and lunch at Lowell's in the Market. We noticed lots of young people and Europeans and other foreigners at the Moore. It definitely is not typical but so worth the price for the location. We would stay there again. There is a wonderful small Catholic church next door also. A really interesting neighborhood.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR82881825">I chose to stay at the Moore Hotel with my friend as it was in a great location and very reasonable in price. It's so close to Pike Place Market, the shops in downtown Seattle, and the exit to the Light Rail. If you arrive late in Seattle and need a place to eat, the guy at the front desk said the only place open is "Night Kitchen" and it was a nice place to eat. The only real downside of this hotel is that it's sooooo quiet. Some people like quiet rooms, but I found it very hard to sleep at night because I could hear my every movement. My friend and I would see many people in the lobby each day and at night, it was dead silent. I think part of this has something to do with the fact that they do not have an air conditioning system, which we didn't really need, but I think the white noise from the AC would have allowed me to sleep better. The beds were pretty comfortable. Also, there was no hair dryer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR81764226">Arrived at our reserved hotel, The Moore, on our first night in Seattle. Right off, we had a car, so parking might have been an issue, but we always parked after 9 at night and were gone before 8 am, so on street parking was free. Otherwise there was a $12 all day parking lot very close by. We were traveling with my sister and her daughter. They were staying at the plush Sheraton for a conference. Since we were not going to be in the room alot, we didn't want to pay the $360 per night that the Sheraton was asking. Hence, we booked a room at The Moore. After dropping off my sister and her daughter at the Sheraton and seeing their plush room, coming to the Moore was shocking. It is an older type hotel - like something you'd find in an older section of Europe. when we checked in at 10:30 p.m., the lobby was dimly lit, but I did notice beautiful furniture and artwork. Also, there was a disco next door of some sort with loud music. I was just beside myself. Then we took the elevator up to the top floor for our room - again, when I switched on the lite I was grimacing. It was your very basic room. I quickly realized that it was "dim" because they were using CFL lightbulbs (good for them!), so it quickly got much brighter. The first night I didn't know what to expect, but we were there for four nights so I was going to make the best of it. It quickly grew on us and by the end of our stay, I downright liked it. The walls were tastefully painted, it was clean, although old. The bathroom was very clean and spacious. It had a great view out the window. It was not hot or stuffy. The exterior hallways had nice artwork and were clean. And every night when we came back to our room, we couldn't wait to see what new animal shape the maid had created out of our towels and left them artfully on our very comfy bed. Yes, maid service! My sister didn't even get that at the Sheraton!. So, even though a bit shocking start, we really liked this hotel, the location was fabulous (although it is in a so-so neighborhood, so caution is in order), parking was easy and everything turned out fine. Can't beath the price in downtown Seattle and I'm sure we could have done a lot worse.

We are travelling the USA, and admittedly have been staying in cheap hotels and hostels. While our expectations are pretty low when it comes to accomodation, this hotel really disappointed us. When we arrived, the man who checked us in was extremely rude. Didn't even say hello, and when we questioned why he was printing a receipt from the credit card machine with our credit card details when we weren't paying for our room until check out, he got extremely defensive and uppity. Later on, we spoke to another, younger guy at reception, who was also incredibly rude and was saying very explicit swear words, even to older guests. This was so unprofessional to us. Our room was basic, the bed wasn't particularly comfortable but everything was generally clean. After we checked in at reception, we went upstairs to our room and, after trying to enter, we discovered a man was in our room watching TV. what the hell? was our reaction. I think he worked at the hotel, but again, unprofessional. The next day, a guy at reception gave us the wrong directions to the airport...good job we checked it with somebody else or we would have missed our flight. The shared bathroom was dirty and the toilet was blocked for a period of about 8 hours (it was blocked in the morning when my boyfriend had a shower, and was still blocked by the evening when i showered). Luckily we had a toilet and sink in our room. The only good point about this hotel was the free to use computer in the lobby with fast internet. Then again, that is expected these days with hotels. The location was okay, but it didn't feel particularly safe despite being in the centre of the city. Overall, we did not enjoy our time here.

I planned on a hostel, but they were full so they referred me to Moore Hotel. I paid around $60 a night, which is about half of what you would pay for any other hotel downtown. Although the building is old, it was clean and very safe. The desk is attended 24 hours a day, and the doorway between the lobby and the stairs/hallway is locked at night. The room, though Spartan, was comfortable. I appreciated the small touches, such as the towels folded into animals. I chose a European Style room, which means there is a sink in the room but the toilet and shower are down the hall. The hall bathrooms were kept very clean. I never had to wait to use them, so the arrangement wasn't as inconvenient as I thought it would be. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about restaurants, shopping, and must-see attractions in Seattle. Location was ideal. Everything I wanted to see was in walking distance. For example, it is just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. However, down the block from the hotel was a drug rehab-salvation-army-type shelter place, where support groups met. So, if you are intimidated by people that do not look wealthy or middle class, may sometimes be dirty or wear odd clothing, walking past this place may be a bit intimidating for you. I was a little intimidated (I'm from a rich suburb), but I never felt as if I was in danger. This is important, as I am a woman who was traveling alone.

It has both good and bad features. The accommodations are Spartan but clean and spacious. The location is great except for the drug and alcohol recovery center next door, which results in individuals of questionable character loitering on the street day and night. (These folks can be avoided by walking on 3rd St. or on the west side of 2nd St.) We appreciated the kitchenette, but had to request a microwave, which was provided. There were very few cooking utensils, but nice tableware. There were no knobs on the cooktop, and none could be found by the staff. Electrical wiring was stapled to the walls, and there was no clock or clock radio. We were on the street side, 2nd floor, and there was considerable street noise (much of it from the rehab folks next door.) Free wi-fi worked well. Would we stay here again? Probably. If you limit your expectations, the Moore provides acceptable, spacious, but spartan accommodations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR32717306">This hotel is old and has the charm that goes with that. It is well maintained and improved but not extensively renovated. We liked the desk clerk who recommended a great restaurant for us and we liked the location of the hotel. Ww could walk to the restaurant and bar area around Pike Market and also to the seafront. We had a one night stay and found the hotel completely adequate for our needs. We'd recommend it for a budget stay in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR32324385">I was spending a few days sightseeing in Seattle prior to travelling up to Vancouver for an Alaska cruise. I chose this hotel based on location and price. I will admit to being a little nervous as we pulled up in front of the hotel - it's definitely nothing to look at - but the lobby had an old-time charm to it, and the staff were warm, friendly, and helpful. I was given a verbal description of three available rooms and allowed to choose: one with a clawfoot bathtub, one on a newly remodeled floor, and one with a view of the water. I chose the waterview, which was on the seventh floor facing Second Ave. And received, to my great surprise, an actual KEY - not the key card you get at all the chain hotels. You can see the water over the tops of the other buildings. The room was quite large, with a very high ceiling and two big windows that you can open - which is a good thing, because there is no air conditioning, and the weather during my stay was sunny and warm. There was a small tabletop fan, which was a huge help both in cooling down the room and in providing white noise to counter the traffic in the street below. Very plain decor, institutional-looking bedspread and drapes. Nice little table near the windows, but the chairs seemed low when using them with the table. The bathroom was small, and it puzzled me. In the space where a bathtub would normally be, there was a shower stall. There were walls on both sides of it, which made the space next to the toilet uncomfortably small. And that shower was extremely temperamental temperature-wise - it would not maintain a constant temperature. All that being said, however, the hotel was clean and just a short walk from Pike Place Market and Westlake Center (and the monorail). When you input the address shown here on TripAdvisor, it doesn't line up with what I found in reality; it's on Second Ave between Virginia and Stewart, right next door to the Moore Theatre, which did not have any events during my stay. This puts it on the same block, practically next door to some kind of housing called the Josephinium, a "Recovery Cafe" and what appears to be a group of social service agencies. So there were some interesting characters hanging out in front of those buildings - but they were not of the type who accosted passersby. The public transportation buses are free within a downtown zone which includes the Moore Hotel. A cab down to the Amtrak station cost, as I recall, about $12. This was nothing fancy, but all I needed was a place to sleep when I wasn't rambling around, so it suited me just fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30482472">Stayed with my husband and two teenage daughters in March. We did face the bay and I was happy that we could open the windows. Downside very loud on the weekends with ppl coming out of the clubs with drunken yelling. I'm sure earplugs would work, but didn't notice any noise from other guests. I liked our rooms with their high ceilings. we had two rooms that were adjoined by a bathroom. Each room had its own closet and TV. The kids room had 2 twin beds and an extra sink and mirror. All this for about 130.00 per night. We also had a microwave and frig. Very clean room, heat with radiator. Desk staff was adequate, not overly nice but not rude either. We had fun here, a little dicey neighborhood at night but I walked along and felt safe, but I live in a big city so I'm used to panhandlers and street ppl, but if your from a small town or the country this might not be the place for you. Only bad thing I could see was there was no A/C so a hot night/day in the summer might be very uncomfortable but perfect fall through spring. Walked everyday to Pikes place also walked to space needle just a mile or so, very close to lots of shopping and restaurants.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR27586997">I joined TA recently so my stay at The Moore is not that recent but I'm so surprised by all of the positive reviews that I felt like I should detail our experience just for an alternate viewpoint. We had so many issues during our stay it's hard to know where to start. We spent 2 nights in October of 2007 and it was quite chilly but there was no heat in our room. The front desk person told us that it came on automatically at a certain time but it never came on at all for us. The sheets were thin and barely large enough for the bed so they slid off the corners all night. There was a closet but not one hanger to be found. The elevator was so small that if you had luggage you had to wait until there was no one else using it in order to have enough room to bring up your things. But the absolute worst part for us was that there were concerts going on next door both nights and the noise level was so intense that it literally rattled our walls until well after 11pm each night. I will agree that it was a great rate for the location but in future I would definitely pay more for a more comfortable room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26657207">This was my first time going to Seattle and I didn't really know how things were situated downtown. However, after going there and staying in two different hotels just a few blocks from each other, I can say that the Moore is the best deal. It's literally 2 blocks from Pike Place Market. The rooms are bare and old, yes, but very clean. The cleaning staff even makes towel animals like they do on cruise ships - a small but thoughtful gesture for a minimally staffed hotel. My only "complaint" is that the bathroom is VERY small, which wasn't a problem for me but if you're claustrophobic I would not stay here. Things I didn't know before staying there: the hotel offers free Wi-Fi in the lobby though it's not advertised so you should ask the receptionist. In addition, it is a historic hotel and is next to The Moore Theater. Both of which were featured in a little walking food tour we did, so be sure to check out the theater, I hear it's beautiful on the inside! Bottom line: If you don't care too much about hotel amenities and are just traveling to explore the city, then the Moore provides a perfect place to sleep and have easy access to downtown Seattle. Parking is definitely an issue though, so if you are traveling with a car I'd look into another hotel that offers parking.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25674255">The Moore is an old hotel with a good city location, for a budget price. We stayed a couple nights over the summer and found it to be okay, if not great. Our room seemed reasonably clean, but the furnishings and facilties are clearly old. By old, I don't mean 1980's old - the hotel was built in 1907. That said, we had reasonable expecations and we were comfortable enough. The view of the Space Needle from the fire escape was also pretty amazing. Whether you enjoy the Moore or not depends mostly on you. If you're used to cheap places with a backpacker / hostel feel, you'll fit right in at the Moore. If you generally choose the Hyatt, you should probably avoid it. I would also avoid the Moore if I were extremely safety-conscious. This is not the building I would want to be sleeping in during an earthquake or a fire. Our biggest inconvenience was parking. We were in town for a couple weeks and had a car and a lot of stuff. We ended up paying a fairly hefty rate to stay at a skeevy parking garage down the street. By the time we wrestled the luggage up and down a (very dodgy) parking garage stairwell a few times, I started to suspect we might have been better off staying somewhere else. Bottom line, if you're travelling light and cheap and want a good downtown location, the Moore is probably a good choice. If you have a car to park, or a lot of luggage, or you tend to like newer places, get on Priceline or Hotwire and check out their deals on chain hotels. You can probably stay at a Hilton or Marriot property for about the same money as the Moore using this technique.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25523121">Great location and good price.

Great view and could just see part of the Public Market neon sign. Everything downtown in easy walking distance, or the free bus zone. The nicest desk clerks who speak well of management and are more than willing to pass on their considerable knowledge about taxis, restaurants, shopping. I was even offered an umbrella for predicted rain. Sizable room and closet, hot water, quiet, clean. This year's surprise, the hand towel/washcloth folded swan has been joined by a bathmat/washcloth elephant. This could be an old European hotel.

We were visiting Seattle on a busy weekend, so rooms were a little hard to find. We took a chance on the Moore after reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were glad we did. The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of downtown attractions, especially Pike's Place Market. In fact, if you stay at the Moore, don't even think about renting a car. Parking is too much of a hassle to worry about, and walking is just too easy. There are a couple of things that were not great about the hotel: The immediate surroundings are more sketchy than some of the more touristy areas. Also, the rooms are not air conditioned- which is only a problem because this part of downtown has plenty of bars that can be loud with an open window.

This place was mentioned in my Lonely Planet guide, and got good reviews on here, so my friend and I stayed there 2 seperate nights in September. For about $110 US a night, this place was an excellent choice. The staff were laid-back but pleasant and helpful. The neighbourhood wasn't too rough, and it's very handy to all the major attractions of Seattle, especially Pike Place markets. The room was simple yet excellent. We had two double beds and a private bathroom (you can go without a bathroom in your room, and use a shared bathroom for less $) The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean, the beds comfortable and immaculate. The room was also spacious and you could open the windows a little to let in fresh air. One of the most lovely things about the hotel was the presentation of the bathrooms. The towels were plentiful and were folded into fan shapes- a really nice touch! Only one drawback- it's a older building, so there was no air conditioning in the room (though a powerful desk fan was provided.) If you're one to suffer the heat, be advised, it could get quite stuffy in summer. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if you're on a bit of a budget.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21139938">Since I arrived at the Moore at 2 am I didn't expect a great welcome but the front desk person was expecting me and even warned about the street noise in the morning ( which was nothing much if you live in a city).

The bathroom is very old ( i would say 60 years)...but the shower fixture is new...unfortunately made a very large crack in the tiles and left 2 cemented holes where the taps were.

We thought the hotel was a pretty good deal. It's easy to get to from SEA-TAC airport. Just take bus 194 and walk the 2 blocks to the hotel. Could not be easier or cheaper at $1.50 one way. The location is great. You are close to Pikes Public Market and downtown Seattle is well within walking distance. However, its location is also the only disadvantage we noted. 2nd Avenue is a pretty busy one way street leading into the downtown area. With the windows open at night, the police car sirens were pretty noticeable as well as pretty frequent. But that is a small price to pay for staying at the Moore. The hotel itself shows character. It is clean and housekeeping was great. The room was large and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom we had was private and had recently been remodeled. No complaints at all. The desk crew was very friendly and helpful. There is a room where you can securely leave your luggage on your last day after checkout for that one last jaunt to the market. All in all we would stay at the Moore again.

Family of four, with two teenaged children. We had a suite both times, two rooms with a bathroom in the middle for $121. Can't beat it. We were on the 3rd floor the first time, 6th floor the second time. Both floors were updated. It is an older building, but there was fresh paint, it was clean and we even a a towel elephant in the bathroom! TV and fridge in the room, internet in the lobby. Two blocks from the fish market, about 1/2 mile from Whole Foods. The desk clerks were great, helpful and stored our luggage after we checked out. Buses are free, so we were able to get around easily. Seattle has some interesting characters, I don't think they are limited to the Moore hotel area. There seemed to be a lot of tattoed, body pierced folks and homeless people. We are from the Philadelphia area, so this was not so unusual for us, but I can see how some people might be afraid. We had to go to the drugstore in the evening, and we felt safe. One regret is that we did not have a room away from the street. Apparently, the suites all face the street. I did hear the street noise at night, and that woke me. But, the rest of my family was not bothered by it. Otherwise, it was a nice place to stay on a budget.

We stayed at Marriott properties in the first two cities, and we knew the Moore was a different type of hotel, but we loved the location and the price. For $95 nightly, we had a very basic suite-type room that had been converted from two separate rooms - one with a private bath and one with only a sink. As requested, our room was on the back side of the hotel away from the street, so it was very quiet, other than some banging of doors in the morning as other guests came and went down the hallway. There is no a/c, but this was not an issue as the late July daytime temps never got above 70 degrees during our stay. Our bathroom was nice-sized, with a claw-footed tub/shower combination with good water pressure. Water pressure in the bathroom sink was a little weak. Arriving on the last ferry from Victoria, we checked in after 10 p.m. The clerk who helped us that night, Bob, was very accomodating and even provided us with three different options for dining that would be open late. The next day he helped us with recommendations for more dining options in Capitol Hill. He was very patient and thorough each time we came to him with more questions. If you need luxury, you'd be much more comfortable in one of the $250+ hotel rooms in the nearby chain hotels. If you're looking for a basic room for a great price, the Moore's a good option.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18510042">My husband and I were on a 12-day trip to Los Angeles, Seattle and untimately San Francisco. We spent 3 nights in Seattle at the Moore Hotel. I have to admit, I am cheap when it comes to paying for lodging, especially if it's only to sleep (and not taking advantages of any amenities), which this one was. But, on the other hand, you do get what you pay for. We were on the 5th floor. It seemed that they were slowly remodeling the hotel because the 3rd floor seemed newly painted and had nice light fixtures in the halls (though didn't see the rooms) , as opposed to our floor that was dingy and creepy, kind of like the place in The Shining. The room was basically that. A decent sized room with a dresser, TV, nightstand with phone and bed. There was no desk or chair. There was nowhere to sit except on the bed. The walk-in closet was nearly as big as the room but that was a non issue for us. No A/C but a small fan on top of the TV. We didn't need AC as the weather was cool in late July. BUT the downside to that was that you had to open your windows.... (not a place for small children as there weren't even screens) to get a breeze. That made for a terribly loud night's sleep. The carpet was creepy (not necessarily dirty, but dingy) and I kept shoes on my feet at all times. The bathroom was the pits. It was old and you had to step up about 18" into THE smallest shower I've ever seen. The thing that killed me and I'm not sure why but the toilet didn't have a cover. Just a seat. Like you're using the bathroom at a rest stop. Since the bathroom was so small, there was no place to put your toiletries and I was afraid that anything I precariously perched on the edge of the sink was going to fall into the toilet. I carried on a lot about the toilet not having a cover and I think my husband got tired of listening to me but I just found it really strange! (We stayed in a Quality Inn in Los Angeles for less than Moore Hotel and the QI had coffee makers in the room AND continental breakfast (and FREE parking) and was way nicer than Moore.) The positive of the place is that the location is BONUS and the rate is fair, keeping in mund what you get for that rate. It's about 3 blocks from Pike's Market which is central. We walked to the space needle and I'd say it was a good mile's walk, but definitely do-able. There's coffee about a block in either direction, but you still have to LEAVE the building. Another minor benefit was internet access in the lobby but even though they post a 15 min time limit, it was in use all the time. I probably wouldn't stay here again. I've never stayed in a hostel, but this place is what I think a hostel would be like. I'm too old for that!! If you're young and/or don't care a bit about amenities this place is fine to sleep, though the bed was cheap and semi-comfortable. This place epitomizes the phrase "You get what you pay for".

I generally find the reviews helpful, and thus thought all the good reviews for the Moore Hotel were an indication of a potentially positive experience and I really looked forward to it. On the contrary, it turned out to be a very short and bitter experience. Okay, it's low cost, and in the end, you get what you pay for. But it just does not deserve all the positive reviews... The one and only elevator broke down (not the first time according to another guest), so that was a struggle for someone at the 6th trying to bring luggage up or down. No airconditioning, but instead a small fan was provided to help the guest battle the July Seattle heat. The telephone was poor quality and one could hardly hear the other line. Parking was a block away, meaning one would have to walk a block back to the hotel even late at night in a neighborhood of old buildings, homelesss and lower-end nightclubs. The window pane in our daughters' room was broken and was open and difficult to close. The allegedly excellent staff were not very helpful. When my daughter complained about the broken lift, the comment was there were a million and a half other things to do. A sketch to tell me where the secure parking area was located was inaccurate and I had to drive around several times before finding it. One chap behind the counter was completely useless, just giving me a blank stare whenever I asked a question. He was the one who drew the inaccurate map to the parking lot. When we complained about the broken window, we were told that there was no risk since the window could not be opened (which was not true) and and anyway the hotel would not offer that room if it were not safe. We stayed all of one hour. We booked two rooms, but we only occupied one room while deciding whether to stay or move elsewhere. When we finally decided to move, they insisted that I pay for the full night for both rooms, even if we didn't touch the other one (we did go in and have a look). I had no choice but to pay, otherwise they would just charge my credit card. They gave me a statement but no receipt, and had absolutely no sympathy for our situation, insisting that this was a business and that their policy was what it was. After this experience, I will now have to check twice as long and hard at the reviews to make sure I won't get fooled again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17790580">We needed a place to spend the night on our return to the states from Canada as our flight left in the am.

I stayed in the room without a bathroom (it just had a sink) on the 5th floor with a view of the sound (with a foreground view of a rooftop carpark!) I found the room big and clean, the bed comfortable and the tv had a zillion channels! It was a tiny bit annoying that the wifi doesn't really work in the rooms, but it can be accessed in the lobby. The shared bathrooms were cleaned everyday and didn't smell bad. The floor I stayed on was not a renovated floor - so be sure to ask for a renovated room. The hotel is old, so the hallways are a bit dark and overall the hotel doesn't look like a new modern/contemporary hotel.

Also in a good spot for nightlife and funky restaurants. I checked in late the first night, and the staff was very accomodating. My room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable and I had a great view of Elliot Bay out my window (7th floor). Although I was right near the elevator, I could only hear minimal noise. No shampoo or conditioner, but ehn, I brought my own anyway. I just parked on the street, which is free from 6pm to 8am. At 8 I came out and paid the parking meter. $3 for 2 hours. Then I picked up my friend from the airport and we drove to Vancouver. We returned to Seattle for our final night, and our stay was slightly less great. Our room was still nice, freshly painted and clean, but the faucet for the shower was falling off and very difficult to use. The night staff on this night was also not very friendly. I interrupted a 20 minute conversation between the desk agent and a guest for some information (I was using the guest computer, while I waited) . The clerk was very unhappy, although the guest seemed relieved. It was great to have a guest computer, but a printer (for a boarding pass) would have been very welcome.

I have always requested the European Rooms (Shared Batchroom) because they are even less expensive and I have always got what I expected, a Clean bed and a no-frills room. The shared bathrooms are clean if you get up early, but wait until after 9am and its bit messy. My only recomendation is that you request a room on the backside (alley) or a top floor room, as the street will get a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights. As for the neighborhood, it's no less or more safe after dark than any other downtown location. It is also close to Pike Market.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10984870">We're from South Africa and stayed here for a night before cruising to Alaska. OK, on the positive side, the rooms were large, staff friendly, and we got an early check-in. Plus it really was cheap. It was clean, and one could easily walk down to Pike Market- about 4 or 5 blocks. So pretty convenient for one night. On the downside I have to say it really is very basic. Bed and Tv, that's it. And the surrounding area shuts down real early as there's nothing around it. So to get a bite you'd better leave early or alternatively be prepared to travel! But for a single night? Just fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10612084">We were looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and found this to be the perfect choice. Although it is not especially plush the Moore Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful. If you want to see all that Seattle has to offer you cannot be in a better location - two blocks from Pike Street Market with Macys and other major stores 2 blocks in the other direction. The 'tour bus' stop is just a 2 minute walk away which takes you all around Seattle and stops at all the major attractions.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10017368">I stayed here for 2 nights in a single room with shared bath. The room had a sink with mirror, small TV, small fan and large closet. The building is old and the rooms have seen better days, especially the carpets. The bed sheets were scratchy - no Egyptian cotton here! Shared baths were clean. Bottles of cold water could be purchased anytime for $1 at the reception. Staff were friendly and helpful. The sliding lock on my door was broken, but I could lock the doorknob with my key. My room overlooked the street at the front of the building and the traffic noise was bothersome, especially the night of the Torchlight Parade for Seafair. The fan helped that a little. The second night, there were people talking loudly and walking around all night and their voices echoed in the halls. It sounds a little miserable, but it's no different than a youth hostel. The location can't be beat, so if you need a cheap place to crash downtown, this place is good enough.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10007391">I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems. I always book in advance and pay with my credit card. Last time they asked for my drivers license. With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down. The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room. I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID and My group went there instead. I reported them to Visa.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10003037">We stayed at the Moore for 2 nights prior to our Alaska cruise trip. The Moore locates in a very good location. You can walk to the pier, pike place market and downtown area easily. I went jogging along the waterfront and to the nice park and enjoyed it. We walk to our NCL Pearl at Pier 66 to board our ship and it is a nice walk downhill. So, location is excellent for the price. The hotel is not fancy but clean. We spend a little more to have our own bathroom, instead of sharing, which is worth the money. There is a small TV, but no refrigerator or drink. But, that is not a problem because you can walk to buy all the stuff you want nearby. This hotel is good for budget traveller who wants to stay near downtown area. By the way, we have a great time in Alaska and NCL pearl is fanstastic.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8885557">As a single young woman traveling alone, I was a little wary as to what the hotel/surrounding area would be like. But the Moore Hotel felt safe and in a great location for the price I paid. The only time I really felt scared is when I arrived at 3am due to a delayed flight. and had to walk a couple blocks to the motel from the bus stop. (I know, not the best situation for any area of any big city) No one gave me problems, but just be aware that it might not feel completely safe walking in the area alone late at night. The motel is just a short walk from the Pike Place Market and bus routes to other places. I even walked to the Space Needle from the hotel, but it is was quite a long walk. I was most impressed with the housekeeping staff! They deep cleaned my room between the nights of my stay. They also have origami washclothes/towels every day. I chose to share a bathroom ("European style") to keep things cheaper. The bathrooms were clean, but other hotel guests frequently had left their towels laying around and a hair or two in the tub. That didn't bother me, but it may bother some people. If you showered first in the morning, you'd have a completely clean shared bathroom.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8840358">We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle, and we certainly got that. We got one of the suites on the 4th floor, and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky). It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet. Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite. Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms. It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom! It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college. On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe. It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd. When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in. I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8751868">Everything was perfect.

We paid $66 plus taxes a night for a double room with no bathroom. This was during what is still considered â€œhighâ€� season in Seattle (Seattle being what I consider to be an expensive hotel city, but I digress). Look, The Moore isnâ€™t fancy, but for $66 what are you expecting? Our room was on the 7th floor. It was small, but CLEAN and I felt SAFE which is all that matters, to me at least. The bathroom and showers were just down the hall, but I never encountered any one when I went to use them. The staff are very helpful and kind. Yes, there is some noise from the street and The Moore theatre below if there is a concert going on. As for the â€˜streetâ€™ people, theyâ€™re harmless and left us alone, which was refreshing (considering weâ€™re from Vancouver where you can encounter aggressive panhandling) and I felt pretty safe in the area. The Night Lite lounge was great for a quick drink, $3 beers cant go wrong!. Great location, 2 block to pike place market, 2 block to GREAT shopping in the Pine Street area. The hotel is also in the middle of the â€˜freeâ€™ zone for busses, which makes it pretty cheap to zip around down town. We were so busy out seeing Seattle we didnâ€™t spend much time at the hotel, except to sleep. Ask for a room higher up, youâ€™ll encounter less noise.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8697237">This hotel is about 3 blocks from Pike's Street Market and 11 blocks from Amtrak station.

Problems: It's really old and needs renovation, there is no air condition, there are street people hanging outside the door, there is no parking for the hotel, parking behind hotel is $7 for 2 hours, there are night clubs opened most of the night so you get entertained wheither you want to or not, you can't close the windows because there is no a/c, some of the windows are at fire escape so you don't want to leave them open, and last but not least, the mirror in the bathroom opens to the outside.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8518801">Absolutely great hotel! When I saw the outside I thought it might be a bit run down but I found no problems. It is a little dated looking but I thought everything was fine. The 2 guys on reception were really helpful with tips of where to go and were really friendly. There is free internet in reception for hotel guests although it can get a little busy at times....guests are asked to limit to 15mins a go. The room I had was on the top floor (7th - I had asked for a quiet room). It was large, roomy, clean and great views of the Olympia mountains! The bathroom was clean and even had origami towels. Had a bath/shower so you could chose and a fridge too. There is only 1 lift and it is a bit old and small but it never broke down or anything when I was there. The area is not the greatest but then a lot of Seattle I found to be the same. I walked everywhere and had no problems. The hotel is a 15min walk or so from the Victoria Clipper terminal. Its right beside Pike Place which is a lively place with loads of places to get breakfast and stuff. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the shopping hub with all your shops.

Called to book; only "shared bathroom" queen room was avail. I lived/traveled in Europe for over a year; didn't think shared bath would be a problem. However, fiance and I shared a bathroom (one toilet, one shower) with an entire floor (we stayed in room 403). That is, 25 rooms: 1 bathroom. Yes, you read correctly, 25 rooms with at least 2 people in each room, and ONE bathroom. Everytime, day/night/6am/midnight/noontime that we tried to use shower, it was busy. Paper-thin walls, no shower, toilet so far from room, tiny room with dirty sink in room, and smaller-than-reserved-bed...well, we were miserable. Asked to change rooms but were told they were full. Tried to find another hotel in Seattle for under $150/night, impossible. Loved the town but will never, never, never stay at this hotel again. Passed many homeless/drunk/druggie-looking types on way to hotel each night---for sure I wouldn't have felt safe without my 6'5" fiance on my arm.

The hotel is clean, friendly and it has a nice authentic touch. We stayed for four days in two adjoining rooms with a bathroom in the middle. The rooms had enough space, the beds were okay and we liked the antique details like the lamps and the doors. Also great was the distance to Pike Place, shops and restaurants (Crocodile CafÃ© is fun, also for breakfast!). The bathroom was a bit small but the shower was hot and the origami towels were really nice. But... don't expect roomservice or fancy shampoos.

We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival. When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation and that that room was booked. We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend, so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying. They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead, one renovated where the kids stayed, and one that had not been renovated. Had difficulty locking the door to one room, lock seemed out of alignment. My wife hated the room. There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning, she had trouble sleeping. The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street, while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away.

Parking is terrible, expensive. .<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8218838">This "boutique" hotel is different because it is very plain. No a/c, small tvs, and minimalist decor. This is NOT a fancy place, but it is the right price for budget-minded travellers. The biggest problems are: 1. PARKING- The hotel has no parking and no agreement with local garages. You'll wind up parking nearby for about $20/day with limited access to your car, especially after dark. 2. Neighborhood- While it is two blocks from the Pike Place market, the street is a little rundown and a little shady after dark. The street noise might keep you awake at night in the summer. 3. Maintenance- The hot water did not work in our bathroom sink and the elevator is small and noisy. After 9pm, you have to use the elevator All those things being said, you cannot deny the value of this hotel for its location. Just be prepared to get the level of amenities appropriate for your money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8204534">We stayed for one night at this hotel, which is clean, quiet and has a great, central location. Not to mention having reasonable rates! I would say, however, that the hotel is still undergoing redecoration and we were given a very drab room that had us thinking of the song "Hotel California". On the other hand, we DID arrive prior to check-in, but the staff were very friendly and could see we were eager to get settled. Had we been patient I am certain we would have been put in one of the newer rooms. The Pike Place Market is two blocks away (downhill), and Belltown is right there so there are plenty of options for dining. Seattle is also a very walkable city (aside from some of those hills). I am not the type who really takes decor into consideration, though. All I really want is a room for a reasonable rate that is clean, quiet, comfortable and located in a good area. And the Moore Hotel certainly met all of those qualifications. They also have cable television and free internet access if you bring your laptop. If you're expecting doorman service, bellhops, extra linens, etc., this is not the place for you.

When I was searching the web for a place to have a mini-family reunion, I was pleased to find the Moore Hotel. One could tell that the owners are trying to keep its 1907 flavor. The ceiling lighting fixtures and cast iron bathtubs were true to the hotel's era. The Moore reminded me of some of the hotels that I have stayed in in Europe. We had two private sleeping rooms with a Jack-n-Jill bathroom on the 6th floor. One room had a queen bed and the other had two twin beds. The beds were very comfortable. The furniture was your basic budget hotel variety and was well kept. The closets were huge. I enjoyed looking out the windows at the different periods of architecture in the area and the bits of the waterfront that could be seen beyond the buildings. Our rooms were basic, but very clean. There is no air conditioning, but the windows opened to allow for a nice breeze. Each room also had a fan. The staff was the best!! Everyone aimed to please. They guided us to some great eateries, explained the parking situation so that we were able to stretch our vacation dollars, and helped us polish off a birthday cake from Cold Stone's Creamery. There is a room where the management will hold your luggage after checkout time if need be. The location was great! We were two blocks up from Pike Market, four blocks from the car rental office, and four blocks from the mono-rail station that took us to the Space Needle and Seattle Center. We encountered some homeless people in the area, but we also encountered them in other parts of Seattle as well. None of them were rude or forceful. The area around the hotel buzzes with nightlife as there are a variety of clubs in the area. This was a plus for us as we had a birthday in our group that needed to be celebrated with more than cake and ice cream. The only drawback that we encountered was the noise from the street. We used our portable radio as "white noise" and were not bothered by the traffic sounds. We will definitely be back!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8001197">The Moore Hotel itself is an excellent place to stay for the money but not so much if you are driving a vehicle.

On our first stay we arrived before check in, but when the desk clerk heard our story about being stranded by the airport shuttle in the rain without our suitcases &amp; not knowing where we were, he volunteered to find us a room we could check into early. The room was VERY clean &amp; I thought it was alot larger than some newer hotel rooms. The tub is old, so it was huge! You can lay down in it. The bed was comfortable.Our rooms had recently been redone. In the morning we asked the desk clerk were we could catch a cab to the terminal, she said have a seat and I'll call you one. Did'nt expect this much service for the price. On our second stay we arrived very early, 8:30(cruise ships are in at 6AM). The clerk stored our bags for us &amp; told us that check in wasn't until 3PM but that we would probably be tired by than &amp; to come back around noon &amp; she would have a room for us. She did! Both rooms we had were near the elevator, it didn't bother us at all. We delt with 3-4 different front desk employees, all were more than friendly and very helpful. We did see some homeless in the area, but no one bothered us. TWO blocks from Pike's Market &amp; walking distance to the water, Seattle Center, the monorail &amp; more! This was a bargin of a lifetime. About a block away is the Virginia Inn. We had a great dinner there on our first night. Lowell's in the market is really good for breakfast (ate there both mornings). Met friends there our first day for lunch, the clam chowder is horrible. Ivars on the water has the best clam chowder I have ever had.(Had this the second time thru Seattle) Another great bargin. The double decker (narrated) bus tour.. $18. per person, good for 2 days.

The toilet and shower room were across the coridoor. They could have done with a refurb but shower pressure was great and they were clean. It is really close to Pike Place and pretty much every attraction is in walking distance (depending on how far you fancy walking). The decor is alittle on the dull side but nothing to really bother about. Staff were really helpfull and friendly. Location is fairly safe (we didn't have any problems) but Seatlle does have its fair share of crazies but they are pretty harmless.

Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver. Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget. Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be. On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check in was turned away as place was full-so book ahead. Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean. No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs. The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.Ok so 125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote- 125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on. A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of said remote-shrug of shoulders-"our guests take them home you know" set TV to CNN for duration of my stay. Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/ Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ? no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pm and Sunday all day free. Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m. A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room, not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle and splutter and keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlites decide its time to go home.I nod off into a fitful sleep.

The hotel lobby is pretty spartan, but the front desk staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay. There is one free internet terminal in the lobby, but we did not use it. Unlike many similar hotels I've stayed in, the elevator at the Moore is modern and pretty speedy, though small. Our 7th floor room (714 - single queen bed) was clean and comfortable, with a nice view of Puget Sound over the rooftops of neighboring buildings. We enjoyed watching the ferries come and go. Amenities were minimal (no clock in the room, no toiletries beyond basic soap, poor TV reception) but we felt safe and comfortable for our entire stay. The building has been renovated, but historic touches, like original solid wood doors and old-fashioned brass keys, remain. Lack of water pressure and temperature regulation in the shower are my biggest complaints. We didn't have any problems with noise. The location was excellent; within easy walking distance of the convention center and major hotels where our conference was located and major attractions such as Pike Place Market. The neighborhood felt reasonably safe. We arrived by train and found it easy to hop on a city bus that took us almost to the door of the hotel. The bus ride was free because it was within Seattle's downtown "fareless" area.

Room was nice from the walls up, but the floor squeaked horribly, everywhere. We had not been informed of the "no guests" rule when I made the reservation--only the people sleeping in the room may enter it. Definitely the kind of information you want before making a reservation. The people at the desk when we checked in and out were nice, but the night man was AWFUL. My roommates got on the elevator at the same time as someone in another room who had brought a guest. The night man stopped the elevator to badger those people, and couldn't get the elevator restarted, resulting in my roommates having to climb the 7 flights of stairs (while one of them was still recovering from a bad back injury). BUT THE WORST THING OF ALL was when the night man took one of my friends to be a drunk and refused to rent a room to him. My friend has cerebal palsy, and happened to be the headliner at the Moore Theater that night. Overall, it was a bad experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6133661">We looked for a long time to try and find a reasonably-priced hotel for the 4 nights we would be staying downtown. As you might imagine it is very expensive to stay downtown Seattle. In fact the West Coast has a much higher cost-of-living than Milwaukee. We checked out chain hotels, discount travel sites, and bed-and-breakfasts â€” but ultimately it was a travel guide (Frommerâ€™s 2005) that suggested The Moore Hotel. Itâ€™s 2 blocks from the Public Market and sits on a main street (2nd ave) 1 mile from the train station. Itâ€™s 3 blocks southeast to the West Lake bus tunnel and there are literally dozens of cafes / clubs / and shops in every direction. We walked from the Amtrak station to the Hotel with our luggage when we arrived; and we walked from the Hotel to the bus station when we left - ideally situated for use of public transportation. We opted for the $55/night room which has no bathroom (â€™european styleâ€™). This was half the rate we found even at most â€˜discountâ€™ chains. The bathroom was about 10â€² from our room and we had our own key - so even though it was not a â€˜privateâ€™ bathroom, it was never inconvenient. The picture on the Moore website is not one of the european style rooms - ours was much smaller. The hotel was built around the turn of the [20th] century so thereâ€™s a lot of historic details that make it an exciting place to stay - tall ceilings, lots of windows, exposed woodwork, wide hallways. And most (if not all) of the 7 story hotel has been refurbished with new carpeting, fresh paint and retiled floors. In fact, the room we were in had brand new lamps, bed and TV. There is also a phone in each room (dial â€˜9â€² to get out) and basic cable. The only negative observations about our room were that the sink (all rooms have sinks) had no hot water pressure and Harmonie thought there should have been a full-length mirror and there was no clock. We were on the 7th floor - room 711 to be exact - and were afforded a great view of the Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. Iâ€™ll upload some movies when I have some extra time so you can get a feel for the layout. I would highly, highly recommend staying here if youâ€™re ever in Seattle - and ask specifically for room 711 as some of rooms are in-facing (thereâ€™s a kind of a â€˜courtyardâ€™ space running up the center of the hotel so that in-facing rooms can open to the fresh airâ€¦ but itâ€™s not a pretty view) and some of the south-facing rooms are on an alley. There is also 1 public-use internet terminal and wireless access in the lobby. The workers were very helpful with suggestions and they provide a big rack of literature for tourist-y things-to-do. The clientele seems quite mixed, with a lot of younger / international travelers as well as some older. I didnâ€™t see any families. There is no pool or arcade, but there is an adjoining lounge/bar and theatre (which was, unfortunately, playing â€˜Annieâ€™ while we were there) which gets touring bands every now-and-then. Also thereâ€™s no breakfast or coffee. There is also an elevator for those that donâ€™t like walking up seven flights of old-timey stairs. So, once again - the Moore Hotel comes highly recommended.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6111643">The Moore appealed to my friend and I because it was in downtown Seattle and was, by far, the most "bang for our buck". At $70 a night in the downtown area, we didnt expect much but after reading the reviews, we looked forward to seeing the charm of a well- taken-care-of hotel from yesteryear. We didnt find what we were looking for. Our room was a sloppy mix of one picture of a skyscraper, furniture from an office in Hawaii in the 80's and an awful lamp that had a crack on one side. Although I craned my head out of the window and got a magnificent view of downtown, I tried not to open it that often due to the bad draft coming in. We had no shampoo for the shared bath down the hall. One of the toilets had a problem and you had to push a button inside commode to flush it. And if we hadnt had a small desk fan in the room for quiet noise, we would've heard everything downstairs. We were SEVEN floors off the street. As we wandered the hallways, we found that there was nothing charming about the hotel other than its old fixtures. The whole place is in dire need of plants, pictures and color. Parking was an absolute nightmare; THIS HOTEL HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY OF THE PARKING GARAGES OR LOTS. It was "every man for himself" and more than slightly frustrating. Although the older front desk clerk kindly explained the procedures, I found it very inconvenient to have to get up at 7am or 8am and run down to pay for the parking after already paying for it overnight. The Moore did have something going for it: a very awesome location. Only a couple of blocks from Pike Place Market and anything else downtown. That was about it, however. Good price? Yes. Good location? Absolutely. Worth it? No.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6012436">Given its central downtown location and low price, the Moore is a very good value for a two-star. For the price, it's not fancy but adequate, clean, and roomy. The elevator and hallways are small and rather dingy but the rooms are fine. Beds are good, TV has sufficient channel selection, telephone, bathroom normal size with adequate motel-type towels/face cloths, soap, no shampoo, etc. There's no air conditioning, but there's a small fan in the room that was barely sufficient. Being from a rural area, we didn't find the street noise to be bad at all and we were on the front of the hotel facing 1st. Ave. It's about what you'd expect for a city but not objectional - running the fan for some "white noise" helps. We would definitely concur with other reviewers that an upper floor (5 or higher) is definitely recommended. They have free internet service in the lobby as well. The staff was not overly helpful or friendly but provided acceptable service. The best thing was it's central location to Pike Market, good restaurants, and all the downtown sites within the free bus ride area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5814218">I recently visited the Moore Hotel with my family for the purpose of doing some sightseeing and to take in a couple Mariner baseball games. I booked a couple rooms for a long weekend, having stayed at the Moore previously on recommendations from friends. My family completely enjoyed their stay. There are three things about the Moore Hotel that make it a hotel I highly recommend - the character, the location and the value. The Moore is one of Seattle's more historic hotels with the charm of a bed and breakfast. Though an older building, it does not lack in comfort or amenities. Rooms are extremely generous in size. They easily accommodate two queen beds and the 12 foot ceilings allow large windows and wonderful views of the historic neighborhood. The finishes have been recently remodeled and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The hotel staff is personable, polite and accommodating. They make you feel like you are spending a weekend in their home, rather than in a hotel in a major city. A small lobby with marble floors and cozy sitting area for internet access lends to the bed and breakfast atmosphere. The hotel is located two blocks up from Pikes Place Market and two blocks north of the central shopping district. Its in an ideal location for easy walking to high end shopping or laid back cafes, boutiques and restaurants. There is plenty of parking in nearby garages or lots. The free downtown bus stops nearby and we felt very safe walking after dark from baseball games. And finally the value. The rates are unbeatable in a downtown location. You can spend two and three times as much in a nearby national chain hotel. That says it all. The Moore is a great choice for a comfortable, economical stay in the heart of downtown Seattle.

So for the traveler who appreciates a clean, classic hotel in a prime, downtown Seattle location, this is for you. We've twice chosen the Moore for a pre-cruise stay with our kids in a suite of two conjoined rooms seperated by the bathroom. It's right downtown, so there is typical noise from trucks/sirens; but the beds were comfortable and showed no sign of bugs as others claimed. My only caution is to use the same ordinary caution outside as you would in any urban area after dark. The staff is incredibly cool, accomodating and provide free internet access in the lobby to check email, etc. I have recommended this hotel to like minded frugal friends and look forward to the next time we visit Seattle for another stay at the Moore.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5811189">Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks. The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met. I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room, he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue. Very, very dissapointed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5724517">The best part of the hotel was the staff. I enjoyed sitting in the lobby watching the goings on. Interesting and nice people. They have a computer set up in the lobby for you to use as you wish for free. I was able to check emails. I booked the hotel because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was prepared for anything. I booked it because I did not want to spend 170 and up for an overnight before a cruise. You enter a small lobby with a few chairs to comfortably sit in, and one person working at the desk. A 2nd person is usually in the office next to the desk. Check out when parking is free on the streets before you pay 10 dollars for about 10 hours of parking in the lots. I think we could have saved 10 dollars if we read the signs. They are extremely nice and helpful. I can not say enough about how much I enjoyed them. You then take an elevator to your floor. When the elevator door opens, you start to giggle. "I can't believe I booked this hotel". I hope you have a sense of humor, or don't expect much. Expect the worst for ambience. The hotel is old. Very old. The walls have been painted over in a very dark color, along with almost black colored carpeting in a wide hallway. You get the feeling of entering an old dormitory at an old, and I stress OLD, school . You walk down the depressing hall to the door (which has one real key even if you have 4 people in the room). You leave the key at the front desk when you leave if others might need it to get in. We stayed in a 2 queen bed room. There were 4 of us. The bed was comfortable enough. The decor was 1944 bland. There was no place to put anything down in the bathroom, like a counter. The toilet was so close to the wall on its left that your butt hit the wall if you sat down. You had to sit more to the right. The flusher hit the wall, so they cut a hole in the wall to be able to flush the toilet. The shower was fine. Fat people could not use the facility here. Not in my room. There is no screen in the window and no air conditioning. We left the window open all night (birds could have flown in as there were many), and traffic noise went on. I had no problem sleeping, but others could not stand the sound of traffic. I was exhausted and crashed with no problem. Staying near Pikes Market means you are in the run down part of town. I would prefer to stay in a nicer section. I did not realize how scary it could be.You are literally a 5 minute walk from the Market, and a block or 2 further to the waterfront. It is all downhill, so remember you need to walk back up again. During the day it was ok. We walked past a lot of scary people. I would not go out at night. I did get up earlier than the rest of the group, and since I had no place to watch tv without disturbing them, I went downstairs. They told me there was a McDonalds that opens at 630am. I walked there. about 3 blocks.I met all the drunks in recovery while I bought my coffee. Starbucks opens at 7. I brought the coffee back to the hotel and sat in the lobby, comfortably reading until about 930 when others got up. Seattle seems to be the most expensive city in the country. I don't think you will be murdered if you stay here, but I think I would prefer to stay at the airport the next time I overnight for a cruise. Or in a nicer neighborhood. If you walk in the opposite direction from your hotel you come to a really nice (expensive) section with Nordstroms, and all sorts of expensive fancy stores. A nice area. Way too expensive to stay there. There is a steak house across from the hotel (on the corner) that I really wish I had a chance to visit. It was Argentina beef and I remember that being awesome when I had it in the old days. I bet it is good.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5700717">No frills, but clean, unique, and in the city center. The Moore Hotel is in an old building with a marble entryway and lobby. We stayed in rooms with private bathroom inside the rooms, but "European" style shared bath rooms are also available. The rooms we stayed in had wooden doors, and the bathtubs inside had "feet" like old-style bathtubs, though these also had shower connections. The rooms were clean and well-maintained, though there was no air conditioning. Windows open onto the street, which means that there's some noise from the street. Staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about things to do in the city. We compared notes with some folks staying at a local youth hostel and found that our private rooms in the Moore Hotel were about the same price. Since this is one of the least expensive places to stay in the city, I would recommend it to anybody looking for budget accomodations with old-style character. Most of the major tourist attractions in downtown Seattle are within walking distance. We found the neighborhood to be safe. There's a single free Internet terminal in the lobby for those wanting to check their e-mail.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5661558">My husband and I booked a room at the Moore Hotel based on all of the glowing reviews and the amazing price (we paid $89.01 for one night in downtown Seattle). Although the price was great, the room was less than great. Nothing was technically wrong but everything was very very old and smelled very strongly of cleaning supplies even after I opened the windows for several hours. And, I am usually not bothered by "downtown" noise, but the windows must have been incredibly thin because I woke up multiple times due to sirens and other noises even though we were all the way up on the 6th floor. On the other hand...like I said above, the price is hard to beat for downtown Seattle and the location itself is great! We were within walking distance of great restaurants, nightlife, Pike's Market, and the waterfront! So...if you are looking for a nice and relaxing place to stay, the Moore may not be it; but...if you are looking for a cheap (and clean) place with a great location, the Moore is for you. One more thing...parking. The Moore does not have a parking lot or garage so you have one of three options: (1) park on the street after 8/9ish at night for free so long as you wake up and pay the "meter" at 8AM the next morning, (2) get to the hotel before 8/9ish (call and see what time) and park in a garage across the street for $15 for a day a think, or (3) park in one of the many lots around the hotel but pay a lot of money. We ended up parking the car on the street because we got to the hotel too late to park in the cheap garage; then, in the morning (8AM), we moved the car into one of the lots around the hotel for "early bird" parking ($10 for all day).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5623382">The Moore Hotel is an older building, yet scrupulously cleaned and maintained. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The prices were great. However, its chief advantage is its location. At the corner of 2nd St. and Virgininia, it is only two blocks from Pike Place Mkt! It is also within easy walking distance of the Convention Center area. One block either way puts you on major city bus lines to connect to the stadiums to the south, or the Space Needle to the north. Airport transportation via the Shuttle Express vans drops you off/picks you up at the door of the moore for a great price. Two cruise lines dock at the waterfront directly below the Moore, but HAL and RCL dock closer to the Pioneer Square area. We stayed two nights pre-cruise, and two nights post-cruise at the Moore and felt it was a bargain. I would advist to request the upper floors, as street noise was noticeable in our room on the fourth floor. Also be aware that there is no air conditioning, but this was not a problem at all during our stay in August, 2006. If you want luxury and pampering this is not the place for you. However, for a clean room at a great price and in a great location, the Moore is the place. I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5589917">My boyfriend had stayed at the Moore Hotel 6 years ago on a cross-country trip, so when he suggested that we stay there on our recent trip to Seattle, I let him take care of our vacation plans. We took public transit ( MT194 / $1.25) from SEATAC, which lets you off 3 blocks from the hotel - an easy walk. This place is fantastic for the money if you don't require a lot of "extras." They offer shared and private baths (the private baths go pretty quickly), and we tried out each. Even the shared bath option gives you a sink in your room. The hotel feels much like a hostel at first - it's old and not in the best visual condition, the hallways are a little dark, the elevator only holds a couple of people, and the doors to the rooms require *gasp* actual KEYS! The neighborhood is a little gritty, but we never felt unsafe at any time. It is a highly trafficked area, so you're seldom wandering about by yourself. Once inside the room, it's a pretty bare bones setup, but everything was super clean, functional, we had a fantastic view of the water, and the building is constructed like a prison (thick plaster walls), so we never heard a peep from our neighbors. The close proximity to just about everything is amazing - we walked to Pioneer Square (~25 minutes), Safeco Park (~35 minutes), Pike Place Market (less than 5 minutes), and took a quick bus ride over to the Seattle Center. This place is central to everything you'll need to explore Seattle efficiently and thoroughly. If you're into fancypants-type accomodations and need a lot of catering to, this place is not for you. There are no clocks in the room, no pictures on the wall, you may/may not get a mirror in your room, but the place is well worth the money that you'll save, and the service that we received from everyone working there was 5-star. They definitely have a lifelong customer in my guy and myself. The Moore Hotel is located smack on the border of Belltown, which is loaded with great eats, great bars, and tons of twenty/thirty-something hispters. For food, check out Le Pichet, Dahlia Lounge, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, OHanas, and Caffe D'Arte for awesome coffee/teas (skip Starbucks/Tully's). For entertainment, the Virigina Inn is a nice place to grab a beer, while places like Lava Lounge, Shorty's Coney Island, and The Whiskey Bar are more chaotic, but still good fun. The Palace Kitchen is a great late-night option, and they serve free pistachios at the bar.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5473111">I did not feel safe at this hotel. Couples may feel more comfortable but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice. I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller]. When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite and the other night I would have to move room and share a bathroom. Totally unacceptable as a lone female. When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere. Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else]. I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5444055">We stayed here before a cruise last week. The location is great, the price is right, and the rooms are decent. The staff was very helpful. If you want to pay $250 a night for a few hours in a room go ahead, but I would saty here again in a minute. The bathroom was fine. Small TV, but your not there to watch TV. Don't expect the Ritz, but you will do fine. You can keep your luggae in a closet while you chaeck out Seattle before the cruise. Take a Taxi to the cruise. They will call the cab. Thanks Moore Hotel!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5412914">The Moore is an old place in a good section of downtown, between Seattle Center &amp; Pike Place Market. Our first room was on the street &amp; was a bit noisy (there's no A/C, so we had the windows open). We switched the next night to a courtyard room, but you still get some reflected traffic noise. The courtyard rooms surround the Moore Theater, so you might not want to stay there on a concert night (unless you don't go to bed early). I'd still prefer this over the budget hotels near Seattle Center.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5374316">As a solo Canadian traveling through Seattle for the first time I am so glad I ended up at the Moore Hotel! I'd been on the road for a bit and my credit cards were running low, about $70 left on my MasterCard. After being turned away from half a dozen downtown hotels I found myself in the lobby of the Moore. The front desk was understanding and set me up with the most affordable, safe downtown room I could ever dream of! I was able to get a huge basic room with beautifuly clean baths and washrooms down the hall. The location is perfect for the city sights and sounds and walking distance to everything. The Bar staff and regulars were very welcoming to a stranger, being a Chef, I soon realized I was in the after work hangout for the downtown service industry. What would be the chances of ending up in the place I'd be hanging out at if I worked and lived in Seattle? I have a couple Seattle trips planned for this year and there is no doubt where I will be staying. Falling in love with your city started at The Moore Hotel!

The room was huge, while sparsely decorated. The bathroom was average - small, and there was a large walk-in closet. There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle. The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room. The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport. The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated. The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone, so you don't have to walk if you don't want to. Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night. I'd stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5291915">My friend and I stayed at the Moore for one night during the memorial day weekend. I booked a hotel in Seattle for the rest of the stay and just needed a hotel for the first night--which was difficult to find since all the hotels seemed to be booked on that night. So I found the Moore as a fluke through tripadvisor.com-- I did a search for hotels that were under $100 dollars a night in the downtown region and the Moore came up and ranked #15 of all seattle hotels. I read through the reviews and was a little nervous at first since some compared it to a hostel or sleazy motel. But I noticed those reviews were quite early and the most recent reviews were pretty favorable so I decided to book. Plus the night my friend and I arrived in Seattle we had to catch a show at the Crocodile Cafe--which was only 3 blocks away from the moore. When we got to the hotel, we observed how a couple in front of us were treated since there was a mix up with their reservation. apparently they reserved two queen beds with private bath, but since there was a glitch in the reservation system (that neglected to acknowlege that the two queen rooms were sold out) the person at the front desk offered the couple a room with 2 beds and a single that was connected together at a discounted price. When it became our turn to check in, he did the same for us except we got a room with 1 queen bed and 1 and twin bed. The person at the front desk was really nice and cordial. Now on to the actual hotel... The room was decently clean but no frills--lacked little amenities such as remote control. But I think the lobby had a free internet terminal and I saw a few people downstairs using wireless. Since the moore is located in the heart of Seattle's trendy Belltown neighborhood as soon as you step out of the moore, there's tons of bars and restaurants at your feet at night, and litlte trendy shops and salons to visit in the day. Pike Place Market is an easy walk as well. So it's not bad considering the price (esp with the 10 dollar discount) and convenient location, so it's definitely recommended for students or others on a budget.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5289730">The other reviews seem to have it right - best part about this place is the location. Easy walking distance to everywhere. We were on the top floor, so we weren't kept awake by any street traffic, but I can't vouch for the lower rooms.

The lobby is falling apart (like most of the building)the rooms are big, i'll give them that, but the bed sheets were torn and stained, horrible old mattress, pillows that me think it would be better if i laid my head on a brick.

I was excited when I found this hotel from this website, sounded fantastic. Maybe that's why I was dissapointed when I stepped in the hotel. It's obviously a budget hotel, not so nice. Some of staff were not so nice like other comments say. But there was at least one guy who was helpful. I stayed queen single room with bath. The room was really large, but the bathroom was old and terrible since it has cracks on the really old tiles etc... and everything in bathroom is 100 years old. Water pressure was weak. Somehow, the furnitures in room are new, so that's good part. I asked room with view, and it had a good view, but comes with some street noise.

Although the lobby appears relatively modern, the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s. Rooms are very basic to say the least, but you only get what you pay for and the Moore represents fair value. The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable. Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit. However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming. We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite. Internet access is free in the lobby and the Moore's downtown location is good. Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead. The location is better,safer,cleaner and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4048796">I stayed at the Moore Hotel 10/12-10/18.

It wasn't exactly as one would expect: one entered, and had to pass through, one bedroom to get to the others. The bathroom was off of another of the bedrooms. But since we were all friends traveling together, it wasn't too bad. There were doors between each bedroom, so you could have privacy if you needed it. There were no kitchen facilities, but there was a small fridge in one room, and a sink in another. Two bedrooms had tvs. It was a shame to be so close to Pike's Place Market without kitchen facilities, but there were lots of good restaurants nearby. The location was great for being able to see the touristy sites. I took a public bus in from the airport, the hotel was only a block away. In fact, when we finally picked up a rental car, we just left it in the garage for 3 days, rather than deal with the whims of Seattle's meter maids. We had a view of the bay from one room, and the Space Needle from two of the rooms. The bar across the street tends to be a bit rowdy at night, and there was always some "interesting" activity down on the street at nights, but we weren't concerned about safety when walking about late at night. Almost as bad as the bar was a nest of raucous seagulls atop the apartment across the street - who needs a wake-up call? With the coupon, the week cost us $335 per person. It would be hard to find a better deal in such a convenient location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3983681">For the price 80$ per night it was a very fair price and the perfect location.

I went for the absolute cheapest rooms at this, the absolute cheapest place to stay in Seattle (short of a flophouse). The $45-a-night room with no bathroom was fine: spacious, quiet, and sanitary. TV and sink in the room were an unexpected extra at these rock-bottom prices. The shared bathroom just down the hallway presented no problems, and housekeeping kept it clean enough. And of course, you can't beat the location -- two blocks from Pikes place, walking distance to just about everything. Parking isn't provided by the hotel, but there's plenty of parking lots/garages within one block. The garage across the street is pricey and atmospherically gothic, but convenient -- it allows overnight parking and doesn't demand that you show up at 7 am to renew your parking as most other lots do; note that it closes at 10 pm, though. Hint: on-street parking is free all day Sunday.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3744928">I consider the Moore Hotel a good deal for downtown Seattle. The location is very close to the harbour and the piers. Although the neighbourhood is not the best, I never felt unsafe. The room was clean enough but the lamp did not have a lamp shade.

Unfortunately, I had to change rooms after two days although I made my reservation a long time in advance.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3737974">I stayed here last month and was terribly disappointed. After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price. I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle. However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap. First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle. There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider "bad", and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town. Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room. After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!! I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies. I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep. Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking. I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking, but the Moore had nothing. I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day. My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place! Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3724079">great, practical hotel at an outstanding price. walking distance to so much. great, friendly staff. again, great price for great location. room is simple, bathrooms with claw feet tubs!

I was surprised by all of the positive reviews it had, because I hadn't come across it on expedia, orbitz, etc. I was a little skeptical but stayed there for 3 nights in June. After my experience staying at the Moore, I felt that I definitely had to post a review. For anyone who's a little weary about how reliable on-line reviews are, the Moore Hotel will not disappoint. My room was huge, clean, and as a single female traveler, I felt completely safe. The location is unbeatable--just 2 short blocks from Pike Place Market.

When I plugged in my blowdryer in the morning---the lights dimmed from the power drain...the windows were very thin and you can hear the sirens going down 2nd and Virginia through the night..Luky for me---my visit to the Liquid lounge by the Space Neddle provided me with a little extra sleeping power. The location can not be beat---Walk to Pikes and the waterfront as well as the mall and the Monorail. The Rail stops at 7pm and the taxi ride back from the Space Needle was only $4.50 exc. tip.

Very close to Downtown Seattle, bus lines, the ferries and only a few short blocks north of Pike Place Market. If you are looking for plush towels and jacuzzi's, stay elsewhere. If you are looking for historical ambience, a staff that cares and to save yourself some money, the Moore cannot be beat. You can tell they are really trying to make this a well loved place to stay and at the rates charged, it's hard not to love this old beauty of a hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3222620">Had two seperate stays at The Moore. First room was on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the Puget Sound. The room had updated furniture, bathroom fixtures and possibly new carpet. I was pleasantly surprised. I was prepared for the small and thin towels. The water pressure wasn't good and I am not that finicky. Second room had bad water pressure as well. There was music at the Theatre one night, but at least it was soothing to fall asleep too. Can't say enough about the helpful and knowledgable staff. Kudos! GREAT LOCATION!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3026646">This is a very historic place. The rooms are clean and the location is convenient, but hotel ammenities such as shampoo, notepaper, coffee-maker are missing. The radiator clangs throughout the night (when it's cold outside) and there's not even a clock to tell what time it is. If you're on a budget, I would recommend the Moore Hotel, just don't expect any luxuries.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3023274">I have stayed at the Moore Hotel the last 3 times I have been to Seattle. The location is perfect! Walking distance to Pike Place, Downtown and even the Space Needle. Resturants are all over and the Crocodile cafe is a block away. My only concern would be if it was hot in Seattle. There is no A/C.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2905146">I stayed at the Moore Hotel on Dec 3rd, 4th and 5th, 2004 and I have to say the Moore Hotel had it's positives and some negatives. If you are a tourist and want to check out some of Seattle's downtown famous attractions like The Space Needle, Pike's Place Market and Pioneer Square then the Moore is a great hotel to stay in because you can walk to all three of these locations from the hotel. The Moore Hotel has clean rooms, they are kind of old, but it's a clean place to sleep and shower. The staff are very friendly, but the only bad side is, you won't get the nice bathroom amneties in a Holiday Inn or a Hilton. The Moore Hotel's bathrooms are small (they are clean) but small, the towels are very thin and not full bath size, so bring your own. Other than that, it's a nice place to sleep and stay for a short period of time. We had a room facing Elliot's Bay, and it was a beautiful view. There is a large mall about 3 blocks from the hotel. Pike's Place market is 2 blocks from the Moore Hotel, the space needle is about 8 blocks away, and you can catch the free city bus to Pioneer Square if you don't feel like walking 10 blocks. Basically, the Moore Hotel is a clean place to sleep at night, it's clean and the rates are very reasonable for a hotel in downtown Seattle. I'd stay there again, for a short time. If you are arriving in Seattle from Sea-Tac International Airport, use the transportation company 'Shuttle Express', they have vans that take you from the airport to the hotel for about $20 bucks...they are efficient, on-time, friendly, and affordable...they dropped us off and picked us up from the Moore Hotel perfectly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2830194">The Moore was a great base for a first trip to Seattle. The rooms are large and bright, and although some of the bathroom fittings were a bit elderly, everything is very clean.

My husband and I go to Seattle about once or twice a year and never think of staying anywhere else. The hotel is starting to show its age, but our room is always clean, the staff is always courteous, and it's got the most convenient location a tourist could ask for. (Easy walk to lots of great restaurants, shopping, Pike Place, etc.) Highly recommend it. Plus, at that great price, you have extra money for some of the great restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. (Marco's Supper Club is our favorite.)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118758250">Miauw Suites looked great on the internet but the reality is completely different. This is not actually a hotel as it has no facilities outside of the rooms whatsoever. Having lugged our bags up the steep stairs to the first floor (no elevator) we arrived in the White Room. The temperature was around 90 degrees inside (despite being 70 outside) and there is no air conditioning. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to experience a boutique hotel but this was appalling in every way. We checked out straight away and found alternative accommodation close by that was very good. Miauw Suites has declined to refund any of our costs for the 2 night stay. I understand that we arrived at 3pm on the first day and that it would be unlikely that the room could be sold again but feel that the second night should have been refunded.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117879342">The TRIPADVISOR reviews were so glowing that I chose Miauw Suites over many other possibilities. Supposedly my husband and I had been upgraded from a room to a suite, but the space didn't seem to be a suite by what I consider a suite. The bed was very comfortable; the room was clean; the young woman Maya who showed us to our room was very helpful and nice; the building was on a canal. But the room/suite was probably not worth the price we paid. Given that there is no lobby or concierge service, we walked a block to the Hotel Pulitzer and used their concierge services. They were very helpful in arranging a day tour to Rotterdam, Madurodam, Delft, a flower market, etc. They also got us taxis once or twice. Several days after we returned home, I read an article in the New York Times about people getting paid $5 to write positive reviews about hotels or restaurants. I was sad to read that the authenticity of some of the TRIPADVISOR reviews might be compromised.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR107575563">I rarely write travel reviews but with our stay at Miauw, I just have to. First off, it's not your typical hotel but that's the reason why we chose this. Secondly, location is fantastic. Third, the rooms are spotless, greatly designed and furnished and well-maintained. Like what others have said, dreamy and airy, bathe in white and subtle colors, with fresh flowers during our entire stay. We stayed for 4 nights. Two nights at the White Room, 2 nights at the White Suite. The suite is like having your own apartment in AMS, complete with a functioning kitchen, dining and living area, and a serapate bedroom. The bathroom is decent and functional, can't really complain much about it.

I love design hotels and this one fit the bill, but was even more intimate, because it's almost like staying in your hip, stylish friend's spare room versus a veritable hotel. The room was a modern design lover's dream: charcoal walls, crisp white bedding that's just as comfortable as a Westin bed, an Apple computer in the room, fresh flowers and a view that is postcard-perfect. I would love to stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126442278">I was a little underwhelmed with this hotel. The price was good, though, so I wasn't expecting the world. I had read reviews saying the hotel was run down. It isn't. It's an older property so isn't brand-spankin' new, but it is certainly not run-down. We stayed in a basic room. It was a basic room. Standard layout. Small bathroom. Excellent bed. The lobby is unimpressive. There are no restaurants in the hotel except a coffee shop. However, there is a great italian place just up the street with the best tiramisu. The staff were very friendly. We came with two dogs, so we're not the most desirable clientele, but the staff were all very accommodating. All-in-all, there was nothing really wrong with this place but I don't think I would stay here again. It was just very average.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125664131">This was the first hotel we stayed on our westcoast trip and we stayed here for two nights. We already booked this hotel at home, especially because of the good reviews of other visitors regarding the great location. It was easy to reach from Seattle-Tacoma airport, a disadvantage is that there is no free parking available, we had to use the parking garage next to the hotel, which costs about 23$/day. The location is really excellent, many sights are in walking distance to the hotel (e.g. Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and Space Needle, waterfront, ...). Our room was nice, clean and had the perfect size. Only the bathroom was a little bit too small, but still okay. The only thing about this hotel which was not acceptable was this terrible smell in the corridor and even worse in the room! Due to the fact that we couldn't open the window entirely, there was no chance to get rid off this disgusting smell. However, after 5 minutes in the room we got used to it. In our opinion the room rate is too high (despite the great location) and therefore we would consider to look for another accomodation in this area for our next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125291091">this is a value priced hotel, and there are some inconveniences. however, some are to be expected when staying downtown in an older hotel in a large city. parking is around the corner, and will only allow for a normal height SUV at most. there are some stairs in both the parking structure and hotel before you get to the elevator, inconvenient when you have large bags. the rooms, albeit very small, have most of the modern conveniences. the air circulation, heating, cooling are not the best. the brite side is that the staff is wonderful, and the location is convenient to walk to the best shopping and embibing the city has to offer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124931970">We are frequent visitors to Seattle from Vancouver Canada. Take the train down, relax and walk about 15 minutes to this refurbished hotel. It isn't five star but it is good value and great location. Rooms: clean and neat. Bathroom: smallish but very well appointed. Location: excellent access to SAM and a few blocks to Pike Place (but transit in Seattle downtown is free, so don't take the car and pay for unnecessary silly parking). Staff: helpful and professional. Shout out to the doormen/bellmen: great guys who hustle those cabs late at night. Stop whining about "it isn't big enough" "we have to walk uphill": Hotel has all the amenities of a more luxurious stay: robes, hair dryer, coffee maker and upscale toiletries. Seattle is a get what you pay for place as most are and this is my best choice for a budget conscious weekend get away. Save a few bucks and go out for a great meal.

We only stayed one night in #423. Well, you get what you pay for. The location is good for being downtown, but you still have the street people present around the area enough to make you feel uncomfortable. If you are looking for roomy rooms, well donâ€™t come here. The rooms are nice, but very small. If you are a taller or a larger person the bathrooms within the room are not for you. The door and the wall are about 5-6 inches to the toilet (no leg room to sit properly). The only roomy thing in the bathroom is the tub and even that is only 5ft long. The cleanliness in the room was bad. The bathroom glass door was dirty with hand prints. The bedding looked like they changed the sheets and the pillow cases, but kept the down comforter from the previous tenant. The bed is hard and the walls to your neighbor are very thin. I could have had a decent conversation with my neighbor and understand what they were saying.

The location was perfect for our purpose: have a night out in downtown and attending a preview at the Seattle Art Museum the next morning. The Executive has an agreement with a parking next door and we payed $23 for a 24-hour parking period. Our room faced the Seattle Library. Noise from the street wasn't much of a problem, but I could hear other guests using their showers through the pipes. In the morning, I could hear people talking on the hallway and doors being slammed. Small room ,very small bathroom (no bath tub), but we didn't need anything more than what was being offered. There is a coffeemaker in the room and a Seattle's best Coffee at the lobby. When we visited, they were offering a 'wine reception' at the mezzanine â€“ that meant having a glass of wine before leaving for dinner. Nice!

There is a Seattle's Best Coffee shop inside the hotel which is great. The staff are pleasant and very helpful. Unfortunately that isn't the issue. We stayed here Saturday night in a Queen Room. The walls are so think I could hear someone next door coughing every 2-3 minutes. Then the person on the other side of us came in from a night on the town very loud and drunk. Coughing on one side, talking on the other..needless to say we couldn't get to sleep. In fairness, I don't think the people talking were talking that loud but it was still very annoying. We called the front desk and they graciously moved us to another room at 1 a.m. This room was a King and much nicer than the queen. I would only stay here again if I had a King room and asked for a corner unit. The decor has been updated but you can see that they only upgraded the essentials.

Staff was extremely friendly - great with recommendations. They allowed me to check in to my room several hours earlier than check in. The hotel is your typical downtown hotel in a historic building. In other words, pretty small (I had the basic queen room) but it should be enough for two people. Very clean, comfortable bedding. Location: although I thought Downtown Seattle had a surprisingly big city feel to it (it is very built up, great urban planning, great density in buildings) in reality, it isn't that big. That being said, all it means is that this hotel is very central and very walkable to all of the main attractions. One other thing, as mentioned by someone prior to me, the 5-6pm wine hour is really great. Free booze and you get to meet other people! And to the staff member who was planning to move to San Diego, I almost made it all the way to the airport on foot.

If Groupons are being offered to introduce the property for recommendations or return visits, they lost this recommendation and I won't be returning. So we had a Deluxe King....small room, small bathroom, itty bitty sink and I couldn't dry my hair without the power going out! I was even using the hairdryer provided in the room! One robe in the closet that was ...well I guess it was a robe. We were supposed to get wine and Sees candies in the room. My husband called down about the wine and about 15 minutes later this guy knocks on the door and says "Here." passing a bottle of $6.99 wine (the wine was supposed to be a $30 value) and a box of Russell Stover candy. After the delivery, we discovered there was not a corkscrew in the room. My husband called down about this and they said that they don't have corkscrews in the rooms, but there is one at the front desk. No offer to come up and open our wine...guess we were supposed to go down ourselves to open it. We decided to save it and bring it home....FAIL! All in all...ok..pretty clean, not what we expected. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to be in center of things downtown which the location of this hotel is excellent for that.

They do not offer continental breakfast, they do not have a fridge in the room. Booking travel comes with expectations based on the outline of hotel and room rate details. This hotel misrepresents what is offered. The rooms are very small but that is the expectation for a downtown hotel of this era. The bed was small and rather hard, pillows also flat. Bathroom ammenities were minimal and the sink very small. The location was very close to the stadiums but quite a distance from the markets on the waterfront. Reasonable for a reduced rate.

My son paid extra for a room with a city view and we received a room with a view of the parking garage. Please don't pay extra - its just one way they will screw you out of more money. The room had no a/c, only heat. The room was EXTREMELY stuffy and hot. They did give us a fan which helped just a bit and was told to open the window. Yeah right - couldn't open the window. It was cooler in the hall than the room. I cannot tolerate a warm or hot area. It was difficult to sleep - bed was small and uncomfortable along with having no air circulation. Bathroom was really, really small. Very disappointed. No continental breakfast although there is a coffee shop attached to the hotel. When we checked out, my son expressed his dislike and concerns and the girl on duty said that she would have the manager call my son. My son asked if she had his number and she stated "yes" and we knew she didn't because he booked through Expedia and the person on duty did not ask for a phone number when we checked in, so we knew she was lying. My son asked her what number she had and of course she couldn't say because (A) she really didn't care, (B) she had no plans of telling the manager and (C) She was lying.

One thing we love about this hotel is the fact that you can pretty much walk anywhere from this hotel, no need for taxi rides! We had reserved online with the advance purchase and got 20% off plus when we arrived and asked if it was possible to get an upgrade to a king size room, it was free! The bed was very comfy, the tv was good, alittle small, but it had cable tv, the room itself was clean and had everything we needed...one thing that would good in the rooms would be a mini fridge for drinks. The bathroom is nice, it was a little small, but it was clean &amp; have everthing we needed. A couple bonuses that we liked was a safe in the room as well as free wi-fi in our room! One thing to be aware of (we were not) is that you will be charged for all local calls. We did not know this, and when we got a bill at the end of our stay, I did dispute the charges because for one thing we were not told about this and also many of the calls we made had not been answered, so we felt we should not be charged. The Manager was great, and did discount the charge by half, which was good, but just beware...don't make any local calls at the hotel!

Although their user fees, like $0.75 per local phone call, seem to adhere to a luxury tier. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the place is clean and nice, has some vending machines on the mezzanine ($2 for a can of pop), and nice TVs in the room but the place was built in 1938 and it shows in some places. Sometimes charming like the tiling in the bathroom and the cast iron tub but other times downright irritating like the radiator that you canâ€™t turn off that constantly makes noise (it wasnâ€™t until I managed to force open the nearly-painted-shut window that I was finally able to get some sleep) or the bathtub not draining properly (I got a shower, my feet and ankles got a bath). The electrical outlet sparked at me more than once as I was plugging things in â€“ not only a fire and safety hazard but dangerous for your electronics. The staff are fantastic, check in is a breeze. When you check out thereâ€™s just a guy standing in the lobby â€“ no uniform, no nametag but very polite, helpful, and nicely dressed (in a sweater, not a suit), but part of me canâ€™t help but wonder how hard it would be for some grifter to just stand there and con people out of luggage, fees, credit cards, or whatever. If youâ€™re going from the train station the walk from the station is a killer as it is uphill the entire way at a significant incline. The toiletries that are supplied are nice, organic, and effective. Overall Iâ€™m not sure that this place is your best option in Seattle â€“ if youâ€™re driving there are much better and cheaper options further out from the downtown core and if youâ€™re not you may want to consider staying at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle. In the end a hotel is a place to sleep and that radiator problem makes that problematic at best so while this property has some nice touches it unfortunately fails in a fundamental way. Exceptional service canâ€™t make up for a bad nightâ€™s sleep.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120886317">So, let's start from the pros: This is place is in a good position, has a parking on the next door building (you have to pay extra, of course) and is below the average cost for a hotel in the city centre of Seattle. Let's go to the cons: Elevator was working intermittently, it happened that we sometimes had to wait for 20 min before we could use it, and once we used the stairs instead (bear in mind that we were on 7th floor). All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys. Going to the rooms: our was small, not so clean, and the bathroom was microscopic, too. We could barely fit our suitcases on the floor. We could hear noise coming both from the corridor, and from the neighboring room, which was pretty annoying especially late at night.

The front desk (Andrea) was efficient and every employee encountered was friendly. I loved the wine reception. A great way to meet others staying in the hotel! Excellent parking garage right next door.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120468515">The hotel is located in the heart of downtown. If you are arriving by car, you should expect steep hills, lots of one-way streets, a lack of on street parking and (of course) traffic in Downtown Seattle. Taxi would eliminate all of those issues. I had some challenges finding it, but that was probably more about me &amp; driving in downtown Seattle. As others have said â€“ the room was small. I found it to be plenty big enough for my purpose. See the photos. The bed was comfortable â€“ and the covers were warm enough even though very thin and light. Thatâ€™s saying something â€“ I tend to be cold at night. The closet it large and has a door. That is one of those little things that I really like. I donâ€™t like looking at a bunch of clothes hanging in the open closets. It also comes with a safe that was easy to operate. It was really nice to be able to lock up laptop when I was away from the room. Across from the closet is the tiny, tiny bathroom (see picture). I am not usually claustrophobic, but it is so small I did not feel comfortable with the door closed. The tub is another matter. I could not decide if the tub was just old and looked tired, or if it needed a good cleaning. Fortunately, my stay was brief enough I never had to actually use it. Look at the picture and decide for yourself. Expect a few quirks just from being it being an old building â€“ Example: the window did not seat 100% allowing some fresh air and a bit of street noise. Nothing that bothered me, but I overheard others complaining about it. Part of being an old building also means it is not good for those with mobility issues. You must go up or down about 7-10 steps to get to/from the elevator. Most people without limitations wonâ€™t be bothered by it. In the afternoon there is a complementary wine bar. That alone is a nice touch, but I was impressed as the manager is there and greets his guests personally and inquires as to how you are enjoying your stay â€“ and he actually wants to know! Too many managers lock themselves away in an office somewhere. There is a coffee place off the lobby â€“ a separate business, but connected so you can get your morning coffee/bagel without going out in Seattleâ€™s weather. Around the corner (same building) is Jasmine: It felt like a bar and had really good Asian foodâ€¦.but thatâ€™s another review. The Good: * Staff â€“ friendly, helpful * Manager â€“ goes out of his way to make sure his guests are happy (staff too) * Location â€“ Middle of downtown * Old building â€“ charm, details * Free wine social hour â€“ a great way to have a glass or two and unwind after a day of meetings while we decide how to spend the evening. The Bad: * Location â€“ too far (walking) from the main restaurant area, or waterfront. * Old building â€“ not accessible, showing its age * Questionable cleaning? Bottom line â€“ To be honest, I had mixed feelings about my stay - Iâ€™m still not sure if I would stay there again<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120184038">rooms clean, very central, excellent price, hospitable and friendly staff.

The rooms are a little small, but still comfortable, and clean, and the price was very respectable. The customer service was great at the front desk, the valet, and the ladies who cleaned the rooms (we always left the room a little disheveled, and returned to a spic and span room). I booked the room and then later called and asked if it had a tub, to which I was answered with a yes. Turns out, they hadn't actually checked or something because we checked into a room without a bathtub, but when we called down and mentioned our problem, they immediately switched us to a room with a tub at no extra cost to us. I'd definitely stay here again based on the customer service and location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119759658">I was in town for the weekend on business and found the hotel to be a marginally average place to stay if you will not be spending a lot of time in the room. I reserved their "deluxe suite" which was quite small (I'd hate to see what the standard room looks like, probably a closet). It was only manageable for a single traveler. The bed was comfortable and the TV had a nice array of channels. The bathroom was quite small as well and not built for someone over 5ft6. You cannot close the door without lifting up your knees if you are on the commode. The tub appeared to be stained which wasn't very nice to look at but the shower was nice. I found the heat/ac unit to be rather old and clunky. You cannot do much to control either. There is just a fan option. When I arrived the room was super hot and stuffy. The window only opens 6 inches (to prevent people from jumping since the room is so hot I assume) so it took a while for the room to air out and cool down. The front desk staff seemed rather aloof and disinterested in their customers as well. Do not use the vending machines in the hotel, they charge $2.00 for a can of soda!! Instead, take a walk to the Bartels drugstore just a few blocks south of the hotel and purchase beverages and snacks. On the bright side, the fabulous Seattle Public Library is right next door and there is decent WiFi in the room. This hotel is best for those who do not plan on driving since parking is expensive and minimal. One guest was given the incorrect parking instructions and was told he had to pay $87 for parking since the staff told him the wrong complex so beware if you are parking there, make sure you are given directions to the absolute correct complex. Also, Spring Street is a pretty vertical hill so if you are walking there from a Light Rail terminal, stay on 4th or 5th Ave to avoid having to walk up that crazy hill with your luggage. Other than that, it was an okay stay. I would only recommend this hotel if you do not plan on spending much time in the room, aren't brining a car, aren't too picky about temperature, are a single traveler on a budget, or enjoy walking up hills.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119728902">Was attending a Party at the Renaissance and stayed here instead of paying the $200+ for it.

Across the street from Seattle's beautiful public library and within a 10 min walk of Pike Place Market, this hotel is a great bet for the money. Just be sure to request a room that faces the street. We spent a stuffy first nite in an interior room that faced an algae-ridden AC unit on the back of the property. The room was tiny, hot, and had very little natural light. (No working AC.) l Needless-to-say, that was not okay. The next morning, I nicely asked the front desk folks to move us to a room with better circulation so we could stay cool and they put us in a spacious corner room at no extra cost. Just goes to show...it's always worth nicely asking for what you need.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119278720">Location is good and I wouldn't have minded the small rooms and older style building but my biggest complaint was the very thin walls. I find it so frustrating when hotels insist on putting all their guests together on one floor side by side when it's clearly a non busy time. Here's a thought spread out your guests so we don't have to hear each other flushing toilets at 5:30 am (especially if you install industrial toilets that you would find in a public washroom). I probably wouldn't return but if you are reading this for advice - ask for a quiet room away from other guests.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119207421">After reading the past reviews I was a little apprehensive on what to expect of this hotel... I booked a basic queen room through wotif.com for myself, partner and lil one, for just over $100 usd.. On arrival we asked for a free upgrade as we had heard that the rooms were on the smallish side, they obliged and gave us a king business room on the 7th floor. The room was good, big enough for us all and all of our luggage. The bed was super comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping at all... The bathroom was a tad small but it didn't really bother us too much!! The location is fantastic and you can walk to all the major attractions in the city - which was great for us as we only had a short time to see everything.

I have never heard such intimate details of what people staying next to me were up to as I have at the Executive Hotel Pacific. The couple next to us obviously waited to initiate intimacy until after the six o'clock CBS news, both of which I could hear clearly. The woman next door had such loud yelps and gasps of pleasure I felt like I was in the wrong by just being in my room. By two am I had had enough and when my roommate and I called to the front desk to ask to switch rooms they put us right next to the elevator, which we could also hear extremely clearly every time it was used for the rest of the night.

We therefore totally missed the complementary wine tasting offered in our deal and I forgot to enquire whether it was to be held. So, we basically used the room to sleep and for that it was ideal!!! 'Executive' to me conjures up an image of a business standard hotel that I would say the EP doesn't quite hit - the room wasn't massive, the window was broken and the bedlight was suspiciously intermittent.

The elevator was a huge problem, we had to wait so long for it and only one of the two elevators worked. The elevator would always take you down to the basement where the cleaning supplies are for no reason. Parking is in the building beside the hotel so you have to walk a little ways to get anywhere.

Overall, the reviews were very good and the location which is of utmost importance to us seemed excellent. It actually surpassed our expectations although the room was abit small. However, Seattle has so much to do that we were rarely in the room except to sleep. The staff could not have been nicer, the room was quiet and we were right across the street from the amazing library with buses (free from 6 AM to 7 PM) all around us. But since we are big walkers, we rarely took buses except occasionally since the hills are pretty steep getting back from the Waterfront. And the very elegant Fairmont was just one block away so this is in one of the finest neighborhoods in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117546112">My brother and I stayed for two nights in late August. I'd made the reservation for two people a few months before, and when he asked to bring my nephew, I called the 1-800 number to see if cots were available. "Yes," said the operator, "but let me connect you to the local hotel so you can have it ready for you." The local hotel contradicted this: "We don't have any cots, but we can give you extra blankets." Fine. He brought his own cot. We arrived early and checked our bags; check-in was uneventful and the bellhop was friendly and eager to help. I returned to the hotel to get keys several hours later; no problem. The room was small, as I expected, but in several places had paint chips coming off the walls. The hot and cold water on the sink was reversed. The window overlooking the library across the street was dusty and had gunk in the tracks. The frosted glass bathroom door had liquid marks at various heights. I don't want to wonder what the waist-level liquid marks came from. When my brother arrived, he called down for the blankets for the cot. "We don't have any," said the desk. A hotel without blankets? Really? Fine. We pulled the comforter off the bed and let my nephew use it on his cot. I was fine with just a sheet until about 2 AM. The air conditioning works really, really well. The next morning, I was the first one in the shower. The water was up to my shins when I finished -- it wouldn't drain a drop. I messed with the drain plug in the murky water, but couldn't get it to a point where I could hear any water draining out. My brother messed with it, using the drain plug as a plunger, and got it to drain slowly. Ewww for him. We called maintenance, who fixed it while we were out, but seriously, isn't that something that housekeeping would have noticed the last time they cleaned the tub? Unless they don't clean the tub... On the way out that morning, my brother stopped housekeeping and asked them for an extra blanket. They were happy to provide one. If the hotel has no extra blankets, as the front desk said, I wonder who in the hotel had to sleep without one that night. We ate breakfast at the Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs. They were as good as expected. The rest of the stay was uneventful. The front desk was happy to split charges across my brother's and my credit cards, and the bell desk was efficient at checking our bags again. It's really got the feel of a two-star place that might have been a three-star place many years ago. Knowing what I know now, I'd shell out a few extra bucks for somewhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117377497">We stayed at the Executive Hotel Pacific three days prior and one day post our Alaskan Cruise.

Upon our check in around 4 pm we discovered that there is no such thing as a "wine reception". They haven't started that program yet!!! False advertising...... Not that it's a huge deal, but c'mon...take it off the website. The room was pretty small, but really....we were only there to sleep. The bathroom was slightly larger than a medium closet. And there was no fan. Which is bizzarre. Maybe this is why a lot of the reviewers complain about the musty smell. Thanks to TA we brought a scented candle :) The bed was comfortable. Room temperature was perfect. We were supposed to have free wifi in the room, but alas.....there was no signal in the room. In the stairwell there was perfect reception, but not the room. In the morning i was able to pick up the Kimpton's signal from across the street. We complained three times about it. Apparently they rebooted the server, but that obviously didn't work. We had an iPad, iPhone and Blackberry...none of them were getting the hotel's signal. Not terribly impressed about that. But again...we were only there to sleep.

Built in 1928, the Pacific Executive Hotel has been restored to a wonderful level of comfort and has a Seattle's Best Coffee bar on its ground floor level. We selected the hotel as our starting point for our visit to the Pacific Northwest prior to our Alaskan cruise. The Hotel's location, it's nightly stay price point and it's website photos of the hotel were major factors for our choice of this property. We reserved two rooms online and got superb rates by navigating to the Manager's special section of their website. Our nightly room rate was $110.00 + tax and was a very good find for the location in the downtown of Seattle. The rooms were smartly decorated and took advantage of some of the historical features of the property like the vintage inset tiles in the floors of the bathrooms. Guests will find ample hot water in the bathrooms and the guest ammenities (towels, shampoos, soaps, etc.) were top quality. From the time of our arrival until our departure the staff provided friendly and attentive service. In conclusion, the Executive Hotel Pacific in the downtown of Seattle is a great find for those seeking a pleasant stay, at a historic property, without breaking their vacation budget.

The recommendations on here that decry the small rooms, smaller bathrooms, paper thin walls and slow elevators are accurate. The service was good though, very friendly.

My reservation was confirmed and there was no notification that the status of my reservation had changed at all, but when I attempted to check in the front desk informed me that the hotel was overbooked and there was no longer a room available for me. This is where the adventure started. The girls at the desk, without asking me first, made reservations for me at a different hotel and *informed me* that my only option was to spend the night at this different hotel. When I asked for more information about the new hotel, The 6th Avenue Inn, they proceeded to lie to every question I asked. I asked if it was of a comparable quality to their hotel, they said yes, of course. It's absolutely not - it's a budget hotel with peeling, paint, dirty carpets, and smells like urine. I asked if it was still in a downtown location, they said yes, it was only a few min away from the Executive Pacific. It is not, it's at least a 20 min walk away and in a completely different, run-down part of the city on the fringe of down town. I asked if it was still in a nice area with a nice view and restaurants and shops nearby - they said yes, it's a lovely hotel that's right in the heart of a bustling shopping area. It is not - my room overlooks a parking lot and a highway, and the only things next to this hotel are a police station and a McDonalds. They proceeded to whisk me into a cab, they women from the front desk said "Don't worry, we'll tell the cab driver where to drop you off" - the cab then dropped me off at the Pan Pacific hotel, who, when I tried to check in there, informed me they had no idea what I was talking about. The *very nice* staff at the Pan Pacific then called the Hotel Executive to figure out what the hell was going on, and then informed me that the cab took me to the completely wrong hotel. They were also nice enough to have their town car drop me off at the 6th Avenue Inn at no charge, and the driver even accompanied me into the lobby to make sure that I had arrived at the right location this time! The Pan Pacific was booked solid, which is too bad, because they were absolutely lovely and I would have just stayed there! Once I arrived at the 6th Ave Inn and discovered it was COMPLETELY NOT what had been described to me by the Pacific staff, nor was it in any way worth the price I was paying per night at the Pacific, I called the Pacific and said that at this point I was exhausted and very upset, and they really needed to do something to rectify the situation - I did not want to spend the night in a room that smelled like urine. (No offense, 6th AVE - I will say that the people at your front desk were also lovely and kind to me - It seems every hotel in Seattle has professional staff EXCEPT for the Hotel Pacific.... Hm.) The woman who answered the phone informed me that there were no supervisors at the hotel in the evenings (Excuse me??? Are you kidding me??). After some back and forth, she agreed to call her manager's cell phone, but he or she did not pick up so now I am stuck at the 6th Ave Inn, it's already 8:30pm (and my body thinks it's 11:30pm EST), and apparently I'm having dinner tonight at McDonalds. Welcome to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115496410">2 of our staff members were scheduled to stay at this hotel July 19th for a business meeting in downtown Seattle. A credit card authorization form was required. It was completed and included copies of the front and back of the corporate credit card. It was faxed as directed back to the hotel and we recieved a confirmation from our fax service that the transmission was successful ( 2 faxes so that both sides of the credit card read clearly). On the 18th of July we had not heard from the hotel and a number of calls were made to the hotel from the staff members themselves, and from the corporate office. No one ever called us back. We were told by the front desk that they did not have reservations and no rooms were available. They transferred our calls to another department that only had voice mail (that had a message stating that they would be out of the office June 17th through the 20th - a month old). Many messages were left, and we still haven't heard from anyone. This is just poor business. These staff members had a reservation, made in good faith, and guaranteed that the corporate card would pick up their charges. When that was provided, no call or email (which was not on ANY paperwork) have followed. We are disappointed and will not use this hotel again. Key Property Services, Inc.

We were right in the heart of everything. Walking distance to Space Needle and Pike's Market, and the start/finish of the Seattle Rock and Roll Marathon. The rooms were quaint, nothing special, but clean and nice. They have the older-style elevators which were fun and the lobby joins to a Seattle's Best Coffee Shop, which is convenient. It's a little inconvenient that the lobby and the entrance to the elevators are separated by about 10 steps, which means you have to drag your luggage up those steps to get to the elevator. Overall, not that big of a deal. The bell-hop, Stanley, was so helpful to us in pointing us toward the right eateries and attractions, so ask for Stanley!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115210003">While the bed was nice and I slept like the dead, the room itself was smaller than most walk in closets. In addition, the hotel has very little amenities. The only thing you can find is a Seattle's Best coffee shop in the lobbey. If you are looking for a hotel for a couple or with enough room for more than one piece of luggage - look elsewhere. Oh, and the parking was just too much. Park outside of town and take the light rail in.

But, given the location and the price, this place rises to the top. We stayed here twice in a little over a week--the night we arrived in Seattle, and the night before we flew out. Both nights, we had rooms that were clean, comfortable, and quiet. I agree that the rooms and the bathrooms are small. However, they were spotless, which to me is more important. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We had read some of the negative reviews and decided that, if our first visit wasn't satisfactory, we would go somewhere else for our second night. Needless to say, we didn't find that to be necessary.

The suite was small and the bathroom was even smaller and the fixtures and walls look so outdated and run down.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114416365">We chose to book this hotel even though it wasn't the cheapest, because the name "Executive" lends itself to a certain standard that the cheaper hotels didn't have. While the lobby, bell hop, and front desk area were all well polished, the elevator was completely dodgy (mis-matched buttons, jerky and rickety and VERY noisy, the doors opened before you were at your floor, etc) and the rooms were pretty average. While the finishings and overall appearance of the rooms was nice, the crown moulding was about 1/2 inch away from the ceiling, the toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom was at eye level when you are on the toilet, the bathroom itself had a glass door to the bedroom, not a wooden door (not bad, just weird). In the hallways, the wallpaper was peeling off the wall and all of the trim work was well dented and scratched. We were on the 8th (top) floor, and during the night it was almost unbearable with the noise from the elevator. Though we were on the opposite end of the floor from the elevator, the noise kept us up most nights. The hotel also placed us in a room with a door going through to an adjoining room, but did not consult us if this was okay before doing so. Let me tell you: it was NOT okay - the walls and door were so paper-thin that we could hear the neighbour sneezing, drawing their shower curtain and talking quietly. I think the problem with this hotel is that the building was so old and try as they might to give it facelifts to make it an "Executive" hotel, it falls very short of executive status. We would not stay at this hotel again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114364854">Only a short walk to the Pike Market and The Waterfront.

There is a Seattle's Best in the hotel, and other hotels on either corner for more substantial meals. It's an old hotel with 8 floors and only 2 elevators. Shortly after we arrived and were assigned our room on the 8th floor, both elevators broke. The desk clerk reassigned us to a larger room on the 2nd floor since we had to take the stairs to our room, and the bell captain was great helping us move our luggage. All in all, we were pleased with the hotel for the price. One tip, DON'T TAKE THEIR SHUTTLE. It costs twice as much as a taxi ($16 to the wharf for 2), and you have to go with them to drop off other passengers at their destination. A taxi is only $8, and takes you directly there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113090475">My friend and I came to Seattle to see a concert, and this location was perfect for walking to the event. But we found the hotel to be a little run down - broken lock on window, no shower fan, had to call to get shampoo (conditioner was there) and coffee (only had bags of decaf in the room), bathroom tile lacking molding, tub crinkled when you stood in it for a shower, and just a general need for more paint and care throughout the room.

The staff is friendly, but doesn't make up for the poor condition of the hotel itself. To start off with, you have to either go up steps or down steps to get to the elevator so forget about using a cart to take your luggage to your room. The rooms are small and furniture is shabby. The walls are very thin and rooms noisy. In the bathroom in my room, you can't put the toilet lid up without it hitting the handle to flush the toilet so you have to kind of sit down and lean forward so the lid doesn't go back and hit the handle or you have an instant bidet.

Free Wi-Fi and printer access was a plus. The room and bathroom was very clean and I felt was spacious relative to the price and the area we were staying. My wife and I reserved a hotel reservation using an online special in March 2011 for a great rate. We planned to stay here on the way back from an Alaskan cruise so we could see downtown before catching our plane back home through SEA-TAC airport. I called a few weeks ahead of time to confirm and even received an automated e-mail 2 days before hand confirming our stay. However, when we arrived they could not find us with the e-mail printout reservation number or by our last name. At first I panicked, because the hotel was very full and I was concerned I was going to be stuck going somewhere else for 3X the price given that the summer season had just started. I am not sure exactly what happened (computer glitch?) but the staff was very patient and worked hard to find a room for us. We ended up checking in a little later but we got a complementary shuttle to the airport the next morning (normally $35-$40 from downtown) and upgraded to a king size bed. A mixup like this could happen anywhere, but what is important is if it does how the problem is handled.

They gave me some excuse about the boiler was off or something like that. Tried the old junky air unit by the window which had no effect. Tried to open the window but it was limited to just a few inches, so no one can jump out due to heat stroke.

The University St SoundLink light rail station is only a block away which is convenient for traveling to/fro SeaTac airport. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and was promptly checked in on the 4th floor in a smallish room but it was clean and looked quite modern. Not a bad look for an older style building. They are currently renovating the 5th floor and 1 of the elevators. The current elevators are old and pretty slow and I found myself running the stairs most times but that would not be practical if you were on a higher floor or had luggage. The lobby and mezzanine level with the free business centre looks great. I went downstairs and asked the front desk for some dining out suggestions for the Sunday night and they had no ideas for me, suggested I order pizza delivery.

Haven't been back since, and won't be back, but I remember my impression of the hotel vividly. The website fooled me with it's shiny and well kept-looking photos. This hotel is definitely old, and is definitely in serious need of a thorough update. It would be a pretty cool boutique hotel if this were to happen. My room was around the corner from the elevator, and the noise from that was literally constant. It's true the walls are paper thin. We could practically make word for word of our neighbors conversation. Either it's literally been ages since the walls have been washed, or the no-smoking rule is not enforced, but there was a stuffy, smokey, mushroomy stench throughout the entire hotel. The room, and bathroom, did NOT feel clean and were SO tiny. I was expecting to take a pack of bed bugs home with me. My biggest issue was with the headboard... It was a faux leather material, with huge scratches/gauges scraped throughout, which was pretty sketchy to me. I also had an excellent view of a neighboring concrete building, with an alley of dumpsters below. (If concrete is an unappealing view for you, beware of hotels with online photos of their rooms with the blinds/drapes closed... big red flag!) I personally like things bright, spacious, charming, and clean. If you do too, this is not the hotel for you. It is not at all luxurious. The location is pretty good and central (being from Seattle it's not the location I would want, but close enough), and of course the prices are great for downtown.

It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places.

Of course I spoke to them and shut them up, but the point is the hotel is so old, the walls are 'paper thin'. Our room also faced 4th Ave and the street noise was quite loud. We could not sleep with the window open as a result but even when closed the sounds were loud. A little money spent soundproofing is in order. Our room with two double beds was also quite small and short of space. But again, it is an older hotel. The staff are all wonderful, and the location great, but your money is better spent elsewhere.

Donâ€™t go expecting anything fancy but the location is wonderful and the rooms are fine. However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldnâ€™t sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise. I cannot fathom why they do not rent this room sparingly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100784582">This was my second time staying at this hotel; I travel to WA every few months for business and will not be staying at this hotel again. Not that it was the worst place Ive ever stayed, but as a solo female traveler I didn't feel comfortable. The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up. When I notified an attendent my vehicle had been broken in to and items stolen he just shrugged and walked away.

My inexperience as a hotel picker was quickly apparent when we finally arrived in our room after having to walk around the block from the parking garage to the hotel lobby because it doesnt lead into the hotel at all. Lucky for us we were just staying for one night so we packed lightly. We walked into the room and noticed it was recently remodled yet extremely small. There was no table like you see in most hotels. All of this I can deal with but the single worst thing about this place is that the walls are virtually non-existent. My neighbors were not being too loud however you can hear people talking at a normal level. You can hear every toilet flush in the rooms around you. This is not good for a light sleeper such as myself. I guess if your a partier and want to go stay out all night and need a bed to come pass out in then this place might work. I guess the one good thing to come out of this is that now I know that you get exactly what you pay for.

The price was great, especially for the location - the rooms are small, however if you don't plan on spending much time in them, it shouldn't be a problem. The beds were comfortable, more so than the average hotel room. The only downside is you can hear everything happening in the hallway, so if you attempt to sleep in you'll be woken by a vacuum at 8 a.m. Luckily the other guests staying here were respectful, and we rarely heard them. The staff were friendly and constantly helpful, they allowed us to check in early before we hit the stores. Parking was right next door to the hotel, and only $21 - which I think is a good deal for downtown seattle. I'm suprised travellers are shocked that they must pay for parking at a hotel - it's pretty standard in large cities where parking is at a premium.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR96925429">First of all, the room was so small. I expected it to be cozy, and properly equipped, but it was neither. There was no table to eat at.. just a desk. In-room meals had to be eaten on the bed, or over one's lap. The staff graciously upgraded my family to a "King-Size Suite" which just consisted of a larger bed.. (which in turn made the room even smaller). The Bedding was stained, the staff didn't clean the room until I personally requested it.. TERRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I opted for valet service, and for the extra charge, I think it would have been better to have just self-parked. Why in the world would a guest at a hotel have to pay to park there?! The staff did NOT help us with our bags, even though we obviously had our hands full, there was no ramp so all luggage had to be transported manually. The elevator took at least 5 minutes to get to the floor, and its button didn't work half the time. The doors on the elevator nearly crushed me, as they do not have safety sensors.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR96924201">If you want a hotel right in midtown this is it.

Everyone from the concierge, front desk to even the maid service were all so friendly, helpful and very personable!!

Luckily the window opens a bit - fresh air was great, city noise was not. Comfortable bed, but room wasn't super-clean. Free internet was definitely a big plus.

But my floor reeked of mold from the broken ice machine, the "air conditioning" couldn't bring the room temp down a single degree, and the window opened only a fraction, so sleep was hard to come by. Other issues: - Mattress was well past its prime, you could feel the springs through the top foam - Room was very small, bathroom awkwardly small - Tub didn't drain properly - No desk to write at (odd for a hotel named Executive) Water pressure was good, and staff did their best with what they have been given. Mgmt needs to invest in the infrastructure though. I'm going to ask my company to take this hotel off its list of preferred vendors when I get home. Lots of overseas visitors -- it makes me sad that this is their first stop. If your budget is counted out to the pennies, and you plan to do no work in the hotel room, just sleep there, and you don't mind a room temp closer to 80 than 60, and you aren't allergic to mold, might be your best option in this part of $town$.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR83252879">the negatives: -the A/C turns on but does not actually work...(it was too warm in our room and the window only opens a little bit) -when you turn the A/C off it still kind of makes noise...(bring ear plugs) -the clock radio had a connection for your MP3 which was GREAT...but the wire was split so it would constantly turn on/off...so that was kind of a bummer. -the view, sucked...(but we weren't there for the view) -the walls were thin; you could hear your neighbors...(again, bring ear plugs) -the bathroom door did not close - the only way it will close is if you lock it... -there was no fan in the bathroom... -the light wasn't working near the bed but after leaving a note for house keeping they fixed it... the positives: -it was clean -the bed was very cozy -the staff seemed friendly -a coffee shop is connected to the hotel so you can get a fresh cup of joe first thing in the morning -good location<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR82918401">This hotel room is average in every respect.

I had read reviews online before booking and read mostly positive comments so I thought we'd try it. I booked two nights online and got a $10 itunes giftcard when I checked in! The hotel is in a great location for walking around downtown. It was very clean and the staff was nice and helpful. The room was very comfortable, too. The room and the bathroom were on the smaller side (okay, they were small) but it was fine for us. We wanted to stay downtown and were on a budget. I was happy with the room and the location. My only complaint would be the a/c. I called the front desk and was told that it may take some time to cool off since it hadn't been on long. I turned it on and the room would not cool off. It was on all night and only moved the air around a little without getting much cooler. The next day I saw that housekeeping had a fan and we asked if we could use it. That night we opened the window (I thought they didn't open the first night) and had the fan pulling in the cool air and we slept great. I think this is a great option if you want to be within walking distance of the market, Pioneer Square, shopping downtown, etc. There are several trendier hotels nearby but they are also going to be a lot more expensive. This is an older hotel but I think they've done a good job updating it and making it look nice and stay comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and would just make sure I asked for a fan when I checked in or when I made the reservation.

We were able to take turns popping into the Seattle's Best coffee shop next to the lobby to get our coffee/breakfast sandwiches and relax in the living area with hotel-provided newspapers, breakfast, and a relaxed doggy on the floor. There wasn't enough room in our hotel room to spread out like this, and without the nice living room area, we would have had to take the dog out to car so that we could go eat. The self-park is very convenient for people want to keep their dog in the car while they go out to eat, etc. Some places only offer valet parking, which can be inconvenient if you are using your car as a dog kennel. It's nice, safe, clean, friendly, and cheap. I like the Monaco Hotel across the street, but at a hundred dollars less a night, the Executive Hotel is a better deal. Oh, one odd thing: the counter/shelf was about 1/4 inch too low... the toilet seat hit it when in the lifted position. Inconvenient for a man to have to hold it up the whole time. Bring a piece of tape... haha. No other problems with the bathroom though. We stayed on the 4th of July, by the way.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR70226639">This hotel was right in the middle of everyrhing. We never had to drive anywhere!

The hotel had multiple issues that I wouldn't have expected for something that is advertised as "luxury and boutique". The room was very small, 2 full beds (not queen), no table, no chair, basically nowhere to set your things. The bathroom was the same. The single 6" wide shelf was over the toilet, so you really didn't want to set personal hygiene items there. None of the vending machines worked, leaving you to have to walk 8 blocks to get something to drink at night. The air conditioner couldn't keep up. The tub didn't drain properly, leaving you standing in 6" of water. On the converse, the front desk and valet staff were VERY nice. Unfortunately, they have to deal with the lack of concern that management must have about the property. I would probably not stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR67705473">We booked this hotel for 2 nights and left after the first only because it was pre-paid and we could not find another hotel. The room smelled like a gym locker. The bathroom looked 'reasonably' clean, but the tub needed replacing.... When I stepped into the tub the floor of the tub felt 'sloshy' and it had several cracks. As your moved around in the tub it felt like there was water beneath it and it was sloshing around. I think there was water under there - old, rotten, diseased bath water. The bath drain would not stay in open position so that made it worse. The bad thing is that we could of booked another 5 star hotel for about $5 dollars more over by the space needle, but we were not familiar with that area. I would check the room pryor to signing any papers and I would not pre-pay for rooms in this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR66812781">I don't like to complain, but I can't help it with this one. I really didn't enjoy my stay, but I was trying to find a reasonable rate in a prime location, during a peak season. It's true what they say... you get what you pay for. So I will start with the positive... The hotel's location is price. Nestled on the corner of 4th and Spring, this property is conveniently located to almost everything. This is what I wanted, and this is what I got. The price was right for the location and peak season. I don't think I could have found anything cheaper in the area. I paid about $170.00 including self parking. I love old, historical-ish buildings with character. This is for sure an old building and there is character. Too bad things aren't kept up a little better. The bed was very comfortable, but I'm not giving too much credit here because most hotels have comfy beds these days. The connecting restaurant, Jasmin was nice. Although I didn't eat here, I did enjoy the bar. And that's about all I can say positive. Now for the not-so-great. When I arrived it was obvious the parking was terrible. I was pleased to have prepaid for parking. I pulled up in front of the hotel, as I usually do when valet parking is offered, and there were not curb-side spots. I double parked and turned on my flashers, waiting for the attendant. The sign says to ask the attendant for parking instructions, but there was no attendant to be found. I waited for nearly 15 minutes before I called the front desk, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes before I hung up. I called back and asked if they could send out a parking attendant. I was advised he was parking cars... it should be noted that not a single car was moved during the 20+ minutes I sat out front, double parked. When the parking attendant came out, he got my name and took my car away; that's all that was said, He didn't even offer to help with my bags. I'm not a fan of tipping parking attendants when the price of parking in the city is so high anyway, but he for sure wasn't getting a tip. When I went in to the desk, there was one young man and he was incredible busy. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the lobby, but the phones were crazy. It took another 15 minutes for me to get checked in because he had to keep putting me on hold to answer the phone. And while he was nice, he was in a lose-lose situation. Not to mention, he had a visible arm tattoo. I have tattoos and I love them, but I felt it was inappropriate for a front desk clerk to have one visible. On an up note, I wasn't aware my rate included SELF-park and not valet. If there had been a parking attendant out front when I arrived, maybe I could have realized this. But the attendant just came to my car, asked my name, and drove away. I was used to this and he didn't ask me if I had valet or self park. When I was checking in, it was discovered that I had used valet services but only paid for self park. The tattooed desk clerk was nice enough to upgrade me at no additional charge for the misunderstanding. When I got in to the elevator, the walls were fabric that was worn and looked very dirty. I'm sure it was clean, but it didn't look like it. On my way to my room, there was a painter in the hall painting the baseboards. He didn't make any effort to move aside, and the hallways are pretty narrow. So I went around. When I arrived in my room, the first thing I noticed was how small the bathroom was. I have a thing for bathrooms, and this was small, cute, and charming. And again, while I'm sure it was clean, there were areas I questioned. The grout in between the little tiles on the floor was dingy and appeared to be dirty. I think this is from lack of maintenance. Also, there was a vertical pipe along the wall; at the base of the pipe there appeared to be something that looked like insulation or something, only it was tattered and painted over; it looked really gross. The wood baseboards were sort of torn up (again, lack of maintenance), but they had been painted over. Newsflash... painting over tattered wood doesn't clean up the look of the wood; it only becomes painted tattered wood. Like the fabric in the elevator, the carpet looked dingy and dirty. The room was small, but sufficient for one person, sorta crowded for two. What really upset me were the window shears. One window was above the air conditioner (which was loud) and when I went over to turn the air on, I noticed black spots at the bottom of the shears. I can only assume this was mold, give the look and the location. Also, the headboard was a padded feaux leather-type material that was all worn and scratched up. Not attractive at all. And while I don't frequent the honor bar items, I had forgotten my tooth brush and craved some saltiness in the middle of the night. Things were expensive, as they go with honor bars, but the products still weren't great quality. It seemed like the entire honor bar was stocked from bulk items from Costco. The noise in the hallway and neighboring rooms was loud for a weeknight; I would imagine a weekend night would be worse. And when I checked out, it took the valet another 15 minutes to bring my car around; there were no other people waiting. When he finally got there with my car, I loaded my luggage, again... he didn't offer to help, and he had the nerve to "linger" as if he was expecting a tip. Sorry, buddy, but I just paid nearly 30 bucks for parking one night; if you wanna tip, you're gonna have to take care of my bags. This was one night; I had a second night scheduled here a few days later. Let's just say, this hotel left an impression on me... one that caused me to call and cancel my second night and rebook at another in the same area. I paid more at my new place, but it was worth it. The moral of the story... when you pay budget, expect a budget product.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR66476870">Rooms are very small, bathroom is so small and old, that it felt dirty.

The first time I was charged about $150/night. The second time $71/night. The $71 rate is about what this hotel is worth. The location is great if you're a business traveler, or even for most tourists. It's a little off the shopping drag, but centrally located if you're also going to visit the aquarium, Chinatown, Pioneer Square, and the other things there are to do in Seattle. But the hotel, itself isn't great. It's like it was a crappy hotel that someone really wanted to upgrade, but only just started before having to stop. Certain things don't go together. Flat screen TVs: good. Peeling paint: bad. Internet access: good. Carpet stains: bad. I would stay here again if I was a single business traveler trying to save a buck. Would I bring my wife here? Heck, no! Not that it's not safe. But much of the hotel is simply worn out. Housekeeping tries really hard to fight back against the grime and does an admirable job. But you can only hold back the tide of funk for so long. There's a great Seattle's Best attached to the lobby, and a Starbucks across the street. Free wifi at Seattle's Best and throughout the hotel. Starbucks wifi is free if you have AT&amp;T DSL service or an iPhone. One note for anyone who has difficulty getting around -- avoid this hotel. You must navigate a set of stairs to get from any of the entrances to the elevators.

In this hotel almost nothing is provided for you. The rooms are cramped and honestly being a larger sized person not in girth but in height I wasn't sure if I could even fit. The shower was atrocious for me mainly because the shower-head was chest level for goodness sake and wasn't adjustable. The parking was terrible mainly because there was very little in the way of that. The hotel provided maybe 6 parking spots for 9 floors of guests. NOT WORTH IT. I was staying on the fifth floor and lemme tell you waiting for the elevator was terrible it must have been built in the 1960's or something but it ran....very slowly and I was always worried about the thing because it creaked when you went up or down in it. The weight room they provide isn't even a weight room....actually unless you are told where the heck it is you won't even be able to find it. I overheard the front desk person say it was on the second floor but i went to check where it was and all i found were hotel rooms. My uncle and I stayed there for I believe 3-4 days and on the very first night my card key STOPPED WORKING!!!!

Beautiful weather (surprisingly), and a fabulous location for the work I was doing, but the hotel lurched between quirky and decrepit (and occasionally sullenly incompetent) depending on my mood... The entrance area is split across three levels, which require either a downstairs drag or an upstairs hike with your luggage (the porter can be seen running away into the left luggage room as you approach). The reception is polite but unhelpful as they don't really cater for the sort of needs travellers may have (Power adapter? No. Stamps? Of course not). They issue two room cards despite there being only me, and they had actually booked out four rooms for a total of 16 nights for us (though this may not be their fault). The rooms are definitely small, especially by American standards, but would it really have hurt to provide a suitcase stand to help out with the squeeze? The bathroom was a very tight fit (and I am tall and felt I had to concertina up to sit down), but more or less functional. The 'robe' provided would barely have covered my modesty if I could have got it around my shoulders (more like a souvenir tea towel), and I wonder if this is a favourite trick of hotels to save themselves doing a bit of laundry. Did they not notice they had put a size 0 robe in a big man's room? Had a great view of the Koolhuis Library next door, and was across the hall from the very small 'Cardio Room' that has one running machine, one cross trainer and one stationary bike, as well as the ubiquitous television set that Americans can't seem to operate without. Free WiFi didn't function for most of my stay. Had a couple of drinks in the downstairs bar, but having to call the lift and struggle with its doors (both opening and closing) is a bit ridiculous when you are only on the second floor. The internal decor of Jasmine's bar is for seventies glam nostalgics only, and if you were there then, it is likely that if you left anything tucked under the sofas it is probably still there. American service always amuses me because they promise so much (and so cheerfully) and delivers so little (with serious expressions that suggest the end of the world could not be put off quite long enough to do you the service they said they would). In general, despite an apparently recent multi-milllion pound refit, this place gives the impression of a run down flop house, with a blind interior decorator getting the gig. It doesn't need to be this way, and the management should get their act together, especially considering the quality of the local competition.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR27036702">Moderately priced hotel room right in the downtown area. Across the street from the Main Public Library which is an architectural gem and within walking distance of Pike Place Market and a lot of other attractions. Nice thing about the hotel is that it is not an anonymous chain. On the down side, the rooms are somewhat smaller and it lacks the amenities of the larger hotels - minibar, etc - but there is a nice cozy feeling about the place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR26036243">Not even sure where to start...there were so many disappointing things. The description of the hotel read "boutique" and it is the farthest thing from that. I felt as though I was in Europe again staying in a hostel. The walls are paper thin!!!!! The bathroom was so small, that I could not set any of my toiletries even in the bathroom. Unable to close the toilet seat due to the handle being in the way....great engineering and planning! The biggest thing was the constant cigarette smoke that seeped into our room from the hallway and room next door. After putting up with this two nights in a row, we finally moved to a different room on another floor...only to have the door handle fall off right in our hands!!! I have to say I was disappointed in the way the hotel handled our disappointments. They didn't even comp us one night!!! Never again!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22556236">Stayed here for a long weekend. We got a good deal on the room price ($110.00/night) for the location. The a/c did not work and we had to prop the window with a sturdy book. The window was very heavy. I noticed other patrons were creative in their window-propping; a wooden coat-hanger for example. The bathrooms were nice with marble vanity etc. Other reviews complained of the smallness of the bathrooms, but we found this to be okay. Clean with good soaps, shampoos. Easy walk to Underground Tour and Pike's Market. Staff were real nice and let us check in early on a rainy day. The airport bus (Grey Line) shuttled right around the corner which was very convenient. Free WiFi!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20446140">We stayed here because it was part of a block booking for a conference. Our experiences were similar to those of other reviewers, i.e. small rooms with dreary decor, mostly indifferent front-desk service, and noisy (very noisy if, like us, you get an inward-facing room overlooking the kitchen air con units!). On the positive side, the tiny bathroom was spotlessly clean and the shower was excellent. Plus the bed was really comfortable. Yes, the hotel is in a reasonably convenient downtown location, but that barely makes up for the downsides. If like us you simply need a place to put your head down for the night, and are likely to spend the rest of your time out and about in Seattle, then this modestly-priced hotel should suffice for a few nights. But there aren't enough creature comforts to make you want to stick around and relax in it during the day or evening. After 5 nights we were certainly glad to be moving on.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20356370">I stayed in this hotel, with a friend, over the weekend of the 19th-21st September. I had stayed there before and recommended my friend book on the basis of my last stay, which was reasonable. But that was definitely not the case this time around. There were so many disappointing things about our weekend at the Executuve Hotel Pacific........ 1.We were placed in a room directly opposite the elevators on the 5th floor. The noise from the elevators and other guests returning home until the early hours of the morning was very loud (and i am usually a heavy sleeper, and i could still hear it clearly , on and off, throughout the night). Also the cleaning staff made such a racket in the morning it was difficult to sleep past 7am. 2.We made a specific online request to have a small fridge in the room for medications. This was obviously ignored online, as were our pleas to have something done about it when we checked in. Previously, in other similar hotels, we were offered a small portable fridge/cooler for the exact same purpose. 3. The air conditioning did "work" (ie turn on) but produced a worrying, burning smell when it was turned on (as if it had not been used for weeks). So we tried to open the window which was stuck down, so we could only open in a few cm to try and let some cool, fresh air into the now stuffy room. 4. The bathroom was small, but the size itself wasn't the main issue. The shower head had virtually no pressure and the toilet was VERY, VERY noisy every time we flushed (and we could hear the toilets of adjacent rooms quite clearly too). Very old, poor plumbing. 5. When we suggested to the front desk staff that they should move us because of all of the above reasons, they said they were fully booked for our first night but could change our rooms for the second night. We agreed. When we presented to the front desk for our new room the next day, the new staff member stated nothing had been documented in their book about a room change, and again they were booked out so they could not help us. In fact, they freely admitted that they had just used up the last room for the guest who checked in minutes before, and they had overbooked...so they still had to find rooms for 4 guests who had yet to check-in. Not something that i imagine a reputable hotel does(or admits to their other guests!). So all up, we were glad to check-out and will not be returning to this hotel. Next time we will gladly pay a few extra dollars for a decent hotel room and some service!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20254927">I was very disappointed with my stay at this hotel. When I booked I let them know that it was for a Bridal Shower from 6pm-11pm and asked if they had any restrictions, quiet hours, etc. They said "no" and that it would be just fine, so I booked (2) rooms. Upon arriving and checking into our rooms we noticed that we could hear every word said next door...the walls were paper thin! Noise was a definite problem and I would not have booked here if they had been honest with me as I had been with them about the purpose of our stay. They could have done so much to avoid the situation by putting us in a corner or end room as I book (2) suites! I talked to a hotel representative letting her know my disappointment since I had arranged this ahead of time but also my understanding of other guests since the hotel did not plan well and asked it we could be moved, etc. She responded very annoyed and was not open to any resolution besides us going to sleep....it was around 9:50pm on a Saturday night and we had about an hour left of our shower. To make matters worse both rooms that we stayed in were prank called. From 1am-3am the phones would ring and when we would answer it was just hold music. These calls could not have come from guest rooms (we tried calling each other) as the guest room phones did not have a hold button. It got so bad that we had to unplug the phones but needless to say that we did not get any sleep. When I asked at checkout if they had been having any troubles with their phones they said they were working just fine. Granted I have no proof that the hotel made these calls, but it seems very unlikely that both our rooms would have this problem and that hold music would be in the back ground. Also, the next morning at 9:15am a maid banged on our door asking when we were leaving....check out wasn't until 11am. Overall if you want to pay $250 for a place to sleep where there is no customer service what so ever, then this is the hotel for you. Otherwise I recommend staying away and spending your money where you will be taken care of properly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20175021">We recently stayed at this hotel for a weekend trip. Overall, the hotel was just alright, as the location is fairly convenient, but after saying that, if you find any hotel in the downtown area, it will be convenient. The hotel is clean, the staff is pretty friendly, and the rooms are very small, especially the bathroom, which was terribly small. Our air conditioning unit wasn't barely working and it was pretty loud at night. The elevators are very slow as well. I am not sure if there is free wireless internet service but there is one computer for public use.

My husband and I stayed here over the weekend and found that the location of the hotel is wonderful, if not perfect. The condition of the hotel is, however, far from perfect. The headboards had tears in them, the bathroom was less than sanitary feeling, the room was rather small, and the paint was coming off of the baseboards in places. I feel like there were cosmetic changes that could have been made to make the room more appealing without spending a lot of money on the part of the hotel. Nonetheless, the beds were great, the tv was nice and conveniently placed, and the feel was nothing less than hisotric Seattle. If you are expecting something breathtaking I don't recommend this hotel.

You can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room next door, all night we could hear the couple next door having sex, it was horrible. I accidently left a dress still with tag on in the closet and when I called the next day to have them hold it for me, they said it was no longer there and housekeeping checked the closet and never found it...liars and thieves!!! Also, I needed to get my cell phone which I left in my car, the valet service offered to go get it, which was VERY nice, HOWEVER, the guy left my light on and caused my battery to die, which in turn took the valet 30 minutes to get my car once we needed it in the morning.

Definately NOT worth the sticker price!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19029974">We stayed here from Aug. 13 to 16, 2008 and was given the third room from the elevators on the 7th floor. On the whole, the stay was OK and I would come back again. That said, there are things which irked me and could/needs to be improved for sure. Rooms: Clean, older, and pretty small. Best suited for a couple. Bathroom: Very small (probably the smallest sink I have ever encountered). but clean. On the plus side, the shower heads worked well and there were no mould or cracks. On the minus side, there is very little counter space and I can see the bathroom being a tight squeeze for larger individuals (I'm pretty tiny at 5 feet 2 and 115 lbs) Noise: The walls are very thin indeed - we had a baby next door and heard it crying into the night. If you are lucky enough to have quiet neighbours, then things should be OK. We could also hear the hum of the elevators (this is not constant, but occasional), but this did not bother us too much (if you can sleep through the hum of an airconditioner for example, then it should not be no problem). Amenities: Room had a good size TV and a clock radio which you could plug your Ipod into. There's free wireless Internet in rooms (a computer is also available in the sitting/lobby area for those without personal laptops). There is a cardio room and Seattle's Best Coffee outlet just downstairs connected to the hotel. Location: Fabulous and very central to Pioneer Square, Pine/Pike Street, Waterfront, Chinatown, Pike Place - all within walking distance. Please also check out the modern Seattle Public Library building across the street - not listed in any tourist guide, but absolutely beautiful - go to the third and 10th floors in particular. Hotel: Lobby areas are nice, although external looks old. Valet Parking: $19 per day (not including taxes) Overall, our stay was good. I was very wary at first and nearly did not book this hotel after reading reviews (I'm pretty particularly about cleanliness and location), but can't complain too much having stayed there for three nights.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18744321">we stayed in the hotel while we had four days in Seattle between July 25 and July 29. It was the only one available when we booked through United vacations. Other unavailable possibilities are located close by. My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the "Tower of Terror" ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift. The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere. You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel. There are some good restaurants within two or three blocks, because the hotel only has a coffee shop. We fell in lucky, we were in Seattle on the night of the excellent Torchlight procession (unintentionally). There's 900,000 people live in Seattle, and half of them must have been in the procession! The people are nice and friendly, the trips we had were excellent, but the next time we go to Seattle, we won't be staying at the Exec Pacific -- unless the owners put their hands in their pockets and pay for a much needed major refurbishment. It's a waste of an excellent location in a friendly city.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18439082">Read the majority of the negative comments that shold tell you something. Its a early 1900 building that had some new carpet, and some marble in the front entrance and there you are. There is NO access for a whhelchair. You park out front and load your luggage in the hotel taking it down some stairs a placing it on a cart and hoping on an old clanky elevator. Once your done, you have to drive the car to a public parkade in the next building over. Its unfornate that you can not drive under the building and unload the car and have an elevator take you to your floor. The bathroom was smaller than small, the rooms we tiny, and carpet had a stain, and an electrical wire that was sheathed and screwed to the wall came off the wall. The door to the room had a deadbolt (thankfully), however, the old style manual slider lock with a chained piece that was connected to the wall was broken off and made me wonder if this room was recently broken into? The building should be knocked down and a new one constructed. Anyhow, its not worth what we paid. Its in an okay location, but in my opinion is a 2 star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18288458">Here it is- the definitive evidence to illustrate how small the rooms are at The Executive Hotel- see pics The bathroom does not hold my personal travel trophy for tiny but it is small and if you are pressed for time then while you are on the 'throne' you could soak your feet at the same time. The room is small too but fine for two people. I only bristle at the $196.00 price per night when I glance up and see huge cracks that cut across the length of the ceiling as well as water stains and peeling paint.

It's an older, refurbished hotel so, yes, the rooms are small, but they're livable. Plus there's an open "living room" area on the Mezzine that has free wi-fi, so if you do need room to stretch you can do it there. The bed was very comfortable and I found the rooms and hallways to be very quiet. I think the older construction actually helps in this case. Unlike the newer hotels that are basically metal and cinder block, the Hotel Pacific actually seems to have thick insulated walls. It's also within good walking distance of shopping and Pike's Market. I was in town for a conference and it was about a 10 minute walk to the Convention Center. The drawbacks? A crotchety elevator that stopped working once or twice and the hotel could use a good scrubbing from top to bottom. While the rooms were generally clean (the curtain sheers could use a washing) I'm currently looking at a visible layer of dust on the light fixtures in the hotel lobby. Not a deal breaker but they should break out a ladder and take care of details like that.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16950722">we had a quick one night stopover in seattle on our way to vancouver. we chose this hotel as it was recommended in lonely planet.

The rack rate charged by the hotel is insane considering I could have gotten a decent motel/lodge for half the price.

The bathroom is no different. Good luck sitting on the toilelt. You need to be aware of surroundings. As soon as you sit down and sit upright, you feel a sharp pain as the bathroom sink enbed's inteself into your left shoulder blade!

Location is quite central and about 10 min away to Pike Place. Another 15 min to Chinatown. And under 10 min away to downtown shopping. Space Needle area will require a cab, but monorail is walking distance. The funky Capitol Hill shouldn't be more than 10 min drive away and some consider it even a walking distance. Parking was included and is in parkade in the building next door. Internet consisted of one computer and getting the chance to get on it is hit and miss... more likely 'miss' unless you get up nice and early.

Don't worry - we see you. When I saw my room, now THAT was the shocker - old, run down, and most importantly, DIRTY. The grout between the tiles on the bathroom floor was black and mucky. The floor of the shower was filthy with "foot dirt". Even the robe hanging in the closet had STAINS running down the front of it! They should be embarrassed at the lack of hygiene in this place - maybe it's "alternative" to sleep in a filthy bed, but back in the '80s we did that for free, not for $150 a night. I complained at the front desk and was shown an "upgrade" room which was much bigger, but also had a dirty tub, and a filthy bathroom floor. When I pointed this out to the bellman, he said "Well, it's an old building." Pointing to some RECENT black fingerprint smudges on the closet door, I said, "Lots of buildings are old - this is a DIRTY building - I could take that off right now with some 409." I got out of there ASAP and found a CLEAN, big room in nearby Issaquah where the walls are thick enough that I don't have to hear my next door neighbor using the toilet (sorry to be gross).

The front-desk lady knew EVERYTHING about Seattle and how to get around. Free wireless Internet is also a huge bonus! The room was a little small, but there were only two of us staying there and we like to be close. But for those of you who need space, you may want to go for one of those hotel chain suites.

Upon check-in, we were advised that parking would be an additional charge of $19/day. We were then given a "superior" room on the top floor and were greeted by a cracked and peeling ceiling, dirty walls and baseboards, and a run down bathroom. We complained to the front desk and were able to switch rooms. The only improvement in the second room was that there was actually a dresser and the ceiling was in better shape. But we took it. Let me restate, the bathroom alone is reason not to stay at this hotel. All of the fixtures were ancient, despite the sites' claims of a recent renovation. The tile was also old and the grout stained. The toilet flush, I'm sure, could be heard two rooms down on either side- it was seriously THAT loud. Plus, it was so small you couldn't close the door until you were actually sitting on the toilet. The counter space (or lack there-of) did not have sufficient space for my make-up bag, and it's hardly a suitcase. The walls were thin and we could easily hear conversations next door, along with our neighbors own plumbing issues. The radiator was not working which sucked because the building was freezing cold. One last thing: this hotel is definitely not handicapped friendly. There are stairs leading from the front desk to the elevator. I'm not handicapped, but it was hard dragging my luggage up a flight of stairs. Because my husband and I were so disappointed, we left a day early and drove back home to Vancouver, BC.

We love the old, deep porcelain bathtub with endless hot water. This alone makes me love my room. The one-piece modern sink is stunning and now, I know, I must have one of my own. We walked here from the ferry on Thanksgiving. FYI: If I'd known, I'd choose to go straight up the hill to third or fourth avenue and walk downtown to the hotel that way. I had my young daughter with me and we ended up walking a gauntlet of single, homeless or illegal, men sitting on the pier near the marketplace. It was uncomfortable for both of us, especially pulling our luggage along. It wasn't the highest vibration for sure. In addition, we ate a great Thanksgiving buffet dinner across the street at the Sazerac Restaurant located in the Hotel Monaco. Delicious! It was a lovely way to spend the holiday, for certain.

Unfortunately, by the time I booked a hotel room all the major hotels near the convention center had no vacancies. The Executive Pacific was the only thing in the vicinity. It was a just a brisk 10-minute walk to the convention center, which I rather enjoyed. Also, on the positive side, there's a good coffee shop (Seattle's Best) right in the hotel. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. The bed was very comfortable. Front desk service was prompt and polite. On the downside, the room was extremely small, not that this fact mattered in my case. The website boasts a 'cardio room,' which is nothing more than three machines (an almost kaput treadmill, bike, and cross-trainer).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10962364">The hotel is in a great location that was within walking distance to everything! Great shopping, pike market, good restaurants, and the waterfront. Also the area was very safe! We walked around at night with no worries!The hotel is also in the free transit zone, so you can take a bus around downtown for free! We got the queen superior room, and although it wasn't huge it comfortably fit two people and two large suitcases. The rooms were clean and the beds were VERY comfy! The only complaints are that the walls were thin and the elevator was loud. We could hear the people in the room next to us in the morning, but that was manageable. Our room was right across the hall from the elevator, but once we fell asleep you didn't hear it, and the hotel didn't attract a crowd of young partiers who came in really late at night. The staff at check-in (9:00pm) at the front desk, weren't that pleasant, and kind of rude, but the rest of the staff for the remainder of our trip was very cheerful and helpful. A big plus of the hotel is that they held our luggage for the day after we checked out, until we left for the airport, for free! Seattle's Best Coffee in the hotel was great! It made the whole hotel smell wonderful in the morning, and was a great way to get the morning started! The restaurant in the hotel was very good. The sushi was amazing! other great restaurants were steamers which is right on the waterfront, and shuckers which is in the Fairmont Olympic next door. Both of these restaurants had 2-for-1 coupons in the entertainment book, which was an added bonus on top of the amazing food! Although the hotel isn't a stop on any of the airport shuttles, Grayline Shuttle stops at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel, which is not even half a block away! you can pay an extra $5 to get dropped off at the door of the hotel, but you can easily walk from the Fairmont. Also Grayline was alot cheaper than a taxi, and came every 15 minutes which was very convient! All in all the hotel was excellent for the amount that we paid! We were on a tight budget, but wanted to stay somewhere that was clean and comfy and in a safe area, and the Executive Pacific provided everything that we could have wanted! We would definately stay here again, and recommend it to everyone!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10796160">This was an overall great experience. I became discouraged when reading the other reviews, but I believe some were a bit unfair. If you are going to this hotel expecting it to be a 5-star resort, you will be disappointed. I went with my boyfriend from the 10th-12th, and I had an AMAZING stay. Check in was fast, no room mix ups, and it has a very convenient parking garage right next door for only 19$ a night, and you can come and go as you please. We stayed in 402, and it had a terrible view of the backside of the parking garage and the hotel generator, but we didn't get a room for the view. (Hopefully if you are going to Seattle you're not planning on staying in the whole time! That's not what this hotel is for!) WHITE GOOSE-DOWN COMFORTERS. Very clean room, comfortable bed. Flat screen panel TV of good size. We had to call the maintenence man to fix the toilet, but other than that no complications. The hotel is charming, a cute little coffee hosue down stairs, but very thin walls. You can hear a lot, so try to get a room away from the elevators, and we brough a portable DVD player and some movies for at night to help drown out the noise. PERFECT location. 6 blocks away from the mall where you can catch the monorail for 2 bucks and get to the City center/space needle/EMP museum in NO time at all. Only a short, downhill hike to Pike's and the waterfront. For it's location, price, and comfort, it is a steal. I would recommend this hotel if you are easy going and not expecting a 5 star spa. It was perfect for the weekend getaway.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10136524">This hotel is a bit run down, but it's clean and very conveniently located. Free WiFi Internet! Relatively inexpensive. Unusually efficient desk made check-in and check-out a breeze. Two problems: 1. The two elevators are slow so wait times can be significant. 2. Official check-in time is 4:00 PM, so that a room was not available for a check-in at noon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10023418">Fantastic location for those who want to be close to Pike Place and the waterfront. Staff was very helpful and knoweldgeable about the area. Would stay again there again. Room was on the small side but clean.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8838962">Hotel was well located. Rooms quite cozy and a comfy bed. Bathroom was fine, but as others have said...the toilet flush is really noisy and likely to wake up 'the other half' in the middle of the night. We did find that the door to the adjcent room was really thin, so got disturbed one night by next door's antics, but a quick phone call to reception at 3am and it was soon sorted. The only real grip I had was the attitude of the reception desk manager (whose name I forget) but had the charm of a brick. He was neither welcoming or terribly polite and, having just arrived in Seattle from Vancouver, I was shocked and disappointed at the welcome to the city. My tip to the hotel management would be to send this guy on a charm course...or maybe just get somebody else in. Other than that, an OK hotel in a convenient part of town. Cheers!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8501740">Firstly, I want to express that this hotel was horrible. Our room was match box tiny, you couldn't even breathe, though that was expected because we only paid $120 per night for the room. We were charged an extra $50 dollar parking fee for two nights. It was actually supposed to be $40 but they seemed to tack on an extra $10 for a "deposit" (Phone and Television were not included, but were probably an extra $50) The room was only worth 100 dollars. We had an "executive" view of the dirty brick building across from us and we had holes in the walls. Nice huh? Oh yeah and we were basically threatened at the desk. We were told "If there is ANY noise or disturbance we will evict you." We were also discriminated against because we were "under 21" I feel personally offended that they discriminated agenst us. We are paying customers. A word to the wise, if you are looking for a nice place to stay with nice people, DON'T GO HERE!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8370862">We had a 2-night stay in mid-July 2007 and found the hotel convenient (right across the street from the public library - a Rem Koolhass gem!). In the "free ride" zone, this hotel was just fine. We are 2 NJ teachers who prefer to spend our money on what we see and eat than where we sleep, but we do demand a clean and comfortable hotel. This fit the bill. We liked the free internet on the 2 house computers. Lots of nice restaurants in the immediate area. Convenient to Pioneer Square and within walking distance of (or free bus ride to) the main shopping district and the Monorail to the Space Needle. Nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8267119">I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. The room was clean, small but comfortable, everything worked well, and the staff was all very pleasant. There is a cardio room with an eliptical, bike, and treadmill, that I think is new. I used it and it is small and worked well for my needs. I looked out to the new Seattle Library, which was fantastic. I walked everywhere, but remember that the downtown area is in the "free zone' of the Metro, so you can hop on a bus and to to another part of the free zone. And, I had 2 beautifully sunny days in Seattle! A fantastic place!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8252546">My husband and I just stayed at the hotel in mid-July and had a horrible experience there. Not only was our Superior Queen room incredibly cramped, but the noises from the elevator and other guests' rooms made it nearly impossible to sleep through the night. Also, the hotel promises other amenities such as wireless internet access from the rooms, but it wasn't working while we were there. We felt like we paid too much for this place and it set a sour tone for the beginning of our vacation. After two nights, we cancelled the rest of our stay there and booked at a new hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8066483">The hotel was clean and central to shopping, restaurants,etc. there was a restaurant on the main floor but unfortunately it was reserved that night for a wedding. Just across the street was a great restaurant that served these little shrimp fritters called beignets and really good corn bread, so moist. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but one thing that wasn't good about it was that we had to park our car in the covered parking area and walk in the alley to get back to the hotel lobby. It seemed inconvenient, they did have valet parking but it cost $25.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8038898">We stayed in this hotel for two nights and then returned for one more night before leaving Seattle. We had a king size room and it was actually a very large room, but the bathrooms were very small both times. The sink was so tiny the second time with no room to put any toiletries anywhere. Overall the room was clean and had a nice bed and flat-screen TV. There is also some road noise from the street. The parking was $19 a night with in and out privileges. Good location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7845267">My boyfriend and I stayed here last November, just before Thanksgiving. Not the best time to visit, of course, but i used to live there and wanted to show him what it was like (rain, dark, wind) for me the years I was there. As someone who DID live in seattle, i thought this was the perfect location in between downtown and the financial district, to get a perfect taste of the downtown area. From there, we could walk to Pike Place Market or in the other direction to Pioneer Square. Our room faced the gorgeous architecture of the library. Our room was extemely cozy, but we got a good deal on a package so it was worth every penny. If i'd paid a lot for the room, i would be less pleased. Our room had a door (locked of course) connecting it to another room. The people in the other room were quite loud. And we're not fussy people that need silence or anything. But through the door we could hear them talking and what seemed like a dozen babies of different ages crying and babbling. Not very romantic. BUT! We loved the bed! It was so comfortable, we were inspired to take many naps and someday have a bed just like it in our own house. The linens were amazing, as were the pillows. I would definitely go back to this hotel, and plan to, in a more sunny time of year. Nice that there was a Seattle's Best Coffee shop connected to the lobby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7808071">The rooms in this hotel are small, but clean. The staff was courteous, but not helpful. I have three complaints. My room was very noisy. I could hear the pipes rattling all night when people ran water or flushed the toilet. And I could hear the people in the next room dragging their hangers across the clothes rods in the closet. These noises made it really hard to sleep and I am not a light sleeper. I think a light sleeper wouldn't get a wink of sleep in this hotel. Although the front desk staff was very nice when I asked her to send a fax, she didn't actually send it. I didn't learn that she never sent the fax until I returned home--three days after I thought my fax had been sent. I asked the front desk to send up a bottle of hair conditioner. The person sent up a PARTIALLY USED bottle of the same conditioning shampoo I already had. That grossed me out.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7696311">I stayed 2 nights at the Executive while in Seattle on business. The rooms are small but that was to be expected as it is a boutique hotel. I was not prepared for the size of the bathroom, however. I literally had to step into the stall shower to close the door. My room was obviously part of a suite at one time as there was a door to the adjoining room (blocked by a large TV) through which I could hear every word of the conversations my neighbors were having. The hotel offers free wireless which is nice but no desk on which to work. The bed was amazing, however. Very comfortable. Nice pillows. Great down comforter. And the air conditioning worked quite well too. Seattle's Best coffee house in the lobby was a great bonus. Plus you can't beat the location for the price. If these were my only complaints, I would stay here again. After all, you do sacrifice some amenities for price and charm. However, these are minor compared to the quality of the service I received at this hotel. I should have been prepared for poor service since, when I called to confirm a late arrival, they answered the phone with a plain "hello" instead of announcing the hotel. I arrived at 11:00 pm and neither one of the 2 young men behind the counter moved to hold the door or help me with my bags. The lobby is a few steps up from the elevator and, after checking in, neither of them moved to help me get my bags down the stairs either. They literally stood behind the desk and watched me struggle with them. The housekeeping staff was not much better. The room looked like it had been just neatened, not cleaned. The in room coffee pot was not washed out. The carpet was not vacuumed. Hopefully the owner of this hotel will read this review and shape up his staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6822839">My sister and I spent two days in Seattle and stayed at the Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel. We chose this hotel because it was affordable and in a prime location. For travelers who are only going to be using thier hotel room to sleep and shower, this is a great choice. It is not a luxury hotel, but a practical choice for active tavelers. Here's what we thought of the hotel: PROS: -Location, location, location. The hotel is across the street from the stunning Seattle Library, and within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. -Affordable. Of all the downtown hotels we looked at this was the least expensive. -Friendly staff. The front desk attendants helped us make the most of our stay by recommending restaurants and calling taxis. Also, they offer complimentary maps, and will loan you an umbrella to use for the day. -Newly renovated. The hotel is certainly old, but they have made an effort to update the look with new modern furnishings. The down comforters on the bed were wonderful! -Clean. Although there was a faint smell of old smoke in the hall, our room and bath was neat and clean. I saw no signs of mold or dirt. CONS: -It's Small. The lobby, the rooms, the bathrooms--they're all small. My sister and I were able walk around comfortably, but there's certainly no extra space. I think it would feel cramped if there were more than two guests in a room. -It's a Buget Hotel. Travelers who are used to the luxury of larger resort hotels will be dissapointed. However, as I've said before, if you're only using the hotel room to sleep and shower, it's more than adequate. -It's Old. While they have made an effort to revamp the hotel, there's no hiding the fact that the building itself is old. There was a faint smell of old smoke in the halls and the doors have obviously been painted many times. Carpet, furniture, and bathroom fixtures, however, are new. -Street noise. While street noise will be a problem in any downtown hotel, this hotel doesn't have the thicker windows that many of the newer hotels are installing. The noise wasn't enough to keep us from sleeping. Overall, a great pick if you're looking for a clean, affordable place to crash before hitting the town again. If you're looking for something luxurious or romantic, this probably isn't the place for you. Hope this helps! Enjoy Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6777999">Nothing impressive about this hotel. It's OK if you're on a budget, not looking for anything more than the basics and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room. The down comforters are a nice touch, but that's about it. The rooms are tiny tiny and the walls are very thin. And the bathrooms ... We first checked into a room where the toilet didn't flush correctly. We asked to move to another room, and in this one, the industrial-style toilet handle stuck out underneath the toilet lid, so you couldn't put the lid down. (See photo.) Bad design. The best thing the hotel's got going for itself is its central location -- a quick downhill stroll to the shops and restaurants on 1st Avenue and ferries (for a ride over to Bainbridge Island). Pike Place Market is within easy walking distance, too. Friendly tip: There are some rooms located directly across from the elevator, make sure your room isn't one of them.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6564975">The downtown location is great, especially to QWest field, for a Seahawks game.

The room's size was perfect -- chair by the window, large armoir w/TV that had 3 drawers for your stuff, queen bed and nightstand on each side. Bathroom was very small, but adequate. Everything was clean and the bed had great pillows and a wonderful down comforter -- very comfortable! We booked online and, luckily, printed out our confirmation w/room rate. Had to show this to the manager in order to get that room rate. Other than that, we had no complaints. Old hotel -- quite charming -- location is GREAT -- close to everything!

Even though there was no view from a small window in my room, the room was very clean and cozy. I think it's enough for a single traveler to stay the standard room. The location is very nice. It's close to sea and market. I recommend that you should take a walk to market, and have a breakfast there. When i visit to Seattle again, I will book this hotel. For this time I booked this hotel at pacificplazahotel.com because they offer cheaper price than expedia.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5700076">Really really really small room but old buildings like this are often small. They have two computers for guest use and Wi-Fi in a nice sitting room/business area. Parking costs about $8 per day in covered garage next door. Good location for shopping and waterfront. Loved Elliotts Waterfront restaurant and The Brooklyn Restaurant. Loved Nordstroms! Had a great time in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5627950">We recently stayed at the hotel for a two day getaway and were quite happy with the place. The room was small but clean and had updated decor. We did not have a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it was trendy &amp; the menu looked quite good. The hotel has a fantastic location, especially since we were doing the tourist thing, and walked all over the downtown area. It was 10 minutes to Pike Place market, the monorail, and to Pioneer Square (lots of street people). Since it's an old building the room was a little noisy during the night (doors slamming, pipes running, etc.) so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. The internet in the lobby was spotty and quite slow, so don't expect to do any work there. Service was very good &amp; we liked that Seattle's Best coffee shop was just off the lobby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5574255">The hotel was barely ok- the location was terrific. When you enter the lobby, you either have to go down or up a flight of stairs to get to the elevator - not handicapped friendly, for sure. Also, the room was very small, dingy, with a non-working air conditioner. It usually isn't required in Seattle, but on 2 of the days we were there, we sure could have used it. The bathroom was small, could not accomodate my toiletries. The toilet lid did not stay up by itself - so it was quite an inconvenience for my traveling companion (male) and had to be held up with one hand. It wasn't something that could easily be fixed, because there was a ledge built in over it that was obviously not measured correctly. When the window was open, the bathroom door did not stay closed (painted over too many times), so we had to wedge a washcloth in the door. The bedspread was very old and cheap-looking, like something out of a cheap motel. The carpets were in bad shape, too. My pillow was lumpy - and only one per person. I had to ask for more - got them the next day, after a second request. The help was nice, as were the housekeepers. The location made it tolerable, but without some serious interior renovations, I would not choose this hotel again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5456648">This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, in my life! It was disgusting, dark and dirty. The rooms are like closets. The carpet was awful. There were stains on the comforter. There was an electric radiator in the room. I couldn't wait until sunrise to check out of there. I wouldn't recommend anyone staying here if your looking for R&amp;R.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5429811">We booked this hotel and were confused when we arrived as it did not seem to be as the website indicated. The name is so similar to the Pacific Plaza and Tripadvisor do not differentiate as the confusing travellers reports indicate. The Executive Pacific Hotel is meant to be a boutique hotel. It is overpriced and shabby. The rooms are tiny and the room service dreadful. There is no bar or dining facilities. There is a coffee shop at ground floor and a japanese restaurant next door. I complained my phone was not working on arrival and 4 days later they fixed it and no apology. I had messages waiting from my arrival date and they had done nothing. . The public space is split level and simple. The experience was unexciting and all in all it was a big dissappointment. There are better places to stay and we walked passed many of them during our stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4740991">The location is good and the price is hard to beat for downtown. From the 6th floor the traffic noise is low enough not to unduly disturb your sleep. The bathrooms were very clean. The high speed internet was free. That being said: 1) The pillows on the bed were stinky, as if many sweaty heads had lain on them. 2) The heads were probably sweaty because the thermostat was broken and all you could get was OFF or REALLY HOT. Fortunately the weather was mild enough that "OFF" was an acceptable option since no one was willing to do anything about it. Which makes sense since the entire 6th floor seemed to be thusly afflicted (a sampling of 3 rooms). Finally, I'm curious as to how disabled people might access the rooms as I don't think you can get to an elevator w/o dealing with stairs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4476692">Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel, Downtown Seattle. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody as the basic hygene conditions were also not met. On checking in and visiting the washroom, the toilet had urine in it. The towel had shaved hair on it. The bath tub did not drain and I was forced to be partially submerged in dirty water while taking a shower. Try and find another place, any other place but not this.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4104391">We had 2 nights in this hotel in September before taking an Alaskan cruise and the experience couldn't have been better. An older, moderately-priced hotel, but a better standard of accommodation than we were expecting for the price. The room was spacious, with a king bed, and very comfortable. No view, but we didn't pick the hotel for that. A friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Not as formal as other hotels we stayed in on our holiday, but perfect for this hotel. And absolute top marks to the Concierge, Zach. A welcoming and helpful presence at the front of the hotel. Always ready to ask what our plans were as we headed out sightseeing (and to make suggestions of things to see) and to ask how the day had been as we returned, tired and footsore. But he went further than that. We flew from New Zealand to San Francisco, then on to Seattle, and United managed to leave one bag behind in San Fran. We sorted it out at the airport and were assured it would be sent on the next available flight and delivered to the hotel. That was at 2pm. By about 8pm my wife realised that her insulin was in the missing bag. I went down to reception to ask if there was a way of ringing United at the airline's expense. The receptionist was rather vague, but Zach came over to ask what was wrong, then took over. By then United's normal offices were closed and weren't answering their phone at the airport either. But Zach somehow tracked down a United supervisor and stressed the urgency of the matter. He followed this up twice more before his shift ended at 10pm. The bag was finally delivered to our room at 2am, but Zach's efforts went way beyond what we expected. Since returning home we have contacted the hotel manager and expressed our great appreciation of Zach's assistance. Back to the hotel. A handy location - easy walking to downtown, waterfront, Pioneer Square. The return trip, up some of those steep streets can be tiring though. And having a Seattle's Best attached to the hotel is wonderful as well - those hot caramel apple ciders!!! Who needs Starbucks? Seattle's a lovely city and we want to return to spend longer. And our first stop will be this hotel. We would only look elsewhere if they happened to be fully booked.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4089727">Approximately three weeks ago, my husband, our dog and myself were repeat guests at the Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel for a quick business trip. Just the month prior we had stayed there for 5-days along with my father for my son's graduation and had a great time. The majority of the staff was quite friendly and inviting. The price was very affordable, the rooms were nice and the location was amazing for our needs. The only challenge I encountered was when I reserved the room and asked the very nice reservationists that confirmation be directed via e-mail so I could forward my fathers for his itinerary as he was traveling up from California. I was assured this would occur, it did not. For the most part the experience was great; so I had been talking up this property with is affordability and location. When I needed to return for business, I again selected this property due to the positive experience three weeks prior. Although, this time I booked my reservation on-line through a third party so that I would immediately receive a confirmation as well as itinerary for my travels and that is exactly what occurred. I called the property in advance to confirm arrangements and informed them that we would be bringing our dog again. They confirm acknowledgement. Upon arriving at the property, I mentioned that we were returning after just three weeks of our previous visit, of which was acknowledged. We were assigned our room, which when we entered we were not quite so impressed. The room was located in a wing of the hotel, where at the end of the hallway there were four rooms clustered and there were hand written signs on the room doors around ours stating that they were painting. It was located on the same floor as our previous room, although rather than a king bed there was a queen. The room was very small and cramped with a view of all of the back of the house workings and systems, although we would not be staying long so this was not a big issue. From the time we checked in until I needed to leave for my event at 5:00pm, there was the sound of possibly a paint sprayer, which did not cause too much discomfort. We returned back at the hotel at approximately 11:30pm, very tired from a total of 4-days of travel and early to late events. We slept just fine until promptly at 7:47am we were awaken by the sounds of staff yelling back and forth to each other. This stopped for about 50 minutes until it again began. We decided it was time to pack up and leave anyway, so no big deal (I guess?). My husband took the dog out for a walk and then to put her in the car while I continued to prepare for our departure. He came back to tell me that when he went back to our car, he found that it had been broken into. He contacted the garage attendant and was told that it was a 17 level garage and this happens all the time. This is the only offered parking by the hotel. At this point, weighing out the entire experience in such a limited stay, I was now feeling quite disappointed and decided to share my experience with management. So upon check out I asked the very nice front desk attendant if I could speak with a manager in regards to my experience and she stated that she was the Front Desk Supervisor and did I wish to speak with the General Manager. I told her I was comfortable speaking with her if she was comfortable with that and she then could share with her GM. She said yes. I went on to explain my entire experience, of which she empathized and then I added that it appeared apparent to me that I was penalized by booking through a third party with the room assignment and even when the opportunity was raised to upgrade me, no one chose to and I was quite confident their hotel was not at 100% occupancy. I also stated that they new there would be construction noise and that they could have given me the option of whether I would or would not be bothered by it in advance. She did not argue these facts. She offered to credit the parking charge and said that she would have credited my room night charge, but that I had already paid????? That was just insult to injury at that point. I do have to say that after all was said and done we were treated better by the parking garage management, who graciously offered to vacuum out all of the glass in our car from the window the thief broke at no charge, so that we could let our dog in I have been in the hotel management business for the past 10-years and believe I have an understanding point of view, although all and all, I have never have my patronage so unappreciated. The hotel has so much potential and I understand that it just recently changed ownership/management in July. But they need to remember that they just need to make people feel special and that goes a long way to the guest experience, regardless of the things that are out of their direct control. It has now been three weeks and I have not had any follow-up from the hotel. All and all, my experience was disappointing!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4051020">If you are traveling on a budget and want the best location and the nicest room possible for around a $100, this is the place. It is an older, but well maintained hotel, that is within walking distance of Pike's Place Market (about 1/2 mile one way). It is located across the street from the new Seattle Central Library. You can park your car and not use it again until you are ready to check out. An advantage in a city that has serious traffic and parking problems. The competition in this price range is mostly cheap hotel chains such as Comfort Inn that are mostly located on freeway onramps, where you need to drive to everything.

Boutique style hotel with great staff and has a coffee shop on site (Seattles Best I think??). I have sent many friends from Victoria to stay here and they have all loved it. This hotel is my first choice for business or pleasure travel to Seattle as they always offer such a great deal! Keep up the good work!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3810636">Relatively cheap by downtown standards, the PP offers little more than a place to sleep -- and without AC, not sleep well when daytime temps soar. There are fans in the rooms, but they can do nothing about the humidity. Numerous air purifyers operating throughout the hallways don't quite get the musty smell out. I've seen bigger bathrooms on cruise ships, but at least you need not worry about falling down -- there's no room to do it. While I'm sure the bellhop would help with bags, the elevator doesn't stop at ground level -- you either carry your luggage down about 20 steps or up 10 steps. (I don't think wheel chairs could be accom- modated -- check with hotel,) You decide if it's worth $100/night more for amenites lacking in this older but adequate facility. Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on site with good coffee and bakery items. Walk to many downtown sites and restaurants or ride the 'free zone' busses in the downtown area. I initially was going to give this 2 stars, but in reviewing the plusses -- location, price and friendly staff -- I elevated my rating.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3735843">We were in Seattle just one night and opted for location and price over lack of air conditioning -- but our room was quite uncomfortably warm, even with the large screened window and both a ceiling and bureau fan going full speed. Location is prime -- we walked right across the street and had a wonderful tour of the Seattle Library, then walked down the street to the Pike Market and up the street to the Frye Museum. Staff very pleasant. Room was also pretty small for the three of us (adult couple and teenage daughter).

Yes, late but still, I'm sure things don't change that much. We were apprehensive about the hotel before arrival from reading about it and the fact that it is a very old hotel in the downtown area. I was nervous that it would be in skid-row. Heehee. It wasn't. It was great that way. What sold us was that it is a completely NON-SMOKING hotel! YES! That did it. When we arrived, the room was small and seemed old but it was very clean. It could use more light. The washroom is very tiny like everyone says. Still, the location is GREAT and the room was very quiet. We faced the library, away from the main street. We enjoyed the easy access to everything so much that we left the car parked in the parking lot for 4 days. Yes, it did cost $18 a day to park. Ouch. The lobby/mezzanine area was actually bright, large and inviting. It was more contemporary and newer with sofa/reading area and free internet computers. Still, we loved our little cubby-hole and would definitely stay there again! It isn't a 4-star hotel but we were open minded enough to enjoy the old world charm. It's CLEAN and feels very safe. Those are the things that are important and oh... the price was good too. About $70ish a night. -Mae<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3549608">Only real concern was lack of a/c in rooms. Temp was in the 60's the week I was there, so that was not a problem. Each room has a ceiling fan and a small oscillating fan. Two colleagues and myself were in Seattle for business meetings at the "W", but we stayed at the Plaza. It is literally 'next door" to the "W", at 1/3 the price. Rooms are small, older, but very clean. Beds were great. My wife came to town the day the conference ended and we stayed 3 more nights at the Plaza. If my experience for the first three nights had been unsatisfactory, we wouldn't have stayed the rest of the week. If you just want a place to sleep and shower, it can't be beat.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3539644">We booked our room after reading a review that said this hotel was "European" style. Having spent considerable time in Europe, we were very disappointed in the size of the room--very small; the esthetics--dreary, old, depressing, and noisy; and the price, which we felt was really ridiculous for this room. We had just come from Little America in Salt Lake City, which could account for our disappointment. The only positives I can find are the location--great--and the desk staff--very helpful. It seems that the hotel's location gives them the "right" to offer a very substandard experience. After reading the reviews since we stayed there, it doesn't sound like any changes for the better have been made.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3420071">I spent four nights at the Pacific Plaza, and while I was not overly impressed with my hotel room, it was perfectly adequate for what I needed. I found the bed to be quite comfortable, even if the three pillows were small and a bit squished. The room contained a queen-sized bed, a large upholstered chair, a medium dresser and a large television set. The bathroom was small but very clean, and fresh towels and soap were provided every day. I was very happy with this hotel for the price that I paid. I enjoyed the coffee shop on the main level, and the visitor lobby (complete with free internet acessible computers) was wonderful.

Loved Seattle!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3169733">My husband and I stayed at this hate for the weekend of 4th - 7th Feb 2005. I booked the hotel some time ago, before some of the negative comments so upon re-checking the website before I set off I was a little apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived late and were greeted by a rather unfriendly bellboy, not the end of the world but certainly a long way of a warm welcome. Our room was fine, weâ€™d been upgraded to a king and it was fairly comfortable. In the morning however I noticed that the bathroom hadnâ€™t really been cleaned all that well. I would stay the standard of cleanliness was debatable, not too bad though if youâ€™re not fussy. Having been out and about all day my husband and I returned ot the room around 4pm, and it was a cold inside as it was outside. I check with reception nd they said that they have to turn the heating off during the day to prevent the system from overheating! What! Heating came back on at 8pm. Another point to note was that the walls are very very thin. Our neighbours were watching Bridgett Jones; we managed to hear every word, given that Iâ€™d seen the film before I wasnâ€™t so excited about hearing it again at 11pm. On a positive the location was great. The hotel cost $89 a night (booked directly â€“ no breakfast) although I did notice Expedia had rooms going for $79 a night. We didnâ€™tâ€™ spend an awful lot of time in the hotel, I do think you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3027832">Ok, so this hotel is inexpensive for Seattle city centre, but we think that cleanliness should be included in the price! We switched rooms as the bathroom was definitely cruddy and the bed sheets looked and smelled like they had been slept in and just smoothed over. The front desk gave us another room with no qualms. Rooms are a bit pokey and ours had a view of the parking lot opposite, but for one night before our flight the next day, it sufficed. The hotel is well-located for seeing the sights if you don't mind walking, you can get the monorail to the Space Needle just down the street too. The airport shuttle drop-off is a convenient block away. Last word, the breakfast is fine if you're on the go, coffee and danish from Seattle's Best Coffee downstairs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2908397">Stayed for a night 18 december 04 and didn't quite live up to my expectations, but still a decent value overall. Very convenient location downtown, close to shopping. Staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. There was a cozy coffee shop across adjacent to the front desk. The hotel was VERY clean considering it was an 80-year-old building, but the rooms were quite small and ambient noise from the other rooms was quite apparent. beds were clean and comfortable, but the pipes in the building made heaps of noise in the middle of the night. Probably not the best choice if you're a light sleeper, but still a good value right downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2820602">Who are you people who love this hotel? My trip to Seattle was perfect, except for having to stay at this perfectly horrid place. We had a corner "suite" which was actually a tiny room with hardly enough room to get around the incredibly hard and lumpy bed. The bathroom was so small that we had to take turns at the sink, as two people will not fit in there at the same time unless one person stands in the tub! It was cold the night we stayed, and the heat didn't work. Housekeeping walked into the room at 8 a.m without waiting for us to answer the door, just knocked once and came right in! As for location, it was probably once a charming hotel. It sits up on the hill right across the street from the public library. It's a good 8 or more blocks down to the waterfront, which isn't so bad going down, but it's quite a trek to walk back up--this is not a small hill, it's very steep, so look forward to getting in some cardio during your stay. And pack comfortable shoes, it's at least two miles to the space needle. Don't get roped into the "suite with deluxe breakfast" deal, either. The deluxe breakfast consists of a small drip coffee and a muffin at the coffee shop downstairs. All in all, including taxes, we paid almost $200 a night for a cup of coffee and a room that rates no better than a Motel 6. For the price, I've had much, much better accomodations. My best suggestion after seeing the area, stay at the Marriott on the waterfront. It's only a few dollars more, just steps from the Pike St. Market, and sits on the water. The rooms are gorgeous (and HUGE!) and it's central to everything. We also had dinner at a place called The Brooklyn. Highly recommend. Stellar service, and amazing food. I truly enjoyed my trip to Seattle, but next time we'll do one thing very differently. STAY AT A BETTER HOTEL!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2592770">After reading some of these reviews I was quite surprised by how wonderful this hotel really is. It was very clean and neat-- nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room that we had was what I would consider to be an above average size for a big city hotel. I did not find it too hot or too cold. The bathroom may be a problem for some people who are larger because the toliet sits right next to the bathtub. I also enjoyed having Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on the ground floor for breakfast pastries and coffee every morning. The hotel is within a close walk to Pioneer Square, the Piers, Pike Place Market, and Nordstrom, etc. We even walked back from the Space Needle at night and it was not really that bad-- but definitely pack your best walking shoes.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR968033750">nice, but don't wait for the shuttle After coming in from Florida and calling 3 times for a shuttle pick-up, it arrived 45 minutes later. It would have been much easier just to drag the luggage down across the street to the hotel in about 5 minutes. Room on the 7th floor was smokey, night manager very helpful and changed our room immediately to a nonsmoking floor.

The Radisson is a short walk from the baggage claim: just walk to the first light and cross the street! The sleep number beds were a nice option here.

This hotel is about as close as you can possibly get to a major airport -- literally a 10-minute walk to the airport.

Would recommend only for an overnight stay for an early morning flight.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR264908660">Pretty good overall I was pretty happy with the room, and it was a full service hotel so we had help with our luggage and room service and needed to call the front desk for a favor a few times and they were happy to oblige. The room size was fine for two adults (standard king). We liked the sleep number bed, but we don't exactly think they're all that wonderful. We never heard plane noise because we weren't facing the front of the hotel. The manager told us this, because we asked for a quiet room and they said then choose something that doesn't face the airport! So we picked the top floor (so we wouldn't have neighbors above us) that faced away. I never heard a single plane and I kept the window open all night long. Which brings me to my complaint. Perhaps it was the time of the year (Febuary) but they said the a/c won't cool to a temperature any lower than what it is outside. (Which really wasn't even true because I couldn't get it lower than 75-78 and outside it was 50). This is after they brought an engineer up to look at it and then had us move two doors down thinking our a/c was broken. So they told us that that was just the way the a/c worked but maybe it would be better by the next time we come back. I told them I had been uncomfortable sleeping for days and at check-out they refunded for about 2-3 nights worth of our stay. The manager was very friendly and tried to help as much as possible. So even though I think Radisson's climate control system is nuts, it isn't the manager's fault and they did do everything they could to try to correct it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR134972758">Nice place to stay My wife and I choose to stay here after a flight from the east coast. We flew in a day early for our Alaskan cruise. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel but it would be MUCH easier just to exit the airport, turn right and start walking toward the other hotels you can see in the area. You will quickly see the Radisson. It is easily within walking distance from the airport. Our room rate for a single king was $109. I made my reservations online thru Expedia. Our check-in was quick and easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and clean. The Sleep Number bed was comfortable. We used the Towne Car service for the 25 minute ride to the Space Needle ($40). A very nice service in a Lincoln Towne Car. The price of a taxi is roughly $38 without tip. We were very pleased with the Radisson and would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR899270015">No 3* Hotel Got this hotel through Priceline for $43 a night. We have stayed at the SeaTac Hilton and Doubletree Hotels for the same price in the past and was hoping for the same. No such luck unfortunately.Pros: free parking for guests. One free bottle of water. Newspaper in the morning.Cons: sleep number bed way over-rated. Give me a Heavenly Bed or Hilton bed any night! It was nothing special. The bed linens were plain and did not feel clean. Definitely not luxurious. The bathtub was old and grimy. No rubberized bath mat so the floor of the tub was slippery. Ice machine on the floor did not work. Guest checkout and hotel evaluation on TV did not work. Room moderately quiet- airplane noise not a problem after 11 PM.Bottom line- this is no 3* hotel (2* at best) and I hope we never have to stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR887193841">Was a horrible experience! Our family of four booked this hotel on hotwire so we had no idea what we were getting before we agreed. When I saw it was the Radisson I was sort of thinking I got a great deal for $60. Was I ever wrong. There were water stains on the ceiling, musty smell in the room. The glasses were dirty with lipstick marks on them and it wasnt too modern. I thought to myself Well for $60 what do you expect? What I didnt expect was for my 12 year old to sit on the bed and say what's wrong wtih the bed mom Me going over there to discover the bed was broken. The frame was all twisted up and it was rigged to somewhat try to work. We called management who came up and took a look, apologize and give us another room. The next room, same thing. I went to sit on the edge of the bed and the whole bed collapsed!! It too was broken. We called management who came up and said he was sorry again and moved us one more time! This next place was much nicer. They had sleep number beds in them and it seemed more updated then the other horrible rooms we were in. I made a guess that they saved these horrible rooms for hotwire customers and the people paying full price got the nice beds and nice rooms. I called up hotwire who did an investigation and refunded my money!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR281804322">Walking distance to the airport Me and my wife spent one night at Sea-Tac Radisson at the beginning of June 2005. There was a shuttle to the airport, but it take as much time to get there by foot, just exit the airport and go right. After couple minutes you will see the hotel. We had a front side room. From time to time you could hear planes at the tarmac, but it was more quiet after 10 PM. Room was clean and nice. Free internet connection, breakfast was not free. I will recommend this hotel as a good one. AAA rate was acceptable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR380660363">Not your typical Radisson, not luxury by any means I recently returned from a weeklong trip through CA/OR/WA and stayed at the Radisson at SEA-TAC (there are two Radisson hotels within a 3 block radius, so confusion is likely) the night before an early flight. The hotel, while very close to the airport, is not your typical Radisson. I had never before stayed in a Radisson but according to reviews from family members and friends who had, I was expecting a luxury hotel. It appears from the temporary-looking signage and the fact that there is another Radisson three blocks down the street, that Radissson recently acquired this hotel from another chain, perhaps Ramada. This hotel, or perhaps more accurately, motel was nowhere near the standards of luxury. I was disappointed and also glad that I had only booked a room for one night. I would not have been happy to have had an extended stay at the Radisson. It was subpar, at best. My main gripe were the beds, which were very motel-like and certainly not equivalent to what actual luxury hotels are currently offering like Sweet Sleeper's and the Heavenly beds. I happen to subscribe to the belief that the bed is the best indicator of how to rate a hotel and this hotel deserves a measly C-, in my opinion.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR225923751">A great place to park your car We stayed at this hotel for one night before an early morning flight. Included with the one night hotel stay was 7 days of parking for our car during our trip. So, taking the parking into consideration this is a good place to stay and a fair deal. However, I highly recommend that you get there at bedtime and leave first thing in the morning. The room was noisy, had a view of the roof and was worn and dated. There were large gaps in the door out into the hallway.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR131295555">Very Happy  I chose the hotel because it is close to the airport and had a great parking package for my early morning flight.

The crew was actually finishing installing some internet lines while I was there and they said it was the last step in the million dollar investment. The place looks great and I would absolutely recommend it.The comments I see below must have come before the remodel as they do not even come close to fitting the hotel I saw and enjoyed. It is a great place to stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR982957944">A dump I think Radisson is on a major decline I stay in many of them (because the price is cheap and my company likes that) as I travel around the country on business: They are almost always run down and about half the time, service is terrible. I suspect the good deals on Priceline come along because few want to stay there.This hotel was run down, old and has a reputation with the SeaTac police force of taking in a lot of Rif Raf. The hotel is right next to the airport, so it is convenient time wise if you are taking a flight.If you are looking for a decent hotel, avoid Radisson in general.

One was for the night we flew in to Seattle and the other was for the night before we flew out early in the morning. Well, after that first night, we immediately cancelled the second night and booked the Doubletree airport hotel. The place is so rundown, I can't believe it's a Radisson! There were nasty water stains on the ceiling and the location overall was noisy. There was a party going on all night at the ballroom, which we could hear all the way across the courtyard. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if we were closer. The only saving grace about this place was the breakfast which was really good. This is the first and last time we will ever stay at a Radisson.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR776831815">Needs Soundproofing On my way back home, I took a bump and landed myself for an overnight stay at this hotel. Not bad for a Radisson and I did expect worse; however, the constant noise of airplanes landing was very annoying. This hotel needs to somehow figure out a way to soundproof the rooms because from the looks of it, it rests right underneath one of the landing patterns.

Since I had such a wonderful time at the Radisson Los Angeles Westside, I was delighted to try the Radisson at Sea-Tac. Well, I was amazed at the difference. The carpeting was filthy. After a shower, (which wasn't very clean), I tried to use my phone and it wouldn't work. I called the front desk to find that since I hadn't left a credit-card imprint, they wouldn't turn my phone on. I explained that I was only making a calling card call anyway, and was told to bring my credit card to the front desk or forget it. I explained I had just gotten out of the shower, it was almost 1:00am, and I'd gladly read my credit card number to him and let them run it in the morning. He basically said that it wasn't his problem, and if I really wanted to use my phone that badly, I'd bring my card up front! Then, out of desparation, I asked if he would call a number for me and just have them call me back, and he said NO! A while later I called someone else at the front desk and requested a wake up call. Well, luckily for me, I set the alarm, because they never called me. Not only that, but 2 out of 4 glasses in my room were disgustingly filthy. I took them to the front desk the next morning and the lady was appauled at their condition. When I told her of my entire experience, she was nice and offered to pay for my room. That would have been great, but it was courtesy of Alaska Airlines anyway. But, at least she tried to make me feel better. Had I not just had such a great stay at the Radisson in Culver City, I would NEVER set foot in another Radisson Hotel. T.

Ask for rooms on the side of International Blvd. Since the rooms are closer to the airport, sometime you can hear plane taxiing at the gate.As a guest at the hotel, if you are planning on parking your car at the hotel premises, you would have to pay for parking, which was $9 a day.

The front desk staff was very friendly and I had a corner king room with a great view of the space needle and the waterfront (although obstructed by other buildings). The location is within a short walk of Pike Place Market and all of the downtown shopping. There are also many restaurants nearby. There was a mini fridge in the room with two bottles of complimentary water that was restocked daily and Aveda amenities. My one complaint is that the elevator took a long time, every time. There appeared to be a large convention in-house, so that was probably the cause of the slowness, but it was still frustrating.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126757262">We stayed here March 22-25 for a conference. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel abuts the highway on one side and sits on top of a hill. Everywhere you walk (other than across the highway to First Hill) is downhill....until you need to walk back up, of course. It wasn't a problem for us, but might be for others. Our room on the 22nd floor was quiet. The elevators were a bit slow at rush hours. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and well designed. There was a plug, a mirror and a light everywhere you needed one, plenty of room to unpack and even a mini fridge with complimentary bottled water. The bathroom, while not particularly large or luxurious, was spotless, and more than met our needs, with plenty of counter space, towels, Aveda products and perhaps most importantly, water pressure. Our only complaint about the room was that the thermostat had a motion-detector which did not detect our presence at night when we were asleep. It wasn't a huge problem in March (so we did not call maintenance), but might be in August. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and competent. If I could give a 4 1/2 star rating here, I would. We especially received great service from Fred, the concierge who helped with dinner reservations for a group of 8-12 two nights in a row. Both dinners, at nearby Sip and Tulio's, were great. Our meals in the hotel's own Maxwells and the Lobby Lounge were good too.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126712359">My wife bid for a two night stay (10-12 March 2012) at Priceline.com as a surprise for my birthday and this is the hotel we were booked into. No problem with the reservation - everything was as advertised. Arrived around dinnertime on Saturday 10-March - check-in went fine...UNTIL we found out how much they intended on charging for parking - $30/day plus $6 car charge + other taxes. Shocking, and took an ok deal into the "meh" category and I have big problems paying $40 to park my car. Chris and Christina were manning the front desk that evening, and couldn't have been more understanding and nice about it. Christina upgraded us to a "Corner King" as a gesture for my b-day, and dealt with our parking sticker shock as well in a very natural, kind, customer-oriented manner that turned a potential disaster into a better-than-average experience in less than 10 mins. My wife and I can not say enough about the customer-service attitude about the staff at this hotel - simply phenomenal and Chris/Christina deserve special mention for going "over and above". The hotel is a VERY tall building located right on the I-5 - we were facing the freeway on the 11th floor and the roar from the highway was non-stop and very noticeable (they were booked solid that weekend and couldn't get us a higher room, on the east side). Strongly, STRONGLY suggest that you request a high room on the West side of the hotel as soon as you book - the noise from the freeway was pretty bad though continuous so except for the trucks and sirens it turned into white noise after a while. Public spaces are very nice, even luxurious - reminds me of the Four Seasons in NY in terms of style. Pool was closed and didn't use the weight room. Location (except for the freeway) is fine - it's in the "NoCharge" zone for public transit and it's a 20-25 min walk to Pike Place Market from the hotel. Steep hill going up Madison - go up Pike to 6th St and turn right and you'll have a much easier time of it if you are physically challenged. Room was ok, nothing spectacular (though spotlessly clean). Coffee maker, king-sized bed in a separate room, two wide-screen TVs, very spacious room. Decor a bit dated but again very clean and just fine for a couple of days, or even more than that. It's a good option for downtown Seattle but research parking VERY carefully before booking here or you could be very unhappy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126601996">My colleague refused to stay at this hotel because he said the noise was unbearable. I wanted the points and told the front I wanted a quiet room. They placed me right over the freeway, and by morning I wanted to shoot the front desk. I insisted they move me away from the freeway, they did and my next two nights were wonderful. Room and small but very nice and clean. Room service and the food was really terrific! The morning buffet was nice and the service was amazing with some of the friendliest servers ever. The only problem I found was at the front desk ... They are not helpful or pleasant and they will try to stick you in the worse rooms. Insist on good placement and rooms away from the highway!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126468746">Arrived in Seattle on 3/18/2012 Hotel staff was totally helpful at the late checkin and during the week Jean-Paul at the Concierge desk went out his way to be helpful with transportation and assisting with reservation at local popular reataurants.All of the Renaissance staff had a great attutide.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126424891">I agree with the previous poster. This hotel is way too overpriced if it wants to be competitive with other Seattle hotels based on what it has to offer. I thought the sleep quality was terrible-- my sister is pregnant and was in so much pain sleeping on the beds because they are so hard and uncomfortable. Also, the walls are very thin which makes the rooms susceptible to much outside noise so I highly recommend asking for a room away from the freeways. I personally would never select this hotel again and pay full-price. If I was forced to stay here because of a great Name-Your-Own-Price deal on Priceline, I would be okay with it, but that would be because I wasn't paying full price. Either the prices overall here need to come down, or management needs to invest in some sound barriers, comfier beds and more luxurious rooms in order to draw people from competing hotels in the area. I was very disappointed that this is where I had to stay for my two-night jaunt up to Seattle. (Also- valet fees are so ridiculous. I don't care if people say that this is market price in Seattle-- no one should have to pay $40 to park their car overnight. No one. If you want people to willingly stay here, offer free parking.)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126422942">I probably would have given this hotel a 4 out of 5 - but the amazing customer service I experienced put this place over the edge. Everyone, the bellman, front desk, servers, room service etc. went out of their way to make sure I was happy and taken care of. The roof top bar is not to be missed. There was a local musician doing a show in the lounge on Friday night - nice touch. This is an older hotel, but they have really made an effort to update the guest rooms with nice dark wood and granite. However, the windows are old and a bit drafty. My room on the 25th floor had a fantasic view of the harbor and other nearby builings. There isn't a lot in the immediate few blocks, but I was easily able to walk to the Seattle Art Museum, Pioneer Park, the Waterfront and other tourist sites.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126255907">This was a beautiful hotel.

I would stay here again, though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126124403">Probably the worst hotel in which I've ever had the (un)privilege of experiencing. In my more than fifteen years of travelling I don't that I've ever actually starting crying in the hotel room because the hotel room was so terrible. Upon arriving on the late morning of Tuesday, March 13, 2012, the valet was most helpful. We found parking quick and easy. (Although the parking garage needs some much brighter lighting; the parking felt a bit unsafe it was so dark down there.) The front desk girl was happy, smiled, and greeted us warmly. She upgraded us from a $130 room to a corner suite with a king bed for $30 more. Oh, and parking is an additional $35. So, total cost: $190. (We booked through Hotwire, but I've started noticing a trend lately: hotels at which you a book a room via Hotwire more often than tend to have a negative, slightly-unwelcome attitude toward you than their other guests. The Renaissance was one of those hotels.) The room on the fifth floor was clean. Cosy. A bit dark. The room was a north-east facing room, overlooking the: I-5 highway. The bed was clean. Everything was nice and fine. This was the afternoon when we checked in. We went out for dinner and returned around 10 PM. The noise from the I-5â€”which has got to be at least 9 lanes of traffic across is itâ€”was absolutely DEAFENING! It was so bad that my wife had to turn up the TV and I had to grab a blanket and sleep on the couch in the room furthest away from the bedroom. Lame. The noise was still bad, but after much exhaustion in trying to get comfortable on a couch made for a child, and the noise that never stopped, I finally fell asleep. I actually contemplated sleeping in my car in that dark parking garage to get away from the non-stop sound of traffic. At 3 AM, I awoke and went to the bedroom. Still the noise from the never-ending traffic outside was so overwhelming I had to go back to the couch. So, there I slept, for probably 5 hours and not much more, thanks to the hotel room. Why are there double-paned glass windows on a hotel that faces a freeway? Why did the check-in girl not ask us if we wanted a room facing the freeway? Why did the girl at the front desk upon check-out the next morning not ask us how are stay was? Well, if you and your hotelâ€™s owners want to know what we thought of our stay, just read my story above. Oh, and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Ever. I will never use this chain of hotels again and I and my wife will most likely never use Hotwire again. That was just a lame experience in an otherwise beautiful city.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126046881">Really enjoyed staying downtown Seattle.

I was a little worried after some of the reviews I'd read. Lots of people complained about the workout facilities; we don't go on vacation to work out so we never went anywhere near that so I cna't comment on that. As far as the actual room goes, we requested a room on the west side away from the hotel and as high up as they could get us, and were given a room facing west on the 20th floor. It had a great view of the modern library, many of the tall downtown building and water (I don't think it's the sound, just an inlet or lake or something). We didn't hear any traffic noise up there; what we did hear (and this is something you'd hear anywhere that high up I think) is the wind on one particularly windy day. It still wasn't enough to wake us up or anything. The room was very clean and all of the staff: the front desk clerks, the bartenders, the doormen, the lovely concierges - were fantastic! The bed was very comfortable as well. I think the location was great too. It's about a 15 minute walk down to Pike market and the front desk clerk advised us to walk over to Pike on 5th so that we didn't have to deal with going up or down the massive hill that runs right by the hotel (it's not nearly as severe going down Pike). We didn't have a car, just walked everywhere and nothing seemed to terribly far away. If you do want to take a cab to Pike's Market (we were running late for a tour and had to get there quickly), the doorman will hail one for you and it's only about $6 for the trip down there. I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124937308">In a good location with easy walking to centre,pike place mkt, art gallery and pioneer square.

It was a very pleasant stay, just not sure it was 4 Star as Priceline rates it. In reading other reviews of this property - I was surprised about people who complained that internet is charged... (I stay at many nicer properties similar and everyone charges it) but what got me.. was it was $12.95 per item (so my iPhone and laptop would be $26 per night) and I didn't bother getting it at all. Would I stay at another Marriott? Probably, given that this was the first time at one (I'm usually at Westin or other Starwoods) but - would I book through the hotel website? Probably not. It was Columbus Day weekend, and a parking spot was difficult to find, and manouvering around in the mornings was difficult given that the shortage of parking spots made people park in down ramps, or anywhere in the parkade. Also there was a bad storm, and staying high made for wind to go through the window frames (not enough window sealant) and not sure what would have been quieter... traffice noise from the I-5 or the other side with the high winds. I was surprised with the actual size of the room however - the benefits of an older hotel versus a newly built one.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124921947">Booked this hotel for a week long conference where my husband came along for a much needed break and we had a wonderful stay here. Staff were all great and the room service was perfect. We ate most of our meals in the hotel restaurant and have to say a huge thank you to Robert and Mark for the best service ever!!! The only complaints we have is that the room TV screen seems to be set on the wrong setting as the picture is very distorted and the rooms air conditioner allows the sound of the outside wind to come into the room and it was extremely loud where we had trouble sleeping over it and our final comment....the parking cost is outrageous at $30 a night plus $6 car tax...$36 for a staying guest is just way too much to add onto the price of your room each night. Other than the points mentioned we had a wonderful time here and it was within walking distance to everything we needed and the hills were not too bad to walk as some mentioned.

While the Renaissance is considered "downtown" it's kinda a reach to say so, it's right on the end and literally right on the highway. So if you're hoping to do a little shopping downtown expect to either cab it back to the hotel or walk quite a few blocks with bags in your hands. The hotel has been renovated beautifully, the lobby is gorgeous, even the rooms have been renovated nicely..but there's one thing I wouldn't have thought of prior to staying here, and that I've never ever experienced in a hotel in Seattle before. The building is built on springs....I believe for the sake of earthquakes etc. which isn't a problem other than you will hear the ear piercing, and CONSTANT sound of the building swaying and screeching throughout the night with the same rhythm as the wind. After trying to figure out this noise for about 3 hours..we finally called the front desk and they explained all of the above, of course there isn't much they can do about the construction of the building which is understandible, but she kindly offered us earplugs, which we used and finally slept through the remainder of the evening. This also helped drown out the noise of the highway traffic. On a positive note, there are some great restaurants within a nice walk from the hotel, we enjoyed a beautiful dinner at Elliot's on the pier and were able to walk there. The staff were quite nice, the security out front was more than accomodating and offered us directions and an umbrella. It's a nice hotel, that they are definately doing their best with it, but it is older, and the location didn't fit our needs this time around, but for quick accomodations right off the highway on a not so windy day may be worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124762703">My family and I booked this hotel through hotwire and received a great rate. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle and is walking distance to Pike's market, the aquarium and many other local tourist attractions. The room itself was nice and included a king size bed, flat screen tv and mini fridge. We were on the 19th floor on the highway side and the noise from the highway was present, but ignorable. Parking was $30/night and since our vehicle didn't fit in the self park, we received one night of valet parking at the self park rate. The desk staff and door men/valet were all very friendly and helpful. The costs of staying at a hotel like this add up: $30 for parking, $15 for internet + tips etc. If budgeting a stay, make sure to include these costs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124693377">We were on foot for a romantic week touring Seattle and found this hotel to be a good value for a 6 night stay near downtown with nice amenities. The good: -Nice lobby/lower lounge area and extremely helpful staff -The R-View lounge on the top floor has fantastic views of the city at less than space needle prices. The intimate size makes for a romantic setting. -Right next to the library, which we though was pretty cool. -There are a lot of good in house dining options for a hotel of this price and the food is not Hilton-unaffordable The bad: -If there is a big conference on, the way that the elevators are programmed means you will never get one (prompt elevators w/o conference present) -There is a bit of road noise no matter where you are in the hotel it seems -We enjoyed the location in close proximity to major city sites and did not mind the exercise of the extra hill climbing on foot, however, less fit car-less patrons may not appreciate this hotel's lofty location. The ugly: I think it needs to be clarified that THIS HOTEL DOES NOT HAVE A POOL. I was reading conflicting reports, some raving about a pool and some even including pictures. Other internet searches confirmed the existence of a pool and when I called to ask the front desk prior to booking the woman told me (in an unnecessarily condescending voice, very atypical of the helpful staff we encountered once on site) that there was NOT a pool. I explained that I was only asking because I had seen reports of a pool in online posts about the hotel and she acted as if I was incapable of internet usage. In fact, upon hunting around the hotel we did find the NOW CLOSED top floor pool. Based on the woman's insistence about the nonexistent pool, the stickers blocking out the pool in the hotel in-room brochure and the current state of the pool as viewed through the papered over glass window that once led to it there are no plans for this hotel to have a pool again any time soon. Which is a shame because it looked very nice. They must be very upset about it's departure as well considering they now appear to no longer acknowledge it once existed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124291386">The hotel was good the only minor descrepancy and that was due to the location late eveings you could hear the heavy traffic.

If you're a tourist and without a car, you might not be too happy. I was visiting a company a block a way so it was perfect. I took the light rail in from the airport. It's reasonably fast and convenient, but be prepared for a steep uphill walk to the hotel. If you walk anywhere you'll encounter the hills. If this will be a problem, do not stay here. Every individual I came in contact with was friendly and helpful, from the doorman to the concierge. My corner king room was more of a suite and very pleasant with a nice view and separate temperature control in the living area and sleeping area. The 28th floor fitness center has newer cardio machines and some basic free weights and weight machines. There are multiple restaurants in the hotel, though one isn't open for dinner year-round. My choices were the lobby bar or the 29th floor restaurant. Both have limited menus, and if you want an quick, light, healthy meal, you won't find it. I did find a Subway sandwich shop a couple of blocks away. As others have noted, internet access is $12.95 per day. Mine was free due to my Marriott elite status. But the connection was so slow that I couldn't do some of my online work. I'd have been very upset if I'd been paying for it. Even worse is the incredible sloppiness in attention to detail. One of my room keys didn't work. I didn't get the newspaper I requested. I didn't get my wake up call. Add this to noisy HVAC (hard to sleep through) and cheapness (you only get two cups of coffee, not the customary four) and the overall sense is negative.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123849462">I stayed at the Renaissance for just one night, but that was more than enough. There were a few pleasant surprises (namely the ability to print airline boarding passes in the lobby and great sweet potato fries at the bistro), and the location is convenient, but overall the visit was disappointing. This current Priceline description has several inaccuracies: The 28-story Renaissance has 553 spacious rooms, with the upper-floor rooms boasting views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, Cascade or Olympic Mountains. Rooms come with mini-fridges, coffee/tea makers, Wi-Fi (for a fee in room, free in lobby), windows that open and flat-panel TVs with premium cable. You'll love flopping onto this bed after a day of Seattle sightseeing. It has a pillowtop mattress, down comforter and cotton-rich linens with triple sheeting. No belly-flopping in the pool: Take a refreshing swim around the splash pool and a soak in the hot tub on the 28th floor, with views of the bay. You also get expansive views of Elliott Bay, the Space Needle, and the surrounding city from the 28th-floor restaurant and bar. The hotel also has parking (for a fee), a fitness center, second restaurant and lobby coffee bar and lounge. Sounds good. And the windows DO open a bit, the bed is comfortable, and the night views are pretty. Unfortunately, there is no splash pool/hot tub (despite signs in the hotel elevators that also point you to the 28th floor pool). According to the front desk folks, they're being turned into more meeting rooms. That would have been nice to know BEFORE arriving. Also, the water in our bathtub reached warm, but not hot, even when I turned it to max hot. As I didn't have hours to spend with a hotel engineer, I used the coffee maker's hot water to heat up the bath. Servicable, but hardly "luxurious." Also, from 3 to 6 am, our room on the 21st floor made loud creaking noises that actually woke (and kept) me up. (Apparently, according to the woman at the front desk, the hotel is built on rollers, so whenever it's windy out ... it moves and creaks). And then there's that flat screen TV. The picture was poor and the "Daily Special" movies listed for $4.99 were actually $13.99 when I you get to the purchase screeen. I called downstairs and they said: "That's a separate company and they did have that daily deal, but I guess it's over ... but we can't get them to change the menu. So the price is $13.99.) One thing goes wrong, OK. Two, not great, but livable. No pool, no hot water, interrupted sleep, and bait-and-switch movie prices? C'mon, Renaissance, you can do better than that.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123809225">This Marriott hotel has a gym and a decent coffee shop, but it is farther from the city center shopping area and Pike Place Market than many other hotels.

The views are good, but mostly of other buildings rather than the Sound or the Space Needle. I bring my dog who likes to look out the window and watch the cats in the highrise condos nearby.

About $166 with taxes from HotWire. Parking was $30 plus a $6 Parking tax. 3. Location: Other than being next to a highway, the location is fairly good. Close to Capital Hill and the downtown area. 4. Amenities: We had drink sand appies in the lounge and the beer was good and not too expensive. Food was average. The lounge was a nice touch and they had a great singer performing. Free wifi in this area. 5. Room: The room was a decent size. The pillows were not comfortable. The room did show some age. 6.

The kindness and friendliness of the staff is just unprecedented. I mean where do I start; from the sea-view room upgrade right off the bat, to getting 5 days of internet for free and finally the complementary last-day late check-out cuz I didn't get much sleep the night before. It obviously met the other regular standards: prime location (going downhill at least), clean room, comfy beds, flat screen, pool, hot tub and a small 'gym'. They also have a knowledgeable and competent concierge that helped make out the best of our time.

Instead, the hidden fees brought the cost from the initially "great deal" of $99/night up to around $158/night. The $22/night room tax, the $30/night parking fee + $6/night parking tax plus the very noisy room facing I-5 ensured that we will not be back. The extra $13/night for wifi was just plain gouging. When we heard the cost, we elected to not bother. Seriously? An up-charge for wifi? Nickel-and-dime your customers much? The icing on the cake was a Saturday night visit to the hotel bar for a drink. Two singles of blended scotch (the cheap stuff) started at $11/drink before tax, and ended up at nearly $30 after a modest tip was added. $30 for two drinks? Booooo. Down with Renaissance.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR121788116">We got a last minute deal at this 4 star hotel, and while the room itself was very nice, we were not very satisfied with our experience. It was a bit of a walk from the downtown core, the hotel parking costs were double that of a 3 1/2 star hotel, and there was an extra charge for wifi in our room. It was a busy weekend, and it took forever to get anywhere in the elevators (there are 6) due to long waits for an elevator, then to multiple stops on each trip. In addition, our car had to be valet-parked offsite as it was "overheight" (it was over 6'2"), and they left it on the street outside the hotel entrance for over 5 hours at night as they were "very busy" and "hadn't had time to take it" over to to other garage. IT only got moved after we brought it to their attention. We won't be going back to this hotel, as we have stayed just as nice rooms in Seattle for the same price with a more suitable slate of options.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121739813">I wasn't expecting much from a large chain hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room was pretty standard in size and furnishings, but comfortable with no problems at all. The shower was very nice with Aveda soaps and amenities. Room service was prompt and delivered with a good attitude. I thought it was a good value for the relatively low price I paid. It's a couple extra blocks away than other major hotels from tourist sites like Pike, space needle, and the waterfront, but it was convenient for my work near Pioneer Square. I recommend it for the common business traveler and tourist alike who are looking for a standard room with nice amenities.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR121680235">My wife and I stayed here for a random Saturday night out of the house getaway. Everything at the hotel was great when it comes down to amenities and cleaniness. The location of the property is not as great as some of the other dowtown hotels if you are looking to go out shopping or out to the bars at night. The east side of the building borders the I-5 so it could get noisy on some of the lower floors. Their roof top lounge also has a great Happy Hour menu and is a good place to just hang out, have a couple of drinks, and to watch Seattle from the top. That being said I would totally reccomend this hotel to other travelers until we checked out of this property. Right after we left downtown, my wife realized she forgot her hair conditioner that she just picked up at a salon the night before. She called the operator and was told that the room hasn't been cleaned yet and that they'll send a security guard up there to pick it up for us. Once we came back with in 30 minutes of the call I went up to the front desk to pick it up, the attendant seemed to know right away what I was talking about and flat out told me that the room has been cleaned and they had nothing for me.... I asked what would housekeeping do with a huge 1.25 L bottle of conditioner, that's hard to miss, he said he wouldn't know and he did not let me go upstairs and check out the room to see if maybe they missed it. He did not seem to care about my concern at all, and he caused me to have a bad "after taste" from staying here. I don't think we will ever consider staying here again, or even come up to the RView for drinks. I would hate to forget something of value here...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR121476601">Wow, their are so many positive reviews, sadly my experience was quite the opposite,here goes... 1. To begin with $30 parking fee - No issues paying it, BUT, if I am paying I expect to be able to park there! We were there on a Saturday and there was an event so the hotel opens up the parkade to daily parkers in addition to hotel guests. Due to this we could not find any parking after going in circles for 15-20mins. We let the valet know the situation and they said they would take the car for us which helped at that time. We did speak to the manager about this and about the parkade safety since they had cars all over the place including on the ramp (which was a major safety hazard since we almost got hit twice ) The manager waived our parking fees and gave us the whole I understand speech (that is why I rated the hotel 2 stars, the customer service shown by the manager) 2. The beds in this hotel were by far horrible, for lack of a better word the beds were ``springy`` I have stayed at other Marriotts but never had beds like this. To boot the pillows were very very hard. Did not get a good night sleep at all! 3. The hot tub jets were not working and the front desk claimed to not have known about this, which was odd since there was a sign stating that they did not work. Spoke to a housekeeping employee and they mentioned that the hot tub had been like that for sometime. Overall it was a horrible experience and I would never stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121463276">The staff at this hotel was very helpful. They were accommodating to our request for a room on a higher floor. The lounge downstairs was very nice for a cocktail after a long day of sight seeing. it is a bit of a walk to the wharf area but no more than 5-10 minutes. It sits at the top of a hill so it is so easy going down there but harder coming back. The rooms were very nice and had everything we needed for our stay.

Tonja was very helpful and friendly and got us in adjoining rooms on an upper level floor. Hotel is located in the business area, but the free bus took us just about everywhere we wanted. The restaurant on the 26th floor was a great place to sit and relax during happy hour, The view of the Space Needle and Christmas lights was gorgeous. We discovered a new wine, the food was good and the service very friendly. We could see the highway from our room, but heard nothing all night because of the white noise from a fan in the room. The pool and whirlpool were nice. Everyone in the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The beds were firm as others have said, but not overly so. The bedding was very comfortable; empty refrigerator in the room was appreciated; the showers were lovely; Aveda products were nice. We had a fabulous stay at the Renaissance and would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121230853">I was in town for a concert with my girl firend, overall nice experience. The hotel is located in the middle of business district and next to the library. The hotel lobby has nice welcome feel. The front desk staff was very welcoming, inform us of live music at the bar that evening and provided direction when needed. At one point room door ran out of battery and we had to call for both an engineer and security. The wait was longer than expected (20 minutes), with that said the staff were friendly and enjoyable to talk to. The good: - Very friendly staff - Room and hotel is clean and welcoming. - Average sized room and bathroom The not so good: - The lack of easy pickup and drop off area (itâ€™s just side of road) - The Cost of Parking - Internet is not free Overall itâ€™s a nice hotel for short stay or for business. As a tourist this might be out of the way from most attractions.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120959384">This hotel is located in the business area of Seattle, next to the Library, and surrounded with skyscrapers. We enjoyed our stay, probably because we were on the "right" side, that is to say, facing the river, not the freeway. Our room was large and very pleasant, the view stunning, but I found the bed a little hard for my taste. Employees were friendly and very helpful. There is a pool and a good exercise room upstairs, as well as a restaurant with great views. Downstairs, a cafe offers basic breakfast and lunch, nothing imaginative, but the choice of cafes in the area is very limited. Ask for a room away from the freeway, and you will be happy with your stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120429068">From the moment we walked in, we were rather impressed with the service. We had high floor and quiet room. The room met our expectations for a usual 4 to 5 star hotel. But I would rate this hotel at most 4 star aiming (but not there yet) to be a 5 star. You can tell there isn't enough thought put into the room amenities e.g. no disposable room slippers, and no kettle! The bar fridge was empty too. Internet cost extra so was a bummer unless you go to the lobby. Hotel was updated but not everything e.g. lifts are still quite old, light switches in the room is also the old type. Sofa in the room also did not look like the new funky type. Parking at hotel is expensive but you can do free street parking at night but do remember to remove it or pay for it from 8 am - they are rather punctual and strict about it. Rather inconvenient in you need to go to the corner store (convenience store) for anything at night because the closest one is like 5 blocks away. Hotel would suit more the business type but if you're on vacation and can get a good deal, would highly recommend.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120426993">the lack of customer service I have received from this hotel about cancelling my reservation, within 12 hours of booking through another site is shocking. The other site (that will also get a well deserved review) has put the entire blame on the hotel who has done absolutely nothing to defend themselves.

The hotel is a classy property that appears geared toward the business traveler. The hotel was clean with nice amenities, including Aveda products. We enjoyed a visit to the lounge one evening. The hotel's location made it an easy walk to many popular downtown venues. The big downside: the beds. We had a room with 2 double beds, beds that should not be shared. The mattresses in our room were certainly in need of replacing.

Overall the hotel property is okay and for being in downtown Seattle the price I paid on priceline was a bargain $115/night. The inhouse workout room and nice treadmills and a full set of dumbells, however the other workout machines needed repair, gym was small. Pool had stong smell of chlorinates. *Internet should have been free, for $13/night, it was s-l-o-w. *Parking was tight and expensive $30night for self park (however compared to parking elsewhere this is probably standard fee. *access to I-5 was convenient *Maxwells restuarant had nice breakfast buffet, 3 newspapers to pick from and a very friendly staff. *Overall staff was very helpful, friendly and actually seemed to enjoy their work. Rooms were clean and diligent housekeeping service. *tv picture in room was not HD, small channel selection In my opinion this is a value property if you can get it through priceline, however add $43/night to compare with another facility ( if you get free internet and parking).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120315755">The hotel was conveniently located, walking distance to all areas of downtown Seattle. The room was a touch on the small side. The bed was comfortable. There was an empty bar fridge included which was nice. Most hotels provide a fridge full of overpriced goods. No complimentary slippers. In downtown Seattle parking is free on Sundays, but the spots are taken up quickly. We stayed Sat &amp; Sun night, we paid $8.00 to park from 6PM to 8PM Sat nite while spots were available. On Sun nite we prepaid $8.00 to park from 8AM to 10AM on Mon. The result was $16.00 to park from 6PM Sat to 10AM Mon. This saved approximately $45.00 in parking. Ask for a room away from the Interstate. Ask for a room on a lower floor (6th), this will allow you to use the complimentary wireless internet provided in the lobby saving $12 or so per day (ask the front desk for the password).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR120290714">The hotel has a very nice design and look to it. My husband and I went for a conference at the hotel. Our room didn't have as many cable channels so being alone in the room at night while he was at a meeting, I didn't enjoy the choices. Also the bed was horrible. We had a king sized bed and both of us slept horribly. Our over 20 year old mattress at home was nicer! The workout room on the top floor was really nice with good equipment. I ate at their restaurant for breakfast which was good and not too expensive.

It is clean, comfortable, and centrally located to downtown businesses. However, if you are a tourist, I would suggest finding a hotel that is cheaper, offers free wi-fi and breakfast, and doesn't involve a steep hill. (Although the latter seems to be a given in Seattle -- it feels like everything is uphill both ways!) Overall this hotel is great if someone else (like your company) is footing the bill. If it's your own dime, I am sure you can find clean, comfortable and a central location for less.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119923147">As people have described, right off the highway in front of a one way street. In terms of hotels, very comparable to the Westin and Sheraton. Location Not much around the hotel, except for the highway and a Bartell Drugs 2 blocks down on 4th avenue. This huge store is a great place to get almost anything you need (snacks, toys, toiletries, organic milk!). And yes, it is a steep hill down to the water, so watch out when it's raining because it can get slippery! Pike Market is 15-20 minute walk away, all down hill. The Sheraton is about 10-15 minutes away to Market, so just a tad closer. When you're coming back to the hotel from the Market, definitely go up Pike Street to avoid the steep incline, it's more gradual (turn right on 6th avenue to hit the hotel). It's a pleasant walk through City Center with all its shops and restaurants (Cheesecake Factory, HMV, Ross, etc). Definitely on the outskirts of downtown, it'll be a walk to hit the popular areas. If you want to be right in the middle of the action as soon as you leave the front door, stay at the Sheraton. We didn't mind the location. Parking As with all other hotels in Seattle, you pay for it. Self park is in a secure garage (in and out privileges with your room key- all automated) is $30 plus tax ($36 total). One night we overheard that self parking was full and only valet was available. The garage seemed secure enough. Plus, there's one elevator (kind of small) that takes you straight up to the lobby. Check In Smooth, accepted my request for a room away from the highway as per other posts suggestions. Room Located on the 15th floor, views of the apartment building across from us. Good people watching. They had their blinds open, so we could see them making dinner, watching tv, etc. Nice apartments! Good size, comparable with Westin and Sheraton. Very nice decor, modern dark woods. Flat screen TV. We requested 2 doubles. Bathroom was standard sized, very clean. We liked the Aveda products. Unfortunately no free Wi-Fi. Beds were fine, no major complaints. Lobby Live band Friday night in the lounge area. Packed with people. Concierge was nice, let us borrow an umbrella. Overall Good hotel. Quality of room and hotel is good, on par with other 4 star hotels in the area. Only thing is that you're a bit far from the action. If you're ok with that, then this place is totally fine. We wouldn't mind staying here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119868007">The staff is really cordial and polite. If you stay here ask for a room that does not face te highway, because the windows are a single glass and it might be very noisy, specially during week mornings.

For a full service hotel in downtown Seattle I thought this was an excellent bargain. The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The location is convenient and and easy walk to many attractions, museums and restaurants. I personally had a room on the 8th floor and thought that there was a bit too much road noise coming from the street. If I ever go back, I will ask for a higher floor. The bar on the 28th floor has an amazing view on a clear night. You don't want to miss it!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119537982">This is one of the more dilapidated and rundown Renaissance hotels that I have stayed in. The hotel feels more like a mid-tier level than what one would expect from one of the flagship Marriott properties. If you are paying full price (i.e. not Priceline, Hotwire, etc.)...look somewhere else. Personally, for $150+/night, I would recommend the Sheraton. Like other reviewers have noted, the Renaissance is not exactly convenient to most of the downtown attractions. The hotel is up on a hill about 5-6 blocks from the closest attraction. Its not horrible...but the Sheraton and others are closer. I got this hotel via Priceline...and I felt that the Priceline price was more acceptable given the rundown condition of the hotel. The Renaissance lacks a dedicated lobby entrance (i.e. place to pick up taxis, etc.) and I felt every time I went outside for a taxi was an adventure in and of itself. Be prepared to be hit up by "private" limos instead of the usual taxis. I made this mistake...once. You will not get a good deal with the private car. It almost feels like the parking staff out front is getting a kick back. As others have noted...this hotel has to have the oldest elevators known to mankind. Seriously...I thought I was on the Tower of Terror ride at Disney. My room was adequate but nothing special. This is a good Priceline hotel...but spend your full $ at a location closer to downtown attractions with amenities more fitting the price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119487034">I should begin this review by saying that the frontline staff (from front desk, to bell hop, to wait staff) have been wonderful. My displeasure has much more to do with the food and amenities which just aren't up to Renaissance standards. The rooms themselves are very nice -- lots of easily accessible outlets, remodeled and clean bathrooms, linens etc. Complaint 1: the breakfast in either the restaruant or the consierge lounge is really meager. Today the buffet included: scrambled eggs, waffle quarters, bacon/sausage, oatmeal and potatoes, yogurt, pineapple, cantaloupe, grapes, strawberries, sandwich bread for toasting and some pastries. Cheerios or cornflakes. That's it. Seattle is a rather international city. Where is the salmon? Where is the European style cold cuts? Is it not possible to find higher quality bread? (The concierge lounge was worse. The only protein there were hard boiled eggs). I know this sounds like I'm spoiled, but I've stayed at a significant number of Renaissance hotels in the past year: Milan, Zurich, Las Vegas, Bankok, etc. and I found all of their breakfast buffets to be mouth watering. This one reminded me of a tired dining hall. Complaint 2: Amenities in the form of exercise room is the other thing lacking. Actually it isn't lacking so much as it has not kept pace with demand. At 5:20 the other morning every single machine was taken! At 6:30 this morning, -- same thing. There are a total of 7 machines (5 treadmills) one elliptical and a bike or stair stepper. Basically the place was bursting at the seams and the poor AC could not keep up. So it was like exercising in a sauna. I have to give them credit for having really nice machines though -- built in TV in each one. On the good side though ,this hotel has a 2 lane lap pool on the 28th floor! Not a common thing.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119415207">I booked this hotel on priceline for $88 a night. For the money I paid, I could not have been more pleased!! However, if I had paid the full price of $150+, I would not have been so happy. The lobby was trendy and relaxing. The staff very friendly and helpful. But when I stepped on the elevator, I became concerned of what I had gotten myself into. The elevators are old and remind me of what you see in a horror movie before the hotel becomes haunted :-) Aside from the lobby, the entire hotel has an old, musty smell. The carpet is frayed along the seems, and the paint needs to be scraped and re-done. The hardware (door handles, hinges, etc) need replacing, as do the windows and window hardware. There was a weird ledge underneath all the windows in my room that just looked tacky. The TV in the bedroom sat on the ledge rather than having a TV stand/armoire...again, tacky. The TVs were LCD flat panels, but had poor quality pictures due to the awful signal they were receiving. It was a shame to have nice TVs but have such poor picture quality. The windows cracked open about 4 inches which let in some nice fresh afternoon air, but had to be closed at night due to the expected downtown noise. Upon check in I requested a room with a nice view of the sound. The man at the front desk upgraded me to a King Corner Suite! I was surprised considering I had booked my room through priceline. I certainly can't complain about my room, especially since I only paid $88 a night AND got a free suite upgrade. However, if I had paid full price, I would be quite disappointed in the quality of the room. The TV in the sitting area was not straight and looked as if it was going to fall off the wall. The cables from the TV hung down the wall in a haphazard way. The sofa in the sitting area was not meant to be sat on! It was old, uncomfortable, and just ackward. The suite had a small refrigerator with complimentary bottles of water. It also had a coffe maker with (awful) coffee and a wonderful tea assortment. There was a safe and iron/ironing board. I found it odd that in a king suite they only provided one bath robe, but I'm sure if I had requested another they would have provided it. The bathroom was the most up to date part of the room. It was obvious the majority of their recent renovation budget was focused on the bathrooms. I found it odd that the door was on a sliding track, similar to a pocket door. It provided little privacy from the rest of the room. The tub was small and would have been nice to have a seperate tub and shower instead of a combination. I loved the mirror and lighting in the bathroom!! And the Aveda toiletries were a nice compliment as well. The bed was comfortable, not great, not horrible. The bedroom had a view of the Space Needle, Lake Union, Puget Sound, Qwest and Safeco fields, and in the far distance UW (if you know what you're looking for). :-) Overall, it was a good hotel for the price I paid. The location wasn't great for downtown tourist attractions, but it wasn't horrible either. Don't plan on walking back to the hotel alone after dark, however. There were many questionable people on the streets after dark. It felt a bit out of the tourist area, but still within a 15 minute walk to Pike Place, Benaroya Hall, Game Works, the movie theater, and shopping. There is also a free bus route that runs through downtown. It picks up every half hour right across the street from the hotel! It is best to catch a bus back to the hotel as the walk back is on a significant incline.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119378411">Friendly staff, and generally a good vibe here.

The pool and hot tub are nothing special, the gets in the hot tub are poorly placed and not very soothing. It is literally right off the highway, I did not notice noise because my room was not on that side of the hotel, but i have heard of others complaining of the noise. It is close enough for younger people to walk to the attractions downtown (we are in our 20s), but it you can't handle hills, then you may want to drive to your attractions.

We even had handwritten thank you notes from the room cleaning staff for our tips! Breakfast is very good and in a pleasant, sun-filled space with exceptional, upbeat servers. An example of this hotel's level of service is that I left a few things in the room when I checked out; when I realized almost a week later that I'd done this, I called them and they located my things (for which they had no responsiblity, of course), then sent them to me back in Boston (thank you, Patricia!).

Poor location, Multi-lane freeway on the east side and high rise buildings on the west side that completely block the view to Puget Sound, and a long downhill-uphill walk to restaurants/shopping. Furniture in the room tired. Flat Screen TV but not high definition, always annoying. Small refrigerator did not work. Poor lighting in bathroom which is good if you don't want a close look at your face. Service very uneven,newspaper outside door on some days not on others, same with evening service to room. No material in room on TV and hotel amenities.Don't plan to eat here because it is difficult to figure out which restaurants are open at what times. If you are a Marriott rewards member, as I am, you will have a much better experience at the Downtown Residence Inn at Lake Union.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118439371">Unlike other reviewers we found this hotel very functional. It is quite plain when you enter the lobby but the staff were really friendly. When we got our room keys we were very pleasantly surprised at the size of it, and the size of the bed! It would have slept 3 people comfortably. There was lots of space to relax and there was a chair with a foot rest. It is downhill from the hotel to the shoreline which means of course, that it is uphill back, but if you walk across another couple of streets and then return, it isn't nearly so steep, and we are in our late 60s, so if we can manage it I don't know what others are whingeing about! The freeway is close by and we could hear it slightly from our room but it didn't disturb us at all. We were also able to buy breakfast in the cafe/restaurant on the second floor and it was very good. The concierge staff were also very helpful especially when we needed to print our boarding passes. So all-in-all, we think this a good hotel for a couple of nights.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118418966">Compared to other, newer hotel properties in the area, the Renaissance is falling behind, without much hope of catching up. Its location, on the edge of downtown, right next to the freeway. If you have a room on that side of the hotel, the noise is easily discernible. The rooms are fine, very much up to Renaissance's standards. However, I won't be back, unless the room deal is too good to pass up. One last note . . . The evening desk jockey is way, way too annoying and discourteous. Witness: After checking in around midnight, I get a call from him at 12:30 a.m., when I'm already in bed, asking about the room. I understand that's what his book tells him he's supposed to do, but 12:30 a.m.? Really?<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118394051">Pretty average place only really worthy of a 3 diamond rating. my wife was annoyed with the concierge on multiple occasions because of snobbishness. expect to pay an extra 30 dollars on top of your room rate for nightly parking. as with most hotels now everything is an extra and costs money. for the cost we would likely stay at the fairmont or hyatt next time<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118324997">Stayed here for 4 nights for a conference. Hotel staff was extremely knowledgeable of the area and quite professional. I was upgraded to a 2 room suite on the 25th floor upon arrival with access to the club lounge on the 26th floor. The view I had from the 25th floor was amazing. Could see the water front from one window and the Space Needle from the other and what a spectacular sky line Seattle offers at night. This hotel is located about 1/2 a mile from Pikes Place Market the Water Front and the First Starbucks. The walk down is great and when I say down i mean down. Returning to the hotel was straight up hill but worth the effort in my opinion. Despite having complimentary breakfast in the club lounge I did eat one morning in the restaurant and it was a basic buffet or you could order off the menu if you have the time I would recommend walking to the water front to find breakfast. Did have room service one night. A basic Turkey Club with Fries and water. Was about 20.00 including tip so not so bad for room service. I gave the server a couple of extra bucks but he was not expecting it. My only complaint with this hotel was the Elevators seemed to be running slow. Not sure if they were all working or what but it was a small inconvenience. This will definitely be my hotel for future stays in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118180360">The hotel is close to the metro, so it was easy to find and get to from the Airport. It is situated somewhat in the middle of all the attractions. close enough to pike, and close enough to the bank of america tower. The room was clean, comfortable, with a nice view of the city. I especially like the fact that you can print out your boarding passes downstairs at the business center. Overall a great hotel to call home while touring the city built above another city.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118178326">Stayed here Sept.3rd thru 6th 2011. I loved this hotel. The lobby was beautiful. The staff was great. Friendly &amp; helpful.Allowed us to check in about 10:00 am.The room was large. Stayed on the 26th floor. A fantastic view ,especially at night.Beds were comfortable, medium firmness. Tv had good selection of stations. Internet was fast enough for watching videos online. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the 2nd floor for 2 days. Outstanding. But I do have 2 complaints. The first is minor. I didn't really care for the bathroom doors. They are made of white glass that you can partially see through (silhouettes). For most people this might not be a problem, but for families or friends sharing a room , it might. Also when someone goes to the bathroom at night ,it lights up the whole room. Plus they are sliding doors. The second complaint is the cost of parking. $30. a day plus $6 &amp; change tax on the parking. This reminds me of the luggage fees that airlines charge. I prefer just to have the full price upfront, please. This hotel is in a good location for walking around the city. But I do recommend going down 6th to Pike to get where you want to go, as it is a lot less steep. Also recommend the Mod Pizza place on 6th for an inexpensive meal. Even with my 2 complaints , I do recommend this hotel. I really enjoyed my time there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118176875">Great place to stay, close to the pier and Pikes Market.

Caught the train down from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, Washington. What a great way to relax and enjoy the trip. Fantastic views and easy travel. Arrived in Seattle, and after a minimal taxi fare to our hotel started the trip. As we arrived and everyday after, the staff at this hotel were exceptional. Any questions we had about Seattle and the surrounding area were easily answered. The staff was very friendly , courteous and went out of their way to make sure our stay there was enjoyed. Accomodations were also tops. The restaurant / Bar made dinner and a cocktail and experience as you viewed from the 28th floor a gorgeous city. Can't wait to make a weekend Seahawks/Mariners game now. Pike place was a 15-20 minute walk down the hill and not at all difficult. In fact we walked everywhere and had little or no difficulty with anything. If you get tired the cab fare up to the hotel from the market was again, minor.The walk up the hill could be a bit difficult for elderly patrons, but we learned after the first day to weave up the hill. This introduced us to even more shops and stores and we became more aware of the area. All in all a great trip and a great hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118069743">Stayed at Renaissance for one night on Labor day.

The hotel is not close to many shops and such, and not in a busy area, but everything you want is walkable. It was close to the water, pike's market, which is all walking distance. The space needle is also walkable (a bit far probably about 25 minutes, but doable). It is on a hill so the walk does get tiring, - we found that we could walk across and then down the hill if going to the water or pike's market area. This place also has a computer in the lobby to print your flight tickets! Was very excited when I saw this amenity! Very convenient!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117815028">You take a large gamble when you book a room here. Either you will face the busy freeway or you will get lucky and have a quieter room. My first room had two double beds. I had booked a King, so I called for an adjustment. I was re-booked into a King Suite that sat right next to the freeway on the 6th floor. LUCKY ME! I'm exhausted, and now I get to hear the highway traffic all night long. There are wonderful hotel choices in Seattle. Why stay here?!? There are also no restaurants next door that are open past 9 PM on a weekday. I mean, shoot, this is a metropolitan downtown -- any other decent hotel in Seattle will have lots of choices withing walking distance including the Grand Hyatt, where I stayed last time. P.s. The Grand Hyatt has better bathroom amenities and a steam room in their complimentary fitness center.

The hotel is about 8-10 blocks from the water and tourist area's. I wish it were a little closer as within the two block area there were limited choices of entertainment and dining. The room was nice and clean. The beds were comfortable and the desk had plenty of outlets to charge everything. The food at the bar was average and a little below is portion sizes. The beer selection was good and they offered Sam Adams Octoberfest. Overall, I would recommend staying. If I had a choice of a similar hotel closer to the tourist area I would choose that but if not I would stay again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117726659">I stayed here during a convention, with a discounted price. Every single staff member I encountered at the Renaissance was over-the-top friendly and helpful, and that made the stay memorable. It's a pretty good business-class hotel, not as nice as the Seattle Hyatt or Fairmont, but good enough, with very good food in both restaurants, an adequate health club, a very comfortable bed (but not-so-good sound insulation between rooms), a refrigerator in the room, good lighting in the bathroom and good water pressure in the shower. It is a bit of a hike from the downtown center, and that's a disadvantage for a woman on her own in a city that is not very taxi-oriented.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117713408">This was a decent stay.

Took light rail from airport and walked a few blocks to hotel. It is a bit uphill from Univ. stop. Room was very clean and had a mini-fridge which was nice and cold. We went to the Subway about 3 blocks away for dinner. The fitness area was good sized but the next morning it was packed. The pool is tiny but has a great view of the city facing west. Outside of the fitness area to the right was a room/area that was open that had a view facing north. I had heard some people mention the traffic noise - if the a/c is running, you can't hear it, but in the middle of the night when the a/c was off, you certainly did plus the bird that was squaking from somewhere. The staff was friendly enough. The Vikings were staying at our hotel that night prior to the game on Saturday so there were some groupies outside but they were well confined to a certain area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117461671">Admitting, we didn't spend much time in our hotel, and the Renaissance (pretty much) did everything right. We arrived early Friday morning, fresh off a cruise ship and ready to drop off our luggage and freshen up. Fortunately, a room was available. It was nice enough. The bed was very comfy. The chairs and TV were fine. I could do without the sliding/non-latching bathroom door. The concierge was helpful, providing us with a map and suggestions tailored to our limited time and list of sights to see, even printing directions for us to get to one out of the way restaurant. Getting around from the hotel wasn't terribly difficult, though it is in somewhat of a bad location. If you're walking up Madison, the road is very steep uphill. The sites (Pike's Market, Space Needle) are further north, though, so we took the concierge's recommendation to walk down 6th a few blocks to minimize the slope. There are a number of similar hotels closer to all the sites, but the Renaissance was still accessible enough on foot or by bus. Our only real complaint came when housekeeping awakened us at 8:30. We were checking out that day! Why would we need our room made up? We weren't planning on sleeping in too much longer, so it didn't really ruin our day. We booked through Hotwire, spending more than we wanted to, but ultimately, I think it was worth not having to shlep in from outside of town (45 minute train from the much cheaper airport hotels) since we didn't have a ton of time to see everything.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117334403">We stayed at this hotel on the suggestion of a friend.

The room was modern, clean and focused. My room had a nice view of a piece of Seattle (not a panorama -- but a great feeling of being in the city). All eight people on the trip statedpositive comments about their hotel room. A open-area (not walled in but flowed around a corner) restaurant on the lobby area served amazing food -- or you can stop for drinks or good wine. The same area is used in the morning by people for coffee, reading the newspaper or computer time. Very inviting. Service was perfect every time. A favorite small detail of myself and many of my co-workers was a very large table in the lobby/restaurant area at which one could pull up to a piece of it and use as desk or for computer. People would be sitting at different parts of it that did not know each other. Comfortable. I once worked there for about three hours and it was pleasant not being stuck in a room working. The staff were consistently very helpful and very nice. The hotel is walking distance (15 minutes at least) to the famous Pier area and shopping, restaurants, and other attractions. I will stay at this hotel again when I return on business. A general observation -- I have had many consistent and positive experiences at Renaissance hotels in the past two years -- especially in service and food. Our favorite part<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117286003">This is a pretty normal hotel for downtown and the price - nice amenities - pool, bar, cafe, resturant. Beware- it is easily accessible from Interstate 5 but on a very steep hill - do not plan to walk anywhere from the hotel.

I thought the rate was kinda steep (I think we paid $200 a night) The breakfast was good and the employees that work there were so kind and helpful. The enclosed pool/spa was nice on the top floor with a great view. Our room didn't have a memorable view. Our toilet overflowed the 2nd night. (Note to self- alway s wear flip flops or slippers in hotel rooms, you don't know whats been on the carpet.) We changed rooms with help from the bell hop. It's a large hotel and you have to wait a while for the elevators. There is a bus 1 or 2 blocks away that goes straight to the Princess terminal, which is quite far. The bus is 1.50, much cheaper than a taxi.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117159817">We are a couple in our 40's. Stayed for 2 nights. Went to Pike Place, Space Needle, EMP, and various malls and restaurants. Getting around by bus/monorail is very easy. City buses (not monorail) are free until 7pm in the downtown area. Bus stops are located across the street. Go to concierge to get a map and have all this explained to you. Taking the bus is great if walking up and down the hill is a problem. The Renaissance --- Pro's: - Clean, modern room - Great location - Friendly and helpful concierge - Easy check in/out - Booked through Priceline ($128/night) - Comfortable beds - Good toiletries (Aveda) Cons: - Some traffic noise, but it didn't bother us. - Pool was closed. Note, that it is fairly small. - Bathroom door is a sliding frosted panel door, not a pocket door... this door slides from the outside so not exactly very "private". - The two bottles of water in the mini-fridge aren't free. Not knowing... I drank two bottles, but the charges were removed from our bill no problem. - Hotel Parking - $37 (incl tax). - Street parking $4/hour, free after 8pm We arrived at the hotel around 8pm (spent the day at Premium Outlet) - we parked on the street free overnight then moved the car to the hotel parking the next morning for one night. Worked out great to only have to pay for one night of parking! All in all, I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117062124">We had an early morning flight into SeaTac, so brought our luggage to the hotel for storage until check-in. While there, we checked on our reservation and the woman working the front desk first looked surprised that there were three of us, in spite of the fact that the reservation specified three people in a room with two double beds, then said that a room might not be available to accommodate us as the hotel was full. When we asked for clarification, she informed us in an irritated voice that because we had reserved through Orbitz, we were only guaranteed a room and not necessarily the number and types of beds in the room we had specified. Okay, I understand that airlines and hotels overbook because, yes, people flake. However, it is not okay for a staff member to treat paying guests, even those paying a slightly lower rate (the discount's not THAT good), poorly, particularly when their standard practices are what cause the problems in the first place. The desk person in the afternoon who actually checked us into our rooms was more amicable and helpful, and she didn't try to pass the buck when she accidentally checked us into the wrong room. The Renaissance needs to do a better job at training their staff in customer service, or at least hiring people who are service-minded. Other than the inconsistencies with the front desk personnel, the rooms were clean and outfitted in a simple, modest, tailored style. Linens were crisp and comfortable, although I wouldn't buy them for my own home, in spite of the fact that the handy little order forms in the room made it easy to do so. A minor annoyance: the shower curtain liner, rather than being attached by the rings on the rod, attached to the curtain a third of the way down via plastic snaps. I'm guessing it's to make them easier to remove and replace for washing, but the plastic snaps didn't hold very well and the curtain kept unsnapping. A pet peeve: internet access costs extra, unless I want to hover around the conference areas. Bottom line: the Renaissance is updated and clean, but they have not gone the extra mile with regard to amenities or small touches to make it exceptional, and inconsistencies in customer service quality make it fall short of very good.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116968066">I was in Seattle with my family for a couple of days and stayed 3 nights at the Renaissance in a double beds bedroom.

Nothing to get too worked up about either way.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116362112">This is probably going to be one of my most uninspired reviews so far, because the Renaissance was just so that - uninspiring. Let's see...where to begin? The price. Because we are cheap, we booked through Priceline's NYOP and it was the Renaissance that accepted our bid @ $125/night + taxes and fees. Because this was a July weekend, this was about the best deal we could get for a 4* hotel (which, by the way, I would classify this as NOT). The location. The hotel is on Madison between 5th and 6th. This is not a part of the city where I would prefer to be because there is not a lot going on in the immediate vicinity. I have stayed in other hotels in Seattle that are not just more central but also closer to a variety of restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. That said, most of the major attractions are still within walking distance, but be aware that the hotel is on a steep hill, and climbing that hill could conceivably get annoying and tiring pretty quickly. The room. The room we were given was one on the 16th floor that faced the I-5. It was looking a bit tired, but was of an adequate size. While the bed was not the most comfortable bed I have slept in, it was perfectly fine. Some reviewers have complained about the freeway noise, but this did not bother us at all. It was hardly noticeable to us as soon as we closed the window. The bathroom. The bathroom was of a good size, and it was clean. The water pressure in the shower was good, and the water was hot. The toiletries provided were also of a good quality (Aveda). The service. I can't really say much about this because the lady who checked us in barely said more than a few words to us. She just asked for a piece of ID and a credit card, gave us the keys to our room, and asked if we needed a map. She was neither rude nor friendly. She was just very...robot-like. Etcetera. 1. Self-parking is approx $30/day + taxes of almost $7, which is pretty ridiculous. I did see a parking garage on 5th and Madison that charges $24/day, but I am not sure if it is even accessible 24 hrs/day. 2. In-room wifi is available for a charge, but there is free wi-fi in the lobby. 3. I would have liked to have had a drink in the lounge on the 28th floor, but it was closed on a Sunday, which was quite disappointing to say the least. Would I stay here again? Not if I can help it. I say this primarily because of where it is situated, and because I feel that there are better options in Seattle. I would not go and purposely book the Renaissance, and if I ever bid on Priceline again, I would probably cross my fingers and hope to god that a hotel other than this accepts my bid.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116317706">I stayed here with my wife for 5 nights. We actually live an hour away but my company was having meetings in Seattle so it was much easier to stay at the hotel.

The location is excellent if you plan on visiting the court house or the former Bank of America Tower. If not, you might be better off few blocks North of here. It's worth paying the minimal fee to upgrade to club level, the free breakfast you get in return is stellar. Having a pool on the top level is pretty cool (there are even adjacent restrooms with showers, which is nice). The pool, however ,literally had algae growing in the southwest corner during my stay and the pool deck was always dangerously slick.

The room is clean but just at average level.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115633720">Got this twice on hotwire for the 4 star hotel. parking is expensive. but overall the average 4 star hotel. nice pool on the top floor with a little hottub. and a nice work out room. a restarurant all on the top floor. the interenet is pricy but if u go downstairs its free. just a bit of a hassle. concierge is great there. free bus right outside the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115599536">I was here for business (even though I work in this city) and stayed for three nights. The room was well appointed - King bed, 31 inch flat screen TV, desk, chair with ottoman, fridge, safe, and iron. My only complaints about the room (besides the wall hole that was patched but not painted) was the TV is analog (very grainy on certain stations) and the towels and bedding were somewhat scratchy. The bed itself was comfortable and the pillows were great. I didn't have to use wireless connectivity but they do charge $12.95 a day to use it. The restaurant on the second floor (Maxwell's) was very good. There is a bar on the 28th floor. The staff at the hotel are very quick to answer any questions and the hotel is pretty centrally located. It seemed a little overpriced but it's downtown to that is to be expected. Overall, I would recommend (I wouldn't tell anyone not to go there).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115428647">We bid on priceline for 115 and this is what we got. I cannot say enough about our Seattle trip, we had a great time and the Ren. Hotel was no exception. There was only one down side to this hotel and that is a 36 dollar parking fee per night. However, thanks to tripadvisor, I was anticipating the cost and budgeted accordingly. The hotel istelf is beautiful. We stayed on the 20th floor and had a great view of the city. The very friendly man who checked us in was very kind to give us a free upgrade at check-in when he learned it was our 10th anniversary trip. We did not expect this, and did not tell him that to get anything. It honestly came up causually in small talk and he quickly found us a lovely corner room suite. The room was clean and comfortable, appointed nicely and updated with a sleek modern feel. The bed was high quaility matress (a little on the firm side) but comfortable. The linens were good too. The pool and excersize rooms were great with wonderful views of the city. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We fell in love with Seattle and the hotel really helped! This hotel is located within walking distance of Pike Place and 5th ave. A short drive or long walk to the Space Needle. Easy access to Hwy 5.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115406335">Not the Renaissance I expected. First, the concierge was worthless. one morning I simply asked for a pack of matches.... simply hotel request, right? I was "educated" by this guy that the hotel was a smoke free property and that the hotel did not provide any matches. Keep in mind the hotel gift shop sells cigarettes and there are two smoking areas on the property. Good thing I didn't ask for anything important like a taxi or dinner reservations! I mentioned it to the front desk and ..... guess what...... more grief! More explanation, more defensiveness. So much for customer service from the renaissance. Second, the property is directly located on I-5, sixteens lanes of bustling traffic right in front of the hotel. How much relaxation do you think you're gonna get on your vacation or during your business trip? Third, the Renaissance is an old structure. Recent renovations are obvious.... a little too obvious. They really cut corners to save a dime, where hinged doors once were, cheap sliding doors now cover the bathrooms-problem is there are large gaps.... you really want a bathroom door to close, completely.... right? There are still signs of the old building: smelly old carpet, formica counter-tops. There are many wonderful hotels in Seattle, this is not one of them.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115102969">We got off our ship &amp; were at the hotel about 9am. We thought we would have the hotel hold our bags until check in time. We went to the front desk to let them know we would be back &amp; they went ahead a gave us our room right then. Very nice...very unexpected. The staff at the front desk were wonderful! We used the concierge several times during our stay, they were very friendly &amp; very helpful. The room had a fabulous view. We had a king size bed. I think it was one of the most comfortable hotel beds we've ever had. We would definately book this hotel again. The only draw back was that it was at the top of the hill on the outskirts of the downtown area. Seattle does have the "free bus" area, which included this hotel, so we were able to use that very easily. We did walk down the steep hill once but took the bus back up. Unless you are fit you would want to take the bus or a taxi.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114022568">I stayed here during the U2 concert tour (at Quest) for one night. Friendly desk help but other issues: Don't get a room facing I-5...the windows do not adequately shut out the noise (I was on the 15th fl). Bedding was fine. The workout room was gross....dusty / caked air ducts and wall outlets, missing lighting...looks like it had never been throughly cleaned (which is too bad since there's a decent amount of upper body equipment and incredible views from the room). Garage was completely full, but luckily there's a parking lot just across I-5.

Fitness facility was tiny and not suited for a real workout. Great location right across from the amazing Seattle Library and near all the downtown sights. One big problem: the water was scalding. It was impossible to get cold water! Better than the opposite problem but still strange. Aveda toiletries was a nice touch.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR111033174">I stayed for 2 nights in May while attending a conference. The room was clean and smelled fresh when I entered...this is GOOD and I what I expect every time but don't always get at all hotels. I was on a fairly high floor (16th) and had a view of both the freeway and a "sliver" of a water view. When I visited the bar on the 28th floor that had a nice view which included the Space Needle. I found the staff friendly and helpful. I ate only one meal at the hotel, breakfast, and it was adequate, wouldn't go there if I had time to go outside...Seattle has so many good restaurants that it's easy to be a food snob here. Worked out in the hotel gym...it was small, got a little crowded. On the other hand it was clean, had plenty of clean towels and all the patrons were polite to one another I will stay again because I do business with a company that uses this property...but would not rush to come back on my own. It's an adequate hotel, nice staff...but really nothing unique or special.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR110746386">My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance using priceline's "name your own price" and were rewarded with a room for $109.

Booked a double room with 2 beds. On arrival we were told all the two bed - rooms were sold out (due to a anime convention in Seattle I would guess) so they offered to upgrade us to a junior suite (Corner King Guest Room) with a king bed and we had no problem with that. Us girls don't mind sharing a big bed. The room was spacious, cozy and clean - no complaints there. Room was on 11th floor. Some traffic noise yes, but we slept like babies because we were tired from all the shopping and walking around. Loved the bed! The breakfast buffet was good. Ok selection of warm and cold breakfast foods. On second morning (Sun) there was an omelette bar, but we didn't try it. If you go to breakfast around 10am you might have to wait for a table for a bit. We got a table right away on both mornings there, but on the second morning we got the last available table, so the people who came after us, had to wait for one, but it didn't take long. The service at the Renaissance was brilliant. The maid slipped a card under the door on our first morning when we had the "little privacy please" sign on the door, asking us to inform her when we would like to have our room serviced. We saw her when we left for breakfast and asked her when she might have time to do our room. She offered to do it right away, while we were out having breakfast, even though she was in the middle of cleaning the room next door. The person who gets top marks from us is Richard, who greeted us at the front desk when checking in and out. We absolutely adored him. He was always so friendly and helpful towards us - he e.g. helped us change our bus reservation to an earlier departure time on Sunday morning, when we were leaving back to Vancouver. Such a lovely guy!! The location of the hotel was ok in our mind. You had to walk a bit though to get to Pike Place Market for example, but if you don't mind walking it's a good location (about 5 blocks from Pike St.). BUT note that the hotel is located on a massive(!!) hill so if you're in a crappy shape (like I am ;D) you will have a hard time climbing that loooong steep hill back to the hotel after a days shopping and walking around downtown. Just bear that in mind :D But all in all we had a really lovely stay and we would definitely go back to Renaissance hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR108106392">Stayed at this hotel during our family vacation to Seattle/Vancouver area for 2 nights. Overall the hotel is not bad consider the fact that we got a good deal to stay there for 2 nights during our trip. The hotel is nice and spacious, the room was spacious as well, clean and the beds were very soft and comfy. We ate out at the upstairs restaurant for dinner the second night, the food was not so bad but could've been much better. The service was supar and there was nobody to greet us for few minutes. I would expect better service for this type quality hotel or restaurant. I can see why the place looked empty. If you are here for a family trip, this place is somewhat close to the shopping and restaurants area nearby. However, it is not the most convenient place to stay due to the uphill climb if you are out of shape. My kids were complaining due to the walking and the shops/restaurants is a good 10 minutes away which is not so bad. I would stay at the Red Lion hotel which was our second leg of the trip, a much better location, when you step out of Red Lion, you will be with the crowd and all the coffee shops and stores and the mall too. Overall, I would rate this a 3 star, would probably not stay here next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108004603">It's not often I stay at a hotel and don't have some suggestion on how they can improve. The Renaissance Hotel in Seattle was seamless. Great staff, great food, enough lifts, well equipped room, comfortable beds.

They took great care of our delegation - I'd definitely stay again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR101912941">My husband and I love weekend trips and decided to go for luxury this time. I wasn't impressed at all. First, they hit you with a $30/night parking fee and explain if you don't like it, just move your car to the street. The rooms were just large bedrooms. Nothing of elegance at all. There was nothing really wrong, I just didn't think it was special.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR100220085">We are frequent visitors to Seattle. Once or twice per month I take my teenage daughter for shopping and mother-daughter quality time together. This time, I booked our hotel through Hotwire for $88 (including fees and taxes $108). It was described as 4 star hotel close to Pike Place and shopping. It was not as close to Pike Place as stated on the website but about 10-15 mins walking distance. I believe everything in Seattle downtown is walking distance. Luckily, we do not mind walking. Conveniently located on Madison st and 6th Ave, and right off of the freeway so we should not navigate through the downtown traffic. We stayed at this hotel one Saturday night. The check-in was fast and receptionist was very friendly. The lobby was spacious, modern and nicely decorated. We got a room on the 16th floor with freeway and city view. The room was spacious, as well, with two comfortable double beds, nice modern decorations and was very clean. Amenities included mini-fridge, flat screen TV, desk with Internet connection for a daily rate of $13 and complimentary coffee-tea station. I tried both caf and decaf coffee â€“ very good roasted coffee. I really liked the idea of one-time use coffee holders. It was very neat. With 5 or 6 types of different sweeteners, I was a little bit disappointed to not find just regular brown sugar. Good coffee deserves something better than sweetener. The restroom was also modern and clean. Shampoo/soap/conditioner were of decent quality. The only thing lacking were the shower caps. I am in love with swimming, so immediately I went to check on their swimming pool. The pool, whirlpool and fitness center are located on 28th floor. The fitness center has cardiovascular equipment, weights, and treadmills, and was mostly deserted. The pool to my disappointment was not deep enough. Max depth was 48â€� or so. One can walk but not swim. The whirlpool was full, so I did not try either of them. We didn't try any of the hotelâ€™s lounges or restaurants, so I cannot quote on their bar or restaurants. I found only 2 downsides of this hotel: 1. Parking. $30 for self-parking (with taxes $36) per night. Parking is narrow and has limited spaces, I found one empty spot almost at the very end. Parking in Seattle on the weekends is free starting Saturday after 6pm. I saw a couple of free parking spots right under my window. So it really is possible to find free parking close to this hotel (if you are staying on the weekend, of course). 2. Thin walls. We had a very noisy couple and I was embarrassed to hear it in front of my daughter. In general we enjoyed our short stay in this hotel and definitely will stay again.

It is a nice hotel, with a nice upper floor restaurant and lounge. The food was delicious, I believe a little over priced for such small portions. The room itself is nice enough. We self parked in the garage of the hotel. It cost $30 per night. We could have had the valet park for the same cost. I do not think the room or the hotel is nice enough to pay $60 in parking. I realize this is the going rate, but the hotel should maybe have specials with parking included for guests fo the hotel. We will not be staying her any time soon<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR99948075">This hotel was very elegantly designed. It is definitely more upscale than many in its price range. The 28th floor restaurant/bar was lovely and surprisingly quiet, meaning that it was easy to have a conversation. There is a small but sufficient pool and hot tub also on the 28th floor, as well as a decent sized fitness room. The room was actually more of a suite- small living room with desk/couch, then tiny "hallway" with bathroom (good counter space) and lovely bedroom with large corner windows. Although the rooms were tiny, they were more than sufficient for a single business traveler. Everything was BEAUTIFULLY decorated and finished, and very clean and well-kept. The only downside to the bedroom was the HORRIBLE and CONSTANT freeway noise (even from the 9th floor!). The breakfast buffet (for a charge) in the restaurant was decent. The French toast was WONDERFUL! The one downside was the horrible parking garage! It was very difficult to find a spot, and even more difficult to find a working elevator from the garage to the lobby. We ended up walking up 4 flights of stairs just to get to the lobby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR99434986">Found a great package here that included free parking or free breakfast. We took the first as parking in these hotels can be pretty spendy and there are plenty of breakfast places around. Got ourselves a small room with a king sized bed up on the 15th floor. I don't like noise so they found me a nice little spot even away from the street. Fairly quiet except for sirens periodically despite that. Other issues no free wifi, and in this day and age it feels like you are being slighted. They also had one of those 1 coffee cup machines in your room with, only 1 coffee filter.. so one of us had coffee in the morning anyway. Very clean and the decor fairly updated. The lobby is absolutely huge and beautiful. There are 3 restaurants (one is cafe) in the building which is also convenient. The food presentation was wonderful and the crabcakes were chock full of crab! The building goes up to the 28th floor and the view (also name of the lounge) is truly spectacular. The gym is also located on the 28th floor so you get a nice view while you are working out and lots of new machines as well as a swimming pool and a hot tub. That night of the wedding though they were packed in the swimming and hot tub area. All in all a decent place though we did run into a snafu in that they had a large wedding party that affected the parking and so when we got back from our evening we could not park actually for "free" in their garage. We ended up having to find a spot on the street instead.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR97459989">Unless the hotel is a true world wide 5 star i do not give more than 4 stars for the review.

On whole the stay was super. The staff treated me with class. Every interaction was professional. I am in a wheelchair so dealing with the hill meant using cabs. BTW Seattle finally has accessible taxis, for most of the time I lived in Seattle there weren't any and you to rely on Metro. The food at the hotel was superb, I had a marvelous burger and the clam chowder was super. I was served by room service and the staff was gracious at all times. The Laundry svc was great as they did a short notice pair slacks in and back in four hours! A note on the accessible rooms. I stayed in a dbl queen and king and they both were a bit narrow between the desk and front of the bed. The bathrooms were large but lacked sufficient grab bars at the tub and toilet. Made transferring very difficult and unsafe. In addition I would upgrade the bath seats to sturdier models. I would return as I loved the beds they were an oaisis! I will stay again overall a great time. Loved the art in the lobby bar and the great photos in the rooms.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR95782996">I went through Priceline, name your own price. It selected this hotel. The price was fair at best. The hotel charges $30.00 per night for self parking, $13. Per day for internet per computer. I did opt for a $20.00 per night upgrade once I checked in "for a better room/view". The view was OK, nothing great. After all the fee's, parking, etc. I could have stayed at a nicer hotel that was closer to the attractions I wanted to see. The staff, not including the front desk was very nice and accommodating. The front desk staff was just doing their job, no emotions and did not really did not care if I was satisfied or not. To sum this up, be careful on Priceline and the downtown area. Priceline rated this hotel as 4 stars, it is not 4 stars maybe 2.5 at best. Its old and needs to be updated. Prior to arriving in Seattle we were in Vancouver BC and stay at a Coast Hotel property (Coal Coast Harbor" and it was an excellent hotel and excellent staff.

The Renaissance is on the edge of the downtown area - the uphill edge. While most things are within walking distance, the sharp uphill stretch on the return to the hotel is surprisingly unpleasant! The hotel itself is largely unremarkable. The public areas are clean but unmemorable; the staff are helpful but not particularly friendly; the rooms and bathrooms contain what you'd expect but nothing stands out as being of a high standard. The rooms were spacious. I had a room on a high floor and was hoping for good views; sadly they were marred by the very dirty windows, one of which was also suffering from condensation in the inner panes of the double-glazing where the seal had obviously failed. Breakfast wasn't bad, but I'd expected better.

We were traveling from Victoria, BC, through the Amtrak train service so we were pretty tired by the time we got their. We booked a great deal with them through Hotwire,com earlier that day, and was hassle free at check in. They put us in a room facing the water with a very comfortable King size bed. The modernity of the hotel lobby continued throughout all the rooms and floors, especially the top floor with the "R-View" restaurant, fitness centre, and pool, the salt water touch was very nice as well. The location was exactly where we wanted to be..about a $5 cab ride to the nightlife, but out of the busy streets when going to sleep. The hotel also offered a refreshing &amp; inviting lobby where you wanted to sit, relax, and have a few drinks. Their was also a restaurant on the 2nd floor called Maxwell's that we discovered on the last morning of our stay where we enjoyed a delicious buffet breakfast for $16.75/each that included eggs,bacon,sausages,hashbrowns,fresh fruits,waffles, yogurt and all your morning beverages you could desire. We did however experience a slight downfall on the first night where a used bandaid was on the floor beside the bed, the chambermaids removed it immediately the next morning for us thankfully. Besides that we trusted the many other reviews that we read before we left and are very happy with the results! I highly recommend the Renaissance, the staff will go out of the way to help you with anything you need!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR93081995">We booked our one night stay on Priceline after winning a bid for $75.00 for the night. Priceline says this hotel is a 4 star property, but it is not in my opinion. I would put it at a 3 or possily 3.5 star. Here is why... The room furniture was scratched and had gouges in the surface. The tiles in the shower were cracked. There were scuff marks on painted surfaces. To me 4 star is attention to those details. So the room itself was more like a 3. The service was a little better. When we arrived I had mentioned we were there for my wife's birthday, and they asked me if we liked Wine or Beer. I said I liked Beer but my wife doesn't drink. When we returned from dinner they had placed two bottles of beer and a bottle of sparkling cider on ice in the room. Very cool. That service bumped me up to probably a 3.5 overall. The pool and hot tub were nice we spent a couple of hours there. Didn't try any of their lounges or restaurants. As far as noise goes, I do have to say you can hear things pretty easily. Heard a vaccum running in the morning, toilets flushing, heavy doors shutting, hotel itself creeking in the wind, and occasionally voices. Have to say the residants in the condos across the way are very entertaining and some even seem to enjoy putting on a show if you know what I mean. The parking underneath is tight. Hard to navigate and didn't appear to be enough. We came back around midnight or so and had to go all the way down. Overall, I can't complain for the price we paid. I'd stay again for that rate, but wouldn't pay full fare to stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR92691626">What a great trip, I am late writing this review. My wife and I stayed at the hotel on January 1&amp;2 checked out on the third.

We spent a bit of time in the Lounge on the top floor of the Hotel, what a view! Service was fine and the wine was nice. On Saturday night we made a reservation through the concierge with "Purple" what a great evening, I would recommend this restaurant and a flight of wine. Knowledgeable staff and great service.

We had the opportunity to spend several nights at the Renassiance Madison hotel when business required us to be in the area. The hotel is on Madison on a hill. We took the Grayline Downtown Airporter bus into Seattle and this one of it's first stops. This was my first stay at this property. I have stayed three times at the Marriott Waterfront and one time at the Grand Hyatt on Pine within the past few years. Check-in was bit slow because the front desk staff was unsure I could use a coupon that Marriott at sent to me. It's a bit odd that Marriott Corp. and Individual Property Owners are not the same page with promotional discounts. After conferring with the GM, I was allowed to use the discount. Our room was facing Elliott Bay on a higher floor so there was not ground and/or freeway traffic to hear. The rate was reasonable for Seattle plus I used a Marriott promotional coupon. Our was very comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed was ultra comfortable. Both feather and foam pillows were available. Lighting in the room was very good with lamps on both sides of the bed, on the desk, and a floor lamp. There are adjustable LED reading lamps on the bed which would be great if you were traveling with someone who wanted to sleep as you read. The work desk was large and the office-style chair functional and comfortable. My The room had a sofa and a comfortable arm chair. Since my last stay, new LCD flat screen TVâ€™s have been added. The TV was had a lot of cable channels as well as a wide selection of pay-per-view movies. I looked at some previews and costs per movie seemed to be between $12 and $15. The bathroom was also recently refurbished.. Lighting was good, the towels were plentiful, and the shower worked well â€“ immediate hot water with plenty of pressure. Bath amenities include shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and mouthwash. The concierge lounge located on one of the top fllors Like guest rooms it has been recently refurbished. The hotel public areas were clean and well-kept, but could use an updating to the style of the rooms. The hotel has a large indoor swimming pool and hydrotherapy spa. Sliding doors open onto a patio with additional lounge chairs. Next to, and with windows looking onto the pool, is a very complete exercise room. All of the exercise equipment seemed nearly new. There is also a sauna and steam room accessible from the pool area. This property is located on a steep hill but the trick is to walk towards Pine street where the incline is gradual. If you take this route, then walking to the Waterfront and/or Pike's Public Market is not too bad. If you need to visit the local government offices and Federal courthouse, then this location is plus. It is also near the public library and is near the older Pioneer Square businesses and allows you visit another neighborhood of Seattle different from either the Public Market and/or Belltown. There is University of Washington store nearby too. Seattle is increasing becoming more visited due to all of Alaskan Cruise lines which prior to 9/11 disembarked from Vancouver, B.C. So sometimes property rates can be really high in this city. For a good rate, we will stay here again when visiting the Emerald City.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR90587610">Booked a single king room for a Saturday night via Priceline for $110. Would have prefered a location closer to the shopping district and Pike Place, but it was fine for us as we don't mind walking. Room was clean and modern with standard amenities including mini-fridge filled with 2 complimentary bottles of water. Free wireless in common areas but not in rooms. We requested a room on a higher floor away from the highway but was only able to secure a room on the 22nd floor on the highway side. Luckily, we didn't notice the highway traffic at all while sleeping. However, we did find the air conditioner/heater to be quite noisy as it would turn on and off periodically throughout the night. The $30 non valet parking does give you in and out privileges, but the parkade beneath the hotel is difficult to navigate. Upon returning to the hotel at 1030 or 11pm, we drove all the way to the bottom of the parkade but could not find an empty spot - even in the restricted area reserved for valet parking! Luckily, on our way out of the parkade, we found one empty stall at the parkade entrance that was previously filled. We weren't upset, but we did find it odd that such a huge hotel had such limited parking available for guests. When we mentioned our parking incident at check-out the next morning, the concierge explained that there had been a wedding at the hotel the previous night and that, had we not been able to find a parking spot, we could have driven the car back up to the hotel entrance and the valet could have secured a spot for us on the street. He also mentioned that parking is free in downtown Seattle on Saturdays after 6pm and all day Sunday, so we actually could have found street parking ourselves for our one night stay! We enjoyed our stay at this hotel but nothing in particular stood out to us as amazing. It's listed as a 4 star on many websites as it offers many amenities (none of which we utilized), but it feels more like a 3.5 star. I would stay here again but only at a discounted rate.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR90385826">We were lodged at the Renaissance through a bid on Priceline and reside locally in Seattle. We were assigned a room with an adjoining door to the next room--we assumed no one was in that room. Wrong! We could hear everything that was happening 'next' door--in this case there was a young excited child -- making sleep difficult (at best) and taking away any chance of a restful stay for us. The room needed a boost in temperature so we turned on the heater/AC system--we felt like we were on the runway of a major airport---extremely LOUD in room heater--not 4 star quality!!! The staff do as best they can, but one has to wonder what management is thinking when they cluster people in rooms that make sleeping impossible-in a hotel that was no where near capacity. The remodeling and updating appears to all be superficial, as the experience was less than satisfactory. I spoke to the front desk, and they felt that when the neighbor checked out--everything would be fine. True, except why were we assigned a room like this to begin with? This is the first time I've felt like a second class citizen at a hotel--and it happened in Seattle at the Renaissance.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR90346917">I would certainly go back to this hotel. All things considered, the hotel is adequate too nice. We only stayed one night, and spent most of our time out and about. We did not eat at the hotel at all. You have an entire city at your doorstep. Pros: - Downtown, walking distance from almost everything worth seeing downtown. - Affordable, I didn't think the price was unreasonable. - $140 for one night including parking for almost 2 days - Nice little bar on top floor for late night cocktails. - Staff are human, meaning honestly friendly without being fake. - Excellent king size bed. - Perfectly clean, everywhere. - Nice TV, with enough free channels to just chill out for a while. - We called for toothpaste, and they were there in less than a minute. - Check-in/out in less than 5 minutes, even with airline pilots arriving and going all the time. - Don't expect a new 5 star hotel. This is more like a slightly older, but very well decorated and managed 4 star. Cons: - The room air-con kept me awake until I finally decided to just turn it off. - Flushing next door can be heard clearly at night, since the walls are not concrete. - If you want to be fussy, you could complain about being close to the highway, with some rooms not having much of a view, and some noise. For us, it wasn't all that big of an issue. The air-con was noisier anyway.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR90305399">My wife and I took an overnight trip to Seattle to enjoy the holiday season and have a break from the kids while visiting grandma's house. The Renaissance Seattle Hotel made great trip, a outstanding trip! The room was 5-star quality; we slept on a comfy king size bed and woke up to a beautiful morning overlooking the city of Seattle from the 24th floor! The restuarant was a great choice for breakfast with a overly friendly staff and a great breakfast at very competitive prices! The whole hotel staff would go out of their way to serve us and ensure our stay was the best possible! I can't say enough good things about our stay and the great things about the hotel. We will definitely be back for a night's stay or even just to have a meal! Only negative comment: I-5 could cause a problems if you are a light sleeper... if so ask for the other side of the hotel. This didn't bother us, but we are heavy sleepers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR90191252">My car was parked on the Renaissance hotel underground parking in Saturday, December 11th. It cost you $20 to park your car for more than 4 hours. When I return back from the event that was hold in this hotel, I found that somebody broke in to my car and all my electronincs (GPS, iPhod, Radar detector and my cell phone) were stolen. The hotel security was a zero help - they don't have cameras on the undeground parking. The $20 you pay for the parking doesn't give you any protection. The hotel management made it clear that they are not responsible for anything that would happen to your car. Basically you are on your own.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR88493816">Seattle Renaissance Hotel We booked this room via Travelocity for a great price, it included parking and a free upgrade to a Suite. Check-in...The staff member was nice and professional. We asked for a high floor on the cityside of the building and were given both request. Hotel Room...We were in a two room suite, small living room area and a small bedroom but perfect for what we wanted. The room have multiple views from the window and there was limited street noise in our room. The room was clean and stocked well with linens, towels and hotel information. There were two tvs, one in the living room, guessing about a 37 inch and one in the bedroom again guessing 32 inch. The tvs were LG brand and both were a little fuzzy. The bed was semi-comfortable and the sheets were a little rough as were the towels. The bedroom had a nice window seat. The bathroom was on the smaller side but worked well, the lighted mirror is a nice touch. The bathroom door is a joke, guessing that due to the small size of the bathroom having a door open into the bathroom wouldnâ€™t work well and having one open into the narrow hallway also wouldnâ€™t work well. The bathroom was also missing a proper towel rack. The closet space in the hallway was good and there was a safe in the closet. There was also a small fridge and shelf area next to the closet. Hotel...The hotel was nice, clean and the elevators were very fast. The bar and lobby area were nice. The gift shop was well stocked and had moderate prices. The parking garage under the hotel is a little tight and many of the parking spaces are also a bit tight. Hotel Staff...All staff members were great, we ordered delivery twice and asked the concierge for delivery advice and they were so helpful and even provided menus to different restaurants that deliver. The housekeeping staff were friendly and did a very good job cleaning the rooms, kudos to them. A coupleof issues...Two of the chanels on the TV were not working, we asked to be comped TV internet in return and the helpful employee did so, but the internet tv is not even worth the hassel when it is free. The bathroom door was off its track when we arrived at the hotel room. Maintenance was called and arrived quickly, but didnâ€™t properly fix the door. I ended up fixing the door after he left. We also decided the have the special Thanksgiving Buffet...to say the least it wasnâ€™t worth the price. The food was cold at times and they ran out of things like mashed potatoes quickly and you had to wait for them to refill the items. The selection was also not great. I also think having this buffet in the actual space of the R-view Restaurant on the 28th Floor would have been better instead of the 2nd Floor Maxwells location. The management should realize that Thanksgiving is special are for the price of the meal having a nice view would be a nice touch. Overall we would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR87713135">I recently stayed at this hotel as part of a conference with multiple non-profit organizations. The location of the hotel is ok, but do be aware that you will need to do a little walking to get to a plethora of restaurants. Within 6 blocks or so, one can be in the midst of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel itself is ok but I'm not sure I would call it a 4 star hotel but perhaps more of a 3.5 star. As a meeting planner, my reviews are based on more than the hotel room itself and take the meeting space and hotel amenities into consideration. At check-in, I was placed on the Club Level - 26th floor. My room was spacious with a king bed and two chairs. The view from my room included city sights as well as the freeway and in the distance on a clear day, one can see the snow capped mountains. Amenities: The hotel offers a decent sized fitness center on the 28th floor along with an indoor pool and hot tub. The hotel also offers a Business Center on the lower level of the hotel, however, it is costly to use ($1.20 per page printed black ink only) and while I was there, the equipment consistently was out of order. Meeting Space: I was not impressed by the meeting space. I felt it was older and needed renovations and is far too spread out over 5 floors. The first three levels on which the meeting space is located are connected by escalators but the additional 2 floors require use of the stairs or elevator. The rooms themselves are standard rooms though some have windows with a view. Food: The hotel offers one restaurant, one restaurant/bar, one coffee shop/bar and in-room dining. Food prices are consistent with most other hotels. Catering for events was perfectly fine and I was happy the hotel was willing to meet the diverse dietary needs of my group (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-intolerant, etc.). Room service was prompt and hot (unlike many hotels I have visited). Overall, I would recommend this hotel to others though I am not sure I would host an event here again due to the layout of the meeting space. My main complaint about the hotel is the elevators. While I understand that my meeting included over 600 attendees, I was on the 26th floor and consistently had to wait for quite a while for an elevator to get to various floors. Though this hotel has 5 elevators, an addition of two more elevators would be ideal as they move fairly slowly and seem to not respond as quickly as in other properties in which I have stayed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR87178962">Overall, this hotel was pretty good. We stayed here for 4 nights and had very little interaction with the staff. Our room was small but nicely decorated. On our first night, we went to the bar on the 28th floor, where they had a great happy hour special and nice views of downtown Seattle. The location is okay. We walked to Pike Market every day, and were able to walk to other downtown areas (Captiol Hill, Pioneer Square, the ferry terminal) as well. It is up a hill but it's an invigorating walk. If you don't feel up to it, it's easy to hail a cab around the city. The walls were kind of thin. There was a really loud woman in the room next to ours. I had to knock on her door and ask her to quiet down b/c her loud talking was waking me up at 6 am every day. I could also hear our neighbors' alarm clocks. In this day and age, I find it offensive that any hotel would still charge for WiFi. With this hotel, it was worse because they also charge for use of their computers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR87103547">We recently stayed at this hotel for 1 night. The room and bathroom was very clean and nicely furnished. The connoisseur was very helpful and gave us many suggestions for good places to eat.

We were actually SHOWN around the lobby/elevators by the front desk staff. The valet got a cab for us with a huge smile. Our servers both for dinner and in the morning couldn't do enough for us. We were stunned. The bed had a goose down comforter that I seriously wanted to steal. I've NEVER taken a thing from a hotel, but if I could have taken that bed and those pillows in my suitcase , I would have. Water pressure was fantastic-the shower was terrific Lots of elevators and escalators. We never had to wait. THE NOT SO GREATS Be to be sure and get a higher floor--we were on the 12th floor, and could still hear traffic noise from the nearby freeway. There isn't much within walking distance as far as food, but the restaurant is pretty good. Have the Prix Fix menu of the salad and the salmon for $28. Best salmon I've had in years. Taxis are sitting in front of the hotel, there isn't a shuttle. Has teeny water pot and enough coffee for 2 cups or enough tea for 2 cups. That was a cheap little surprise in the coffee center of the universe-Seattle. NO microwave AMENITIES Room service was available Aveno complimentary products Ironing Board/Iron in room Blow Dryer in Room Extra blanket available in the closet Fridge in the room Small store on lower level-open until 10pm Pool and Spa Nicely equipped work out room, although busy I priceline'd this hotel for $73, if that helps. I would have easily paid double...and not been upset about it at all. We will return.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR86689722">I purchased this hotel on priceline and was discouraged when I looked at website, did not seem appealing. I couldn't have been more wrong....the hotel is beautiful and the staff is awesome, very polite and helpful in every way. It is definitely on a hill but only a few blocks from Pikes Market and I guess there is a free bus that you can catch for a return trip. The only drawback is if you don't bring your computer, they have a business room but you pay for computer use by the minute..... We would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR83217494">The Renaissance Hotel is situated very centrally right off the I-5. Shopping can be walking distance at the Westlake Centre downtown. Great free parking on the weekends on the street. The hotel itself is quite old, but the lobby has been redone and looking modern and nice. The room is clean and the washroom has been redone and very clean. Our room faced the I-5 and was very noisy. We just turned the fan on to act as white noise so we can get some sleep, otherwise the highway noise can be quite disruptive. The exercise room and pool are on the top floor, with a nice view. The pool water was rather cool.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR83139921">I loved this hotel. It was convenient to Seattle attractions like Pike Place Market, the library, wine bars, and the Seattle Art Museum.

The hotel staff was very courteous in accommodating all of my requests. We had dinner at sunset at the hotel restaurant on the top floor.. it was gorgeous and I highly recommend it if you stay there.

Got a smokin deal and was takin back by how nice it was inside. Didn't pay $40 for the parking and parked on the street, beacause it was a long weekend we didn't have to plug parking meters. It was fairly close to all amenities of down town. Some crazy hills outside. I would recomend zig zagging up streets to avoid one constant hill climb. Would stay there again if was to get the same good deal. They had a beautiful fireplace down stairs where you could kick back and sip some cocktails. Food was a little over priced in the Hotel and would strongly recommend taking a two minute stroll around the block for restaurants.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR77170162">The first room I got from the front desk was one facing the highway and close to the elevator but on a high floor. I requested another room and then got a very nice city view facing the downtown area within minutes. At night, I could see the city light up and, during the day, I could see as far as Safeco Field and Qwest Field. During my stay, I had a small problem with not having cold water but it was promptly fixed. I also had the chance to go for a short swim on the pool on the top floor (28) of the hotel in the morning and I was offered beautiful views of the city. If I had more time, I would go back at night too. Overall, the hotel staff were warm and welcoming. The rooms were modern and newly renovated (halls were kinda a weird pink though, but I appreciate the bold color choice); housekeeping was very attentive. She brought me bottled water every day for tea and coffee and made sure I had enough toiletries and towels every day (yay Aveda!). I think I became spoiled...:) The location was in the middle of downtown Seattle, overlooking an interstate highway. However, one can walk over the highway via an overpass and it is not loud at all. I enjoyed this hotel's location very much; it was just a few blocks from Frye Art Museum, the Underground Tour, Smith Tower, and the Columbia Tower SkyView. The concierge directed me to these attractions and they did not disappoint. Just beware that the hotel is located on a hill. It may be challenging at the end of a long sightseeing day to climb back up. Seattle is very walkable. I took the downtown free ride zone buses (Bus 12); one of their last stops is at front of the hotel. After walking to Pine St. and 5 or 6 Ave., it is possible to take a monorail at Westlake Center to Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project). I also recommend the SkyView Observatory at Columbia Tower instead of the Space Needle. It is only $5 ($3 for students with ID) as compared to like $18 at the Needle. The view there is far more stunning and expansive, without the wires that cover the Space Needle's viewing deck. I've been to both and I can honestly say that the Space Needle is really all hype.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR76874307">Be sure to ask for a room on the West side of the hotel. The East side faces the highway and can be pretty noisy. The room was nice, clean and spacious enough. All dining and attractions were located at least several blocks away if not more, all downhill. That sounds great until you have to hike back up. The $30/night parking was steep, but this is a city. Next time I will stay closer in town to, believe it or not, avoid noise and be closer to the attractions.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR75183781">Lobby, staff, concierge, mattress are all great.

We paid $175 on priceline.com for a double room - same room goes for $240 on the hotel's website. We wouldn't have booked without getting a discounted rate. Biggest disappointment with this hotel was that they didn't offer a breakfast nor do they offer free internet/wi-fi access. Overnight parking costs $30, but you can go in and out with room key. The hotel was located at the North end of Downtown Seattle and not really in walking distance to main sites (unless you want to walk back up steep hills). We took cabs to the market and baseball game, but didn't pay over $10 on a cab ride and the trips didn't take more than 10 minutes. Hotel is right on I-5, but we didn't notice the traffic with the window closed and a/c on at night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72651928">This hotel is on a hill so if you plan to walk from the hotel to the many nearby attractions, be ready to work your quad muscles, because walking up the hill can be literally breathtaking:) I am exaggerating a bit, but it is a leg workout nonetheless. The lobby areas are nicely decorated in a modern design, there is a nice bar and lounge area with a big flat screen TV where I watched people eating dinner in front of. The 28th floor has a restaurant with beautiful city views and it also has a small fitness facility and salt water or saline pool (I can't remember which). It is a 15 min walk to the monorail which takes you to the Space Needle and lots of shopping and restaurants along the way. Also the hotel is just a hop, skip and jump to the modern public library. One drawback it that it is located next to a freeway, so if you're smog sensitive perhaps this is not the place for you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR72088960">We spent a few days touring Seattle before we boarded a ship for our Alaskan cruise. It was our first time in Seattle and we were very glad that we booked this particular hotel. We had a room on the 26th floor which was the concierge level. The room had been updated with lots of nice amenities and a great view of the city. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean (I'm a stickler for cleanliness!). The food in the Concierge Club was so-so, but the friendliness of the staff made up for what the food lacked. I had spoken with the hotel prior to our visit and asked them to book a Town Car to pick us up at the airport. The car arrived right on time, with a very pleasant driver, who handled our bags and delivered us to the front door of the hotel. Before we left for the cruise we wanted to ship home some items we had bought in the city. The front desk staff went out of their way to find us packaging supplies for our gifts and get them picked up by FedEx. Next time we go to Seattle we will be staying at this hotel for sure!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR71775056">I loved my stay at the Renaissance Hotel! From reading the reviews, it sounds like a renovation took place recently. The gym is awesome- 5 or 6 treadmills overlooking the city, ellipticals, weights, and other machines made it really nice!! The saltwater pool and hot tub also looked over the city. These were spectacular views from the 28th floor! The hotel staff was very friendly. We asked for a room with two beds, but they didn't have one, so they gave us a suite! They brought up a rollaway bed. Great view.. I recommend getting a room on a high floor. I had no noise issues! The bathroom was nice- they even have Aveda shampoo and conditioner. The location is great for shopping (about 5 blocks away) and going to Pike's Market (down some steep hills you'll have to eventually come up again, but closeby). The food is expensive if you get ro service, but everything was pretty good! The water pressure is low, but I figure that's because they are trying to conserve water.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR70494174">The corner suite on the 16th floor was beautiful. The problem was freeway noise that went on all night long. Even on the 16th floor with the air conditioner running, it could not be drowned out. I asked to be moved to the west side of the hotel which faces Puget Sound, but those rooms are saved for Marriott Gold and Platinum elite Rewards members. Unless, you are elite, stay elsewhere. If you are elite, then stay here. Fitness room is very nice and corner lounge on the top floor (28th) is beautiful.

The hotel location is perfect. It is within walking distance to just about everything we wanted to see/do while in Seattle. It does sit on the top of a very steep hill, so walking back up after a long day of sight-seeing is a bit of a trek. I would recommend grabbing a cab for the return trip (less than $5 from most places). The room was nice. Two comfortable double beds with multiple pillows, a desk, chair, refridgerator, and decent sized closet. The bathroom is niclely updated with pleanty of counter space and nice toiletries. We had a room with access to the concierge lounge, which provided free snacks, drinks, and continental breakfast items each day. Our room faced the highway, but I did not hear any noise (on the 27th floor). The parking was convienient. The garage is very small, with tight access around corners and into spots. I can't complain since the price was included in the room rate. We ate a full breakfast twice at Maxwells. The buffet was very good, with a selection of hot and cold items. On Sunday morning there was even someone doing made-to-order omlets. There is paid internet access in the rooms, but all common areas have free wi-fi. The first floor lounge has comfortable chairs and a fireplace and was a great place to do some quick internet surfing without paying.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR65400571">One of the first things that strikes you about this hotel is that there is no portico, or drive/drop area. Yeah, around the side there are two "3 minute drop" spots...but, realistically your chances of snagging one of these is limited, so you're pretty well forced to pull into the underground parking structure. The parking garage is "unique" in its layout and not user friendly. Getting your luggage/gear into the hotel involves going up several floors to the lobby, to register...then getting one of the bell staff to follow you back down to the vehicle with a cart. It works...and the staff are very eager to assist. Just a tad inconvenient for someone arriving with a vehicle. The location of this hotel is NOT very convenient for a tourist wanting to walk around the various downtown core areas...it's way too far away...Pikes Market is a long shlep...and almost entirely UPHILL on the return...my advice: walk down, taxi back...don't even think of driving into this area...parking is a nightmare. The rooms are clean, but of average quality...probably not really a four-star. The I-5 side of the hotel is REALLY noisy...so, insist on a room on the opposite side...and one that is at least above the 15th floor. Quite a few comments have been made about the bathroom door setup...the etched-glass sliding door is not the best solution...any thought of leaving the light on during the night (as a night light for those late-night visits) will provide way too much light for sleeping. Two interesting things: the toilet is a very, VERY low affair...almost like a squat-hole one would find in a third-world country...and the sink drain, although part of a very attractive facet is really well hidden for the technically challenged! A few blocks from the hotel are some good food choices: Brooklyn Seafood (ultra fresh, but a little steep on the pricing), a GREAT happy hour can be found a few blocks further at the Metropolitan Grill...probably the best in Seattle. If you want the real-deal Chinese experience try Sichaun Cuisine in the International area...the best double-baked almond croisant in Seattle: Bakery Nouveau...just yelp for details.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR65348182">Early arrival (7:30am) after a six hour plane ride. Greeted getting out of the cab and even before I reached the front desk the receptionist had a smile on her face. I greetly like they really expected me and said my room was available!! WOW. I had a great corner unit and got excited! Business travelers don't normally get such a deal. Room was clean, bed and pillows comfortable and didn't once have to adjust the thermostat!! Remained at a cool 68 for my entire week's stay. Attended a training class the entire week held at the hotel. Loved that it was kiddie corner to the public library.

I'd stay here again!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR62816768">The Good - Availability of good rates. But guess why the rates are so good...read on... The Bad - HIGHWAY NOISE. I stayed on the 10th floor of the hotel - room 1013, which unfortunately faced the highway. Wow, the highway noise was breathtakingly loud. With the constant roar of traffic and the grinding gears of semi trucks, I convinced myself several times over that a window was ajar, but nope, the closed windows simply had little to no noise insulation. This was true also of the walls between rooms; conversations from the next room over were clearly audible in our room. Earplugs are an absolute must. - Location. Right in the heart of Seattle's highway on-ramp district, this hotel was a significant hike from the attractions and neighborhoods that a tourist would be interested in visiting. This might not be true for business travelers. - Internet price. Ugh, $12.95 for wired internet every day? Please hotels, just build that cost into the hotel rate. - Sliding bathroom door. Probably not a problem for a solo traveler, but when sharing a room with someone else, it's annoying how the bathroom door is on a sliding rail rather than a traditional door hinge. It means the bathroom door doesn't close entirely. Instead, the door squeaks on its railing and doesn't provide the same privacy as a door in terms of sight or, sorry, smell. The bottom line - Even at such an inexpensive rate, the negatives associated with staying here clearly outweighed the positives. I'll definitely choose another hotel in Seattle next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR62327291">A good location for anyone who is trying to get a neutral walking friendly location. With the exception of the Space Needle you can walk to most attractions including Pike Place Market and the stadiums. We were treated exceptionally by the staff, which really made this property shine. We felt like it was five-star white-glove treatment, the rooms were more on par with the 4* rating and the room could have been cleaner (windows/bathroom were a bit dirty upon check-in) but we did get a corner king upgrade with a fantastic bedroom panoramic view of the city. Be careful of the â€œOn Demandâ€� Network TV Shows â€“ you will be charged without even seeing the price or a confirmation screen. Also, you can park on the street from 6pm to 8am for free and there is plenty of spots.

As the other reviews state, you do hear a lot of traffic noise, even on the west side. Barely a view of the water, since there are so many other tall buildings blocking the view. Very good appetizers for the $2 happy hour price. Room very clean, roomy. No bargains for us, since we reserved on hotwire... Others have mentioned free parking, free desserts, free breakfast, etc., but not with our budget reservations... I guess you pay one way or the other - parking was too expensive and we didn't get a break... We enjoyed it, anyway. Would choose a different hotel next time, though. No microwave, small shelves in small refrigerator - couldn't put our leftovers in it...

It was spacious and clean, with great views. The hotel has a great 28th floor restaurant/bar called the Visions Lounge which has a good happy hour and great views of the city. Another great thing about the hotel was the free gym and pool access. My biggest gripes with the Renaissance was it's expensive parking ($38/day), location, and expensive internet services ($12.95/day). It is adjacent to the I-5 and it can get a little loud. Also, it's a bit of a walk to downtown attractions like Pioneer Square, Pikes Place, and the mall. Coming back after a long day downtown can be difficult as the Renaissance is located atop a San Francisco-esque hill. Still, with all that, I think it was a good value. Large, clean, comfortable rooms with a nice lounge, and good concierge service.

For this reason alone, I would probably not stay there unless I could get a room on the western side of the hotel. I heard traffic at all hours of the night. (2) The concierge lounge is way too small for the number of business guests they have. We had very little space to sit down and eat. The concierge staff was very attentive. This is a nice hotel...but I need peace and quiet when I sleep.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR49009566">Stayed here for 3 nights and nothing stands out that was overwhelmingly negative or overwhelmingly positive. The location is good - but be warned, the walk to the waterfront is down a very very steep hill. The room was nice, very comfortable bed, also nice tv and sitting area, refrigerator, everything seemed new and well placed. The water pressure in the shower could be improved, but it was ok. Good service and nice views on the 28th.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR48723475">I got a deal of $70 per night through Priceline for this hotel. At that price it was a good deal. If I was paying the $170-200 I saw on their web site I would have been disappointed. The room is clean and had sitting chairs. Almost everything in the hotel only comes with extra $$. I big pet peeve for me is that they charge for internet access. In this day and age, wireless should be free at every hotel. The location is poor as it is right next to the freeway. Also, that area of DT Seattle on a weekend is pretty dead.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR48591942">I stay in Marriott properties (including Renaissance) on a regular basis and have tried them around the globe. This is one of the most disappointing properties I've stayed in. First off, the hotel is located over a highway which is somewhat of a convenience as the hotel is located very centrally within Seattle. My initial room, however, was over the highway and had surprisingly little sound insulation. I literally could not sleep due to the traffic noise - and I was on the 17th floor. When I requested a room change, they initially told me there were no available rooms. When I told them of my Marriott status - which they did not request when I checked in - a room suddenly materialized. Although this is a non-smoking property, I was overwhelmed with smoke from one of my neighbors on several occasions - bad luck on my part. The concierge lounge is the smallest I've seen and extremely crowded. I personally will try one of the other Marriott properties the next time I'm in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR47835097">Our trip to Seattle in late July/early August started with a 2 night stay at the Seattle Renaissance. The best part of this hotel was the location. It is such easy access to all the main sites of Seattle. We were able to easily walk to downtown, the piers, Pike's Place Market, and to the Monorail that took us to Seattle Center/Space Needle/Duck Tours. A rental car wouldn't have been necessary for the activities we did. The pool on the (?28th floor) was small, but offers a great view of the city. You can find an even better view of the city from the lounge/bar area. They offered a great happy hour with great tasting appetizers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR47279960">Clean rooms, great front desk staff.

We booked the rooms on Priceline and were very happy with the rate for a hotel chain that has a reputation of quality rooms and great service. We were please with the service that we received from the staff, although i am annoyed when guests are not allowed to use a luggage cart (a number of carts were parked near the front door) and must use the services of a bell hop. We have two strong sons that are more than capable of managing our luggage, but instead we are required to tip a bell hop. I also found the parking prices to be ridiculous, even for Seattle...$28 per day. We have never paid even close to this amount for parking at a hotel, even in San Francisco and New York City. Charging $13 per day for internet access was the last straw. Our room was very nice, with comfortable bedding and a convenient charging station for electronics. One small room complaint...the bathroom doors are sliders that have no latch or lock.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR42169451">Came here for a conference, but wifey came with for leisure. This was our first time in that far west, much less Seattle, so we didn't know what to expect. We arrived and the hotel was nice!!! Check-in is was pleasant and smooth...and we even received wine and fruit in our room. (had the family/friends starwood elite treatment) Our room was on the 15th floor or something, it was for the preferred guests. And they know how to treat preferred guests!!! The preferred guest lounge was top shelf with free food and a free happy hour on certain days. I even met the manager of guest services at the happy hour reception who was very nice and hospitable. (forgot her name, but she was Black) My wife and I were so impressed with the preferred guest treatment, we felt like a king and queen. It was unfortunate though, that EVERY customer doesn't that same type of treatment. (people on the first 8 floors---the non-preferred "regular" guests) The stratification made us kinda sad, to see that certain guests were treated better than others. It was nice, but we wished everyone could have experienced what we did. We also ate in the restaurant lounge at the top of the hotel. (can't remember the name) But it was super top shelf with an AMAZING VIEW!!! Quite serene...Seattle has a great skyline. Although kinda small, the fitness center was modern and nice. The pool was nice too and had a chic feel to it. We even received free breakfast coupons, and the breakfast was superb. The service was a little shaky though, as they may have been understaffed. Great food though. Great location downtown; close enough to walk everywhere, but not too far from everything downtown. Overall this hotel really impressed us and gave us a really good percpetion and experience of Seattle. Everyone was so nice and professional. Please stay here!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37835274">I picked this 3.5 star hotel for location (Pike Place market) and style, although it turned out to be right over the freeway and not really where I would consider the Pike Place area. There was great (free) public transportation just a few steps a way so that was not a problem. The hotel staff was cold: check-in was efficient but indifferent; concierge was so full of himself that he did not even make eye contact or smile while he was on the phone. I finally walked away. After we unpacked, left and then returned from our day, we found the toilet did not work. They had no part on hand (for a toilet??) and the maintenance man told us we would have to pack up and move. The desk was unapologetic and sent us to another room, which turned out to be a corner room and extremely small. After 5 pleasant days about town, we would have taken this all in stride -- until the ultimate blow. My favorite, and one of a kind, jacket was left hanging in the closet when we departed to stay with a relative and when we called to retrieve it, it had not been turned in. We called for several days: the lost and found, then the hskp supervisor, then the GM, but they could not or did not attempt to retrieve it from the dishonest staff member/thief. The GM (had a french accent) even said "I will take this personally." We never heard from him. STAY AWAY. There are much better choices for hospitality and locations in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37626647">We recently traveled to Seattle for a short vacation and stayed at the Renaissance. I was somewhat underwhelmed. The location is pretty good; not great. It's at the top of a large, steep hill, so if you're planning on walking around Seattle, be ready to make the the climb more than once (this is coming from a person who's in pretty good shape). It is walking distance to the ferries, shopping, museums, and the Pike market, but it isn't a short walk. It is also RIGHT NEXT to the freeway, so if freeway noise bothers you at night, then this isn't the place to stay. Our room was clean and fairly comfortable, although our reservation was messed up and we ended up changing rooms to accommodate our needs, which were communicated in our original reservation. The Internet service was $13 a day, which seemed a little high. The soap / shampoo in the room was horrible. This sounds like a small thing, but we travel frequently and I try to limit what I bring, so I've started depending on whatever is provided. Normally this isn't a problem from a 4-star hotel, but this time I felt like I was showering at the Motel 6 with the no-name soap and shampoo that smelled like cheap cologne. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and the service very friendly. However, we had our 20-year-old son with us and when we sat down to order a drink near the bar one evening, they ordered us out of the area because he wasn't 21. I can understand this since Washington has a strict law, but the area was large and not easily defined as being the "the bar", we weren't familiar with the law, and they were a bit loud about the whole thing which was embarrassing to our son. Overall, I wish we had stayed somewhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37356236">We arrived at the hotel after a long flight from Boston with our 1 year old. The moment we stepped onto the property, the staff helped us feel welcome. They checked us in early (around 1:30) and gave us a room on the Puget Sound side. A few hours later, we noticed our fridge wasn't working properly, and they arrived with a replacement within 10 minutes to make sure our daughter's milk was kept cold. We enjoyed the pool on the top floor (terrific view!), though were disappointed that the hot tub was not working at all during our stay. Because of the time change, we were up bright and early with our daughter (sadly, around 3:30am the first few mornings.) My husband and I would switch off taking her down to explore the lobby while the other one slept. The lobby was quiet at that time except for the cleaning staff, who were extremely friendly and tolerant of our daughter running around. The best part about this hotel is its location. It's very convenient to the highway, so easy to get to, plus its a short walk from Pike Place, Westlake Center (monorail to Seattle Center) and lots of restaurants and grocery stores. We almost stayed at the waterfront Marriott but ended up getting a much better deal at the Renaissance, and I was glad we ended up where we did. Traffic down near the water would have been a nightmare. All in all, we were very impressed with this hotel and would highly recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR36804360">I spent one night at the Renaissance Seattle in August 2009 while traveling on business. I arrived very late on a cross-country flight, and it was a welcome relief to be greeted warmly by the friendly front desk staff when I finally arrived. Check-in took no more than five minutes and I had no problem finding the elevators and getting up to my room. When I requested a late check-out, the front desk staff was very gracious and was able to accommodate me. My room was large and clean. In addition to a very comfortable bed, it also had an armchair and ottoman and a large desk/workspace. The bathroom was not the biggest, but it was clean and had good counter space. I had a partial view of the waterfront, although it was mostly obscured by other buildings. High-speed internet worked well but was not free. I ordered room service for breakfast. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and polite. My food arrived in 15 minutes, exactly when I was told it would, and was prepared to order. The fitness center was clean but small. There was a decent selection of free weights and enough treadmills for everyone who wanted to use them. My only complaint was that there were only two ellipitical machines and both were in use for over half an hour. The waterfront is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, but be forewarned that the walk entails some pretty steep hills. I did the walk pretty early in the morning (about 7 a.m.) and the neighborhood seemed very safe at that time. Over all, this hotel fit my needs perfectly.

If you are a light sleeper, ask for a high floor, away from the Interstate. Minor annoyances: not enough towels in the bathroom, in-room Internet connection would not work properly, room access cards kept getting desensitized. However, friendly and responsive staff made up for it. The hotel is well located, some six blocks from Pike Place Market.

We ordered room service which was delivered within 20 mins, and was of great quality, we were so tired we just watched TV, ate our food and went to bed! In the morning check out was fast, and we walked a couple of blocks north to a lovely shop which sold everything and had a cafe attached to it - had mocha and muffin for breakfast before going back to the hotel to be picked up and taken to the port. The only downside to this hotel I think would be location, it isn't right in the centre of the shopping area, so if you want to do shopping stay nearer to that area (recommend Grand Hyatt).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR31914059">Don't stay there if you are a light sleeper. The hotel must have been built many years ago. The decor is pretty outdated although the room is clean.

Then there was a small problem with the room so they upgraded me an executive corner suite with a view of the harbor, Space needle and Lake Union.. My wife would open all the drapes and admire the views day and night (a Grays Anatomy fan). Hotel food was outstanding and about 20% more than eating at a hole in the wall. A concierge found me wandering and offered to show me the hotelâ€™s offerings. The most memorable of which is the 28th floor pool and hot tub with a floor to cieling 2 wall view of the city. Be sure to take your swim trunks. I could go on but my final opinion is that it was the best value, treatment, and service I have ever received. When you leave the hotel, the hills are killers.

There are a few caveats, as a few others mentioned: the proximity to the freeway can be bothersome if you're a light sleeper (and get a room on that side of the building); the heating/cooling fan is fully automatic, regardless of what you push; the sliding bathroom door is neat, but doesn't offer much privacy.

Twenty-eight dollars per night to park at the hotel, ten dollars per day per person for a continental breakfast, thirteen dollars per night for wireless internet, etc. They also make you pay tax on things such as parking and wireless internet. Additionally, we could hear the guests next door loud and clear. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up, the closet doors wouldn't shut, and their was no fan in the bathroom.

We returned around 7:30 and found a strange note and antique looking computer speakers on our bar (no there are no liqueurs or fridge).

I called the front desk to let them know the mistake and I had to explain a dozen different ways for the girl to understand what I was saying, although I highly doubt she had a clue after all since she sent two security guards to our room and they took the note and speakers from my husband as if they were going to detonate!

The staff members are friendly and begin to recognize me quickly. The rooms are clean and the beds are really comfortable. The hotel is generally pretty quiet but I recommend asking for a room facing away from the highway because it can be a bit noisy on the lower levels. My only complaint is around parking. The streets around the hotel are all one way and the hotel parking garage is underground with a really narrow winding drive where you drive in the left hand lane.

Our room was very clean and comfortable. Parking is pretty expensive so be prepared for that. Not a lot of restaruants are within walking distance of the hotel which is bad if you do not have a car.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18446158">I DON"T RECOMMEND STAYING AT THIS HOTEL. I stayed at this hotel in June. I thought that because it was newly renovated that it would look better than the last time I stayed here. I was so disappointed to see an old looking carpet which to me didn't look so clean. I'm not sure if they replaced the carpet at all. I have been to other Renaissance Hotels and they all look very contemporary, nice and clean. This Renaissance (Seattle) is so ugly, dark and dirty looking. It looks like nothing has changed sine the 70s. The price per night isn't reasonable at all. Overall, I wasn't pleased with their service and I feel like its a waste of money to stay at this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18112368">I had a very disappointing experience at this hotel. The room faced the highway and if I looked out the window I could view either traffic jams or a construction project. Traffic noise could only be drowned out if you kept the room fan on. What was more disappointing, however, was the quality of the room and services. The furniture was shoddy and worn. On my second day there the hotel had run out of caffeinated coffee packets with which to make coffee in the room. Running out of coffee in Seattle??? While coffee was brought up to my room on the successive three days I was there, I had to ask for it each time. On my last evening, I specifically asked for coffee to be brought to the room and did not want a wake up call. Well--I got the wake up call before 6am (!) and no coffee. I certainly won't go back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17738432">We stayed at this Hotel the 1st of June. There was a group of us so we were all over this Hotel. It seems that some of the rooms on the upper floors have been remolded with new furniture, flat screen, etc. Our room on the 9th floor had not been. Lots of noise! We were facing the Highway and it was very noisy. However other people in our party stayed on the upper floors facing the back of the Hotel and didn't have problems with the noise. The room was nice enough. Not great but not bad. I did have one really disgusting problem. I drank out of one of there glasses in the room that are furnished. I had lipstick on and when I left the room later on that morning the maid came and washed the glasses in the room and let me say not with soap! My lipstick was still on the glass! I had seen stuff like this on 60 mininutes and never thought about it again, until now! So from then on I drank only out of there disposable cups. Everyone that worked here especially the Concierge were really nice and helpful. When you arrive they will give you a map of the city. The yellow part of the map show's where the bus rides are free in a large area of downtown. I felt pretty safe during the day. I walked all over downtown and took the bus several time's. (People are really great if you have bus questions). At night we didn't walk around at all! And were told not to be several of the local people. All in all its an ok hotel. Probably wouldn't stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17713128">We stayed here on a recent vist to Seattle because they took our Marriott Any Time certificate which I received for credit card miles. It came with free breakfast for 2 which the waiter extended into a full breakfast for 3. I think what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. They were all very friendly and accommodating and this made our stay. The room we had was large and well ventilated away from I-5. The roof level pool had great vistas of Seattle. The palce was very clean. The only drawbacks were the off center location and the colorless lobby. For us it was a good deal. For full price try for a more close in location. However it should be noted the hotel sits right on the free dwtown bus loop so that makes getting anywhere downtown easy<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17666831">When we arrived we were given a "junior suite" because of our Marriott Silver Status. The upgraded room was a joke. Switches were broken, the linens were old, the bed sagged, the LCD TV was sitting on the radiator so you could not see it while in bed. In addition it was nearly impossible to move around the king size bed because there was no walking room. We had a room away from the highway but the road noise was still very bad. My wife didnot sleep a wink all night. In the morning we canceled the last 2 days of our reservation and moved to the TownePlace Suites near the airport. It was half the price and a much better than the Renaissance. This was the worst Marriott I have every stayed at. STAY AWAY<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17091355">I read most of the reviews and I agree with some of them and others not. Yes, the televisions are old and there are no microwaves or fridges in the room. But in my opinion staying in this hotel all depends on where your room is located. I was unfortunately on the side facing Interstate 5 and I was on the 5th floor. The noise was definitely troublesome to say the least. It wasn't bad getting to sleep if you like "white noise" in the background, but if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night it was difficult to go back to sleep. It's amazing that the traffic on the I-5 was constant all night long... I mean at 3:00 am there was a lot of traffic coming and going. Overall, the staff was nice and there were some nice features in the hotel. I walked to a ballgame at Safeco Field and it was about a 20 minute walk. The hotel was within walking distance to most of the attractions. The library is one block away and you can use their internet and computers if you need to check your e-mail. You just tell the library staff you are visiting from out of town and they give you one free hour of internet and computer use. I didn't have car with me so I have nothing to add about the parking. I took the Gray Line bus from the airport and it drops you off right in front of the hotel. This was a business trip for me so I didn't have to pay for the hotel out of my pocket. If I had paid for the hotel I would not have been a little more upset about the noise.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16780602">From the moment we checked in, our stay at the Renaissance Seattle was great. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. Although a bit small, the room was spotless and very comfortable. The food prices--including room service--were extremely affordable, and all the food we had was amazing. The fitness center was also nice, and the location was great for what we wanted to do--walking distance to Pike Place Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, Pioneer Square, and Safeco Field (although I wouldn't recommend the walk back from Pioneer Square or Safeco Field simply because it is mostly up very steep hills). I would certainly recommend this hotel to pretty much anyone looking for a great stay in Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16718867">I'm the first to admit that upon reading the reviews on TripAdvisor about the Renaissance Seattle I was really tempted to change my reservation - but given that I had an excellent rate (friend got me a discount) and the other hotels in the area were at least twice as much, I held my breath, said a prayer and hoped for the best. You really should see it for yourself and the only thing I regret about my stay is that I didn't take any pictures of the place to post here. The room renovations are up to date, trendy and stylish. I often travel for business and I don't usually sleep well in a hotel the first night but had no problems here. Television is now flat-screen - no fridge in the room but with turndown service nightly we got a fresh bucket of ice. Admittedly, the room size is a bit smaller than most, but they were still comfortable and roomy enough to hang out in for a couple of hours during the day. Someone in an earlier review mentioned not having a fan for the bathroom and there isn't a seperate fan (which I was worried about) but the four days I was there I never found it to be a problem. Infact, this bathroom often cleared out faster than some others in hotels that do have separate fans. Unlike some other Marriott properties, this one does have wireless in the rooms. If you have two laptops with wireless you either need to pay twice for the internet access OR someone will need to write down the access code and you'll have to take turns. I called the front desk on this and tried to get them to understand when you've got two people traveling, and two people with two seperate laptops that need to use their own laptop for business purposes paying twice for the service seems stupid, but I didn't win that battle. And the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They've got a great crew there and I would not hesitate to stay there again. Had dinner one night in the lounge on the top floor - relaxing, priced about what I would expect for a hotel restaurant/lounge, and incredible biews. The one downside is that it is a bit further away from the rest of the "toursity" area of Seattle, but it's not like it's an unreasonable walk either. Another individual suggested taking 6th when walking if you want it to be a little less hilly and that's a great suggestion too. There is a city bus that within certain areas is free and for a nominal amount will take you other places as well. Most things are within walking distance though. In the few days we were there we walked to the monorail that took us to Seattle Center, walked to Pike's Market, the ferry pier, to Pioneer Square, and to Safeco Field without any problem or troubles. I've stayed at a number of Marriott properties (have marriott elite status) and this is one of the nicest I've been to and would not hesitate to stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16592188">Business trip - first time to city and found hotel disappointing. The lobby area and other public areas lacked character. The bedroom was small and slightly shoddy. The restaurant was okay for breakfast but not attractive for evening (I didn't even go as far as looking at the menu). And to cap it all was the price. I found this hotel expensive and not good value for money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16536167">...and it is almost bright enough to read by. Despite the remodel, the curtains are very poorly fit to the window, which is recessed. Could be substantially alleviated by a better fit, and one of those short curtains that cover the top part, hung on the outside of the recess. I hate it when it is obvious that a renovation is done purely for visual aesthetic, and no member of management has ever actually tried to sleep in the room. Room on the 21st floor, on the opposite side from the freeway, is still pretty noisy, though not enough to bother me, since I use a white noise machine anyway -- but I pity the poor traveller who gets a low room on the freeway side, which also happens to face east, meaning the light problem is no doubt even worse. Otherwise, everything else about the place is nice, followiing the remodel. A much better hotel to look at than to sleep in, though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16196682">So I read most of the reviews before staying here and, honestly, considered changing my reservations. I'm glad that I didn't. The place is very nice, located up some steep hills (if you're walking), there's construction going on and a freeway to look. But if you can get past that (we did, pretty easily, too) it's a nice property. Being a platinum member, I called ahead and asked to be upgraded. We got a room on the 26th floor with views of Seattle on three sides. Smallish room with a separate sitting area. Same floor as the club lounge, so that was nice. Hotel was clean, everyone acted very professional and there's plenty of things to walk to within just a few blocks. We didn't rent a car here and, if you can avoid it, I wouldn't do it. It's too costly and Seattle is a good cab city. I would stay here again, but would like check out the Marriott on the waterfront first, just for a little variety. Also, paid $135 with a VIP card, so all things considered, it was a very good deal.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15441449">Arrived at the hotel having requested a quiet non smoking room to be told that they did not have a one free, we were given one which overooked the very busy and noisy freeway and someone had been smoking in the non smoking room. We were also told upon arrival that the hotel was going through a refurbishment and to expect noise from 7am! We requested another room after just 2 hours sleep due to the high level of noise and were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was more noisy than the previous room. The rooms had double galzing which might as well not have been there. After zero sleep the next night I asked if there was an alternative room on a higher floor or a sister hotel which we could move to which was quieter...the night porter's very rude reply was 'well if you think we're paying for you to move your greatly mistaken' (I did not ask them to pay, only to see if they could get us into another hotel) after the tone of the porter, very little sleep in two nights and a wedding to go to the next day we decided to check out of the hotel at 11.45pm and move to a hotel closer to our friends (not part of the same hotel group), we were charged for 3 nights accommodation (which we think was disgraceful), the porter didn't even offer to call us a cab to get to the new hotel so we stood on the street corner for 30 minutes before catching one to a nicer, quieter hotel. I would not stay at the hotel again and would appreciate a reply to these comments.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14947404">I booked a 3 night stay on Priceline ($80/night Sat - Mon) and once I got the name of the hotel I did my research...I was scared after reading some of these reviews. But there was no need - this is a great place for that price. The staff was amazingly friendly and accomodating (brought a bottle opener to the room and changed my room as requested). The room was comfortable and nicely appointed. This room had everything that I would expect for this class of hotel. The renovations are up to date and stylish. Make sure to go to the 28th floor for a nightcap - the view is worth it! Parking is a little pricey but there is a surface lot about 2 blocks away on 8th that is $15 for the day - if you don't mind getting up early to buy the ticket. Street parking in the area after 6 PM is free so take advantage of that. If you plan on walking, you can avoid some of the hills by walking down 6th to Pike Street and then left to the market - it is a fairly flat walk unlike going down Madison.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13244203">I stayed for one night at the Renaissance Marriott in Seattle.

I went to the front desk and asked for another room and was told there weren't any. I told them I was calling my travel agent. While on the phone, a manager from the hotel approached me and asked me to see if this other room was better. It was on the other side of the building which was quiet, but it was no less decrepit. Old worn out furniture, a very tiny room with occluded windows from water leakage and an iron with a broken handle and exposed electronics. One night is all is all I can stay.

I really like Marriott hotels and am nudging Gold status, so I was surprised when I got a cramped little room overlooking the Interstate. I complained and got a better room. Like so many hotels in Marriott's Renaissance chain, the Seattle Renaissance is old, tired and run down. The decor is early 1970s with carpeting that dates from that era. I noticed in the restaurant carpeting that was worn and stained. My room had dark wood and cabinetry that was cheap and ill fitting. I could not get my closet door to close properly. The lamp on my bedside table kept falling off. And as others have noted, each bed has a weird cloth headboard that is both unnecessary and probably unhygienic. I used the fitness center, but unless you got there before 5 am you were out of luck for a workout due to the limited number of machines. As I said, I am a huge fan of the Marriott chains. Why their Renaissance flagship brand is so consistently lousy, with the wonderful exception of the Mayflower in Washington, beats me.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10171603">I chose this hotel because I am a Marriott rewards member, and this was the closest hotel in the chain to my destination downtown. This was my third stay at the hotel, and once again I had to ask (after checking in) to be moved from a room overlooking I-5 even after I had specifically made the request, and was assured by the reservationist, that I would not receive a room on that side of the hotel. I understand that they need to move those rooms but the whole check-in charade has gotten old. However, the biggest complaint I had was the lack of free wireless internet. The fee for wired internet service is $10/day. The hotel staff I encountered during my stay were all very friendly, from the housekeeping personnel to the room service staff. They were the ones who made my overall stay much more pleasant. Next time I travel on business in the Seattle area though I'll probably stay at either the Spring Hill Suites or Residence Inn downtown - they seem to have the accommodations which more closely fit my needs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10000028">The headboard of the bed is covered with a fabric material that may attract uninvited guests. After traveling cross country, I decided to retreat to my room and take a nap before the afternoon conference I was attending. When I woke up, I felt an itch on my scalp/forehead and found not one, but two ticks. The ticks had not yet attached to my skin, so they were recently acquired. I had not been to any other location (straight from airport to Renaissance). I took the ticks to the front desk and explained the situation. The staff first offered to fog the room. I did not find this acceptable and was given a different room. The new room was very comfortable and clean. The hotel manager gave me vouchers for breakfast daily during the stay for the inconvenience. Although I had no further problems, I don't think I would stay again because of the tick problem.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8735922">This is definitely not what you would expect from a Marriott Hotel, and as a Marriott Rewards Member with silver status I know what I'm talking about.

Definitely no 4-star location. Next time I'll have to visit Seattle, I'll try to get another hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8716531">From reading these reviews, it sounds like a complete different hotel than the one we stayed at. We stayed 9/12-9/15 and had a room on the "club level" floor 26. To say the rooms needed updating was an understatement. I am not usually one to care about what decade a style is in, but is a problem is when decades of dirt cause everyone in the room to itch and produce a rash. This was the case. Everytime we left the room, we could breath and did not itch. Return to the room and it began again. Carpet is a multi dark color which did a lot to hide the years of goodness knows what. We did not dare walk barefoot. Carpet was also tore up in every doorway and tiles were loose in the bathroom. Usually when a hotel remodels it starts with the most expensive room, so remodels are a long way off. Beds were beds, nothing special. Bathroom the size of a closet, forget closing the door, it was not possible. For those that need to know, friends of ours requested a handicap room because one of them is in a wheelchair. There is no handicap room! It is a regular room with a couple of shower bars as a minumum legal requirement. NOT ONE SERVICE PERSONAL other than check in and the bar of course, spoke complete and coherent English. You need to know this if you want to communicate with housekeeping staff, or anyone in the gift store. It is incredibly frustrating to tell housekeeping to please leave extra towels over and over and have to draw pictures. The so called "parking garage" is unmanned on entry and completely unsafe! You need to know this. It is in a dark, shadowed underground with exceptionally tight spaces. Elevators are not clear. You actually have to enter doorways to stairs and go up a flight to reach an elevator in some places. ANYONE can be in these stairways and believe me in this part of town, anyone is. BE CAREFUL! Check in however was a breeze, check out also. This is where the English speaking folks are hidden. And the bar too of course, where they want to take your money without aggrevating you. However, please note, my credit card has been charged twice for the entire stay and I am having the worst time resolving the issue. For some reason, they feel compelled to keep connecting me to the "front desk" of the hotel. These folks do not do billing. I am still trying after 2 days...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8615982">I booked the Renaissance through Priceline and got a very good deal, more than half off the hotel's internet price. So, I was worried that the hotel would be dumpy. Thankfully it was far from dumpy. It was great! Fantastic location. Excellent service. We booked a king size room and were given a one-bedroom suite. It was nicely furnished, large and very comfortable. I am very picky about bedding and the bedding met my high standards. The sheets were high thread count, smooth and covered the comforter completely (top and bottom sort of forming a duvet). The complementary coffee service in the morning was great. They also gave us parking ($25) for free. The food was good in the restaurants too. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel exterior is under construction so it's hard to see the name as you are driving by. Note: The hotel is right next to the freeway, but the soundproofing makes it hardly noticeable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8579760">We live in Vancouver, BC, and often spend weekends in Seattle. Having used Priceline's "Name Your Own Price" function many times, we are always happy when we get the Renaissance. It's much nicer than the Crowne Plaza or the Red Lion, and waaaay better than the sketchy Holiday Inn Express that you can get stuck with on Priceline. The Renaissance lobby is lovely, the staff friendly, the rooms large, clean, and comfortable, the pool and gym very nice, and the location convenient enough. When we stay here we often walk to Pike Place, the Crocodile, and to the Space Needle and back several times during our stay. People who don't like to walk as much might find it a bit far from the Space Needle area, but that's why you stop at the NiteLite halfway for a drink! The hotel parking is atrocious, we only use it when we're going to Bumbershoot and don't want to waste time coming back to move our car. But normally we use street parking-it's plentiful, close to the hotel, and free during evenings/Sundays/holidays. I would never pay 260 dollars a night for this place, but for the three nights we have it booked this coming weekend we payed 258 dollars instead of the 700+ it would have been through their website. And that's during the Labor Day/Bumbershoot weekend when hotels are scarce. Seattle is an expensive hotel town. Even the Moore costs more than what we pay for the Renaissance, and it's a very budget boutique hotel. It's a good deal.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8448620">We got a great deal on priceline (&lt;$100/night) but were treated as if we paid full price.

The Grayline shuttle from Sea Tac drops you off in front of the hotel and is very inexpensive.

The exterior of the hotel, its hallways and rooms appear to need some updating, as all appeared to be a bit worn. However, the room that we took was sparkling clean. The location of this Renaissance is great for touring the city, and it's tied with the Renaissance-Tobu in Tokyo, Japan for having the most accomodating and kind employees that I've ever encountered.

I was in a corner room on the 14th floor facing the Sound, but the freeeway noise was very noticeable and the room was very cold because of all the glazing. The room was large, and I guess was probably very nice in the early 90's when it appears to have last been renovated. There are strange built-in drawers below the windows, the furniture is in bad shape, the lighting poor, and the desk is small.

Well, was I shocked. The room was straight out of the 70s (or earlier). Worn carpet, worn furniture, ancient bathroom. It was satisfactory, and I was in no mood to move to a different hotel, but I thought about it. Then, I tried to use the Internet. Sorry, all, that just sucks at this hotel. I had to do several hours of work online and transfer a few files around. It was slower than an old fashioned modem (remember those?). I spent an hour on the phone with their Internet dept, and they kept claiming people at the hotel were sharing files which was overloading the network - they did make it slightly better. It took all night for the files to transfer at this hotel. For comparison, I had to do the same work a few days earlier from a Westin in Canada and was done in under an hour. Totally unacceptable.

The thing that I was not prepared for was the $23 a night parking fee in the parking garage. Very low ceilings. Would not be albe to park there if you had an suv. Overall it was a pleasant experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6622305">We stayed at this Seattle hotel for one night only in early December. We arrived late Friday night and were told that the highest floor they could put us on was the 4th floor. We had booked on Priceline, and are used to getting the "leftovers" as it relates to the rooms. But we were happy that they got us into a king-size bed. We didn't mind being "only" on the 4th floor, but I suspected that they are aware that there is some highway noise, and the higher up, the less noise. Nevertheless, the room was adequate - not luxurious. But we had paid a very reasonable price through priceline. If you have stayed in many "downtown" hotels, you know that there is a very high price to be paid for large perfect rooms without flaws. This room wasn't perfect, certainly, there was a chip on the bathroom door, that type of thing, but it was fine. And we didn't experience any troublesome noise from the highway. Mostly the reason that we are rating this hotel so high is because of the friendly staff and the great value we got on priceline. I would have been very unhappy with this hotel had I paid $150 or $200 per night. In the morning, at the breakfast buffet, we were treated to a wonderfully friendly server who couldn't have been more delightful and helpful. He helped us with our plan to walk down to Pike Place Market and chatted with us about the weather in Seattle ;-). The breakfast was fabulous and I don't think I've ever had a better waffle! The location is PRETTY good for getting to the Marketplace. The way there is all downhill so no problem. I would definitely recommend the bus system to get back. In the off-season, it's free. But it would be worth the small amount in the peak season as well. It is a very steep uphill climb to get back. We would definitely return but ONLY if we got a really good rate again. I would not pay over $100 for a room here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6482311">If you are thinking of booking a room at this hotel, JUST DON'T DO IT!!! I traveled to Seattle with 3 work colleagues for a seminar. We booked our room through Priceline, asking for a 3-star hotel in downtown Seattle, and got reservations at the Renaissance (supposedly a 4-star hotel). What a disaster! Half of us got rooms on the I-5 freeway side of the building. The noise there was so bad (large container trucks rumbling by all night) that we had to switch rooms. Even earplugs didn't help block out the noise. The rooms were also pretty shabby, with scratched up, damaged furniture. When we complained to the management and asked to switch rooms, they told us that the Priceline rooms were discounted rooms, so we shouldn't expect the same quality as "full paying guests"!!! We ended up having to pay an extra $25 per night just to get adequate rooms. The other half of my group got rooms on the other side of the hotel. There was construction going on from early in the morning until quite late at night. These rooms were also terribly noisy, but earplugs at least cut out much of that noise. The staff acted like complaints from guests about not being able to sleep because of the noise was old news that they didn't want to hear about. They acted indignant that we would dare to complain and were extremely rude and dismissive. Also, the ice machines were broken on most floors (we had to search 3 floors to find a working one) and there was no attempt to fix them. There was no minibar or even a mini refrigerator in the rooms. There was a spot where the refigerator used to be be, but they had removed them all. The Renaissance bills itself as a 4-star hotel. If that rating is based solely on the hotel lobby, I'd give it 3 stars. Based on the shabby rooms, the noise, the lack of service, and the rude staff, I would be stretched to give it 1 star! We will never stay at a Renaissance Hotel again!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6448752">The Renaissance Seattle tries to pass itself off as a first-rate facility, but it is not. The hotel was renovated in the not-too-distant past, but it still has the atmosphere of a gloomy, 1970s-era concrete bunker. Desk staff were reasonably friendly, but totally unknowledgeable, even of facilities in their own hotel. The rooms were less than spotless, and the hallways were literally strewn with dishes, glasses, trays, etc. that went unretrieved by hotel staff for about 12-16 hours at a time during our stay. Although we were staying on a non-smoking floor, the hallways also reeked of cigarette smoke for some reason. I found my bed incredibly uncomfortable -- the mattress was hard as a rock. Even worse, when we checked in, desk staff did not inform us that one side of the hotel faces the I-5 highway and is **incredibly** noisy, even 20 stories up, even with the window shut, even in the middle of the night. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. Had I known this, I would have requested a room on the other side of the hotel -- but better staff would have automatically tried to be accommodating, where possible. Parking, not surprisingly, was excessively expensive. In short, our stay was little short of terrible. I would recommend this hotel to my worst enemy -- no one else.

Because of this I was able to hear everything that went on in the next door. This included conversations, television shows and the adjoining door was being jiggled constantly. On Wednesday, my room internet stopped working. They continued to charge me $9.95 everyday for the service. Even though the hotel had other rooms available they would not move me.

We arrived on Friday and left on Monday, and had no problem checking in or out, which took 2 minutes. The room wasn't too bad except we were assigned a room facing the freeway. The noise from the freeway didn't bother us at all and we were on the 10th floor. The bed was nice and comfortable. The most impressive service at this hotel was the concierge. Fred, one of the attendants took care of quite a few things for us before we arrived.

The trouble started the moment we arrived. To my utter astonishment, not one of the four valet parking attendants on staff knew how to operate a manual transmission. Maybe I'm a progressive thinker, but I would have thought that knowing how to drive a car would be a basic prerequisite for being a valet attendant. After parking the car myself, we found the lobby to be PACKED with people and the lineup for the front desk literally had dozens of people in it. It was obvious that it would take close to an hour to even reach the check-in desk. I have Marriott Elite status as a frequent Marriott guest, so after trying to get the concierge's attention for several minutes, I was finally able to ask him if they have a dedicated Elite check-in line as they do at many properties, to which he replied, "no, we got rid of that." Frustrated, we left and went to the W instead, where we had a great stay. Apart from our bad experience, the decor of the hotel appeared tired and dated. I realize that that it wouldn't be completely fair to blame the hotel for the timing of our arrival and the crowd in the lobby, but the combination of the incompetent valet parkers and the hotel staff's poor handling of the situation in the lobby will guarantee that I definitely won't book at the Seattle Renaissance again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5234718">The Renaissance Seattle Hotel provided for a nice, spontaneous &amp; romantic getaway to Seattle. It was my first reservation made on Priceline. I was able to get a room at the Renaissance for $129/night + taxes. The hotel is in a good location, and it's the typical old but not quaint downtown hotel. We were able to request a king, non-smoking room with a view of the Sound and downtown at time of check-in.

The rooms have always been immaculate and the hotel is well-maintained. Room service is quick and the complimentary beverage service in the morning is great. The location is within walking distance of tons of restaurants and shopping. The only thing so-so thing has been the restaurant food and service at the italian restaurant inside the hotel. The prices are average and the service is slow so I'd recommend checking out the other restaurants in the area before eating here.

Service was good (a little too good maybe, hotel workers were knocking on the door to check on things 3-5 times daily). I ordered room service a couple of times and the service and food were both great. There is a pool and workout facility in the hotel which is pretty good, too.

The people working at the hotel are helpful, efficient and are willing to assist you at the drop of a hat; the only concern I have about their abilities are their errors and lack of knowledge about public transportation--they made casual mistakes about the bus routes from the airport and around the general area--look at the Seattle PT website before you leave! This is not a hotel best suited to the poorer tourist! As for the rooms, they are attractive, clean and have some stylistic leanings toward art deco, and are befitting the renaissance chain. My friend and I did worry about the darkness in the bathtub when the shower curtains are closed--they need some sort of lighting!

Here is my take on the hotel and room: Room - I called the hotel a week before my stay to request a king bed and a quiet room based on the feedback I got from other folks on Tripadvisor. When I got to the hotel, I asked them again for the same requirements. I was given a king bed and a room not directly facing the freeway but still within viewing distance. In addition, the room was on the 6th floor so you can still hear the freeway noise. I requested for another room, but they could only give me one floor higher but still within viewing distance of the freeway. So, it didn't make sense to move. At this point, I was very upset since I've made my request ahead of time. However, I must admit the room was quite big for the price we paid and the bed was pretty comfortable. Wake up call w/beverage - I thought this was a great service the hotel offered. I got the hot cocoa and it was delicious. This sort of made up for my disappointment of the room. Parking - Parking in the hotel is expensive ($21/day). You can go to other garages for a bit less but you would need to move your car early in the morning. Also, you can park in the street at certain times for free but not the full 24 hours. So, I suggest not renting a car. However, we did find parking up the street past the freeway on 8th avenue which was free for the whole day, but availability is very limited. Late night cravings - the hotel is a bit of a walk from the main shopping/restaurant area...so not much choices nearby. However, we did find a pub that opened late and cheap too which was on 4th avenue... i can't remember the name. The pub was recommended by the concierge...so definitely take advantage of that service...they are very helpful. Hotel Staff - I have to say I was impressed with the hotel staff...bellstand, concierge, maid service...they were very helpful. One day during our vacation, it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella. I called housekeeping to request one and they made sure I got one. So, initially I was going to give a rating of 2 due to the problems I encountered with requesting a quiet room. But based on the customer service I received from the hotel staff...I changed it to 3. However, if you are paying full price...there are other alternatives you want to consider which are closer to the public market.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126661690">They were very flexible for my very late arrival and flexed my check out time as well.

Web research prior to this trip suggested that the top floor had a restaurant that would be a good choice for dinner but it is no longer open for dinner (which is only served in a lobby bar) but becomes the executive lounge after 3pm.

I only booked for one night thinking I might not stay given the reviews but wound up staying all 3 nights. It is just an avg. hilton, but it has a very good location and seems very reasonably priced and thus the 4 out of 5 given good value for a slightly above avg. large city Hilton. Rooms &amp; baths were not overly small as some indicated, but again avg. The views varied greatly. The city w/ water view is what you want on a high floor. As others indicated, the breakfast on the top floor is very good and the top floor is the lounge in the evening which was significantly better than the avg. Hilton Honors Lounge. I would recommend this property particularly for HHonors members. The Homewood suites are bit further away although one is right down on the water but the water is a nice 5-8 minute walk from here. It is uphill on the way back if that is an issue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120181200">Christine, the concierge, gave us a wonderful welcome to Seattle, and we enjoyed an excellent buffet before heading out on a day of adventure in Seattle.

Then walk 3 blocks (left side) to the hotel. There is no way of accessing the lobby from the street but you have to go up an elevator. The lobby is the smallest plainest one I've ever seen!! Staff were friendly Access to the exec lounge was available (HHonors) and the food was plain and the soft drinks were free but you had to pay for all others. The view from the Top was nice though. The bedroom was tiny and dated but the bed was comfortable.

We were there for 4 days on business trip. The trip was set up as direct bill with credit card needed by our company employees only for incidentals. Instead, the front desk billed some of our guests for entire stay taking funds from their debit or credit cards. It took a few days to have funds reversed. The rooms are small and out-dated, even on the executive floor. Finally, the management decided to do some plumbing work and shut off all water to rooms one night in a large section of the hotel at 10pm. They said the water would return by 4am. At 7:30am the water was not back on, so toilets could not be flushed, showers weren't available, etc. This lack of water on a business trip made the experience aggravating and uncomfortable. It reflected poor decision-making on the part of the hotel management as it affected many guests.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118772352">Handy location and walkable to pikes peak Market, monorail for space needle.

Air con unit in our room was very original and was so loud that we couldn't have it on at night, the toilet flush was broken and the shower control was missing parts.

We stayed on executive level (25th floor) which gave us breakfast vouchers for both mornings. The vouchers are good for complimentary buffet or a value of $14.95 to order off the menu. Buffet is on the top floor with a outstanding view of Seattle &amp; Cruise terminals! Staff was excellent. We used the hotel concerierge to book a few tours &amp; dining arrangements. All recommendations were spot on GREAT! We were even surprised with a complimentary appeitizer one night at dinner from the concerierge!!! Room was beautiful &amp; beds were comfortable! Everyone states how small the bathrooms are (????) It was not that small. We found everything to be satisfactory.

Easy to get to from the I5 coming in from Canada. The only small wierd thing was how the lobby was on an upper floor because it was separated from the ground level by parking.

A little out of the way and doesn't feel like a Hilton. The hotel has an odd smell--like fresh air never gets in the building. The rooms were very average and the bathroom very small. Although I am a Hilton Honors member there was no acknowledgement or room update that I usually receive. Food was typical bad Hilton and over priced. Arrived late so didn't really have any other choice. But definitely many better Seattle restaurants for the same price or cheaper. What I will have to say is that down to a person the service was outstanding. Every staff person went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. Everyone was personable and tried to give you little tips to make your stay better (e.g., the escalator was out at the metro station). Just need to take this outstanding staff and give them a better hotel<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117777568">We stayed for a night in September to sightsee in Seattle before moving on to Hawaii for the rest of our vacation. The hotel is well situated for everything we needed to see in the City and close to excellent restaurants. We were allocated a great room on the 25th floor with access to the Exec Lounge where complimentary canapes were served from 5-7pm and drinks were available thereafter. This was the same place where breakfast was served next morning - great views across the bay to start the day. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and we felt welcomed and valued guests.

My first appointment was at 7:20 a.m. so I decided to stay at the Hilton the night before to avoid having to deal with the crush of morning commute traffic. It turned out to be a good decision. If you can walk to the hospital, this is an especially good place to stay. Out the front door, it's one block over and four blocks up the hill to Lindemann Pavilion, where you need to stop and check in (for the hospital). A note of caution, for patients who can't handle hills, it's best to take a cab or find some other way to get up there. Even so, it would be a very short cab ride so the fare would be low. The good news for walkers is, it's all downhill when you are done at Virginia Mason! Wife and I really enjoyed the Hilton. One of our favorite places, The Brooklyn Seafood, Steak, and Oyster House, is four blocks down the hill from the hotel. We had to stagger back up the hill to the Hilton after having consumed a memorable meal, but it was worth it! The hotel was fine, it seemed there were staffpersons everywhere just waiting to help you with questions, etc. Very helpful and courteous. Our room was clean and quiet, though as noted elsewhere the bathroom seemed a bit small. We received our HHonors amenities and even a champagne and chocolate gift in honor of our wedding anniversary. I highly recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117076057">The room was very comfortable and the staff went out of their way to make me welcome and allow an early check in.

Then finally another staff member said to check again that some rooms had been released. We were only staying 2 days.

The hotel was very easy to find from the highway, and parking was a breeze. These are important points to note, as we were ready to get off of the road after our three hour drive from Vancouver, BC. As a member of Hilton Honors, i enjoyed a quick and easy check in with the gracious conceriege. Again, this was very welcome, as were the lovely green apples available at the front desk. Our room was large, clean and included a many useful amenities. The beds were very comfortable, and easily accommodated two people each. Likewise, the bathroom and vanity area left plenty of room for us to get ready at the same time. The location of the hotel was central to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. We walked to the convention centre each day, past lots of terrific shopping, and right down to the famed Public Market. The Hilton Seattle was in close proximity to the best that the city has to offer. Next year, when the ECCC rolls into town, on our next shopping excursion, or when visiting the Pacific Science Centre, you can be sure I will once again stay at the Hilton. Great value from a brand you can trust.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116450537">This hotel has a great location and the lobby area is very clean. The thing that put me off was upon entering our room the light (shade and all) next to our bed was dangling off the wall. We called and had that fixed the next day since we arrived at 2am. Also, we needed non feather pillows. It took them 45 min to deliver them. I would've gone down and get them if that was going to be the case. Also, the room just seemed dated and quite honestly not that clean. But I am kind of a clean freak.

We were very disappointed to find that both hotels were full for the nights we wanted. My husband suggested that we try the Hilton, reminding me that it was closer to much of the "action" - Pike's Market, shopping, Safeco Field (well, that is about a half hour walk away), We booked our two night stay online. One of the options was to book a room which gave us access to the Executive Lounge (room price was around $210 Canadian - internet and parking extra). When we arrived, we went for a drink to unwind after our day of travel. The Executive Lounge had a great selection of appetizers (free of charge) and reasonably priced drinks. Unfortunately, we had other plans for our second day and we didn't get back to the lounge. The room also included breakfast both days. We were given the choice of ordering from the menu or going to the buffet. The buffet had a good selection of breakfast food (eggs, sausage, bacon, breads of all varieties, cereal, etc.) but also had cold meats, fruit and some fantastic lox to go with your bagels and cream cheese. The service was fantastic - they were quick to bring us our own coffee pot and the staff was extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is undergoing some renovations (most seem complete) but they didn't interfere with our pleasant stay. Our only concern was that parking was at a premium. The first day we had no trouble finding space, but after arriving back at the hotel around 7:30 on the second day, it was so busy that the hotel manager was directing parking and we were directed to go to the 9th (and top) floor to find a spot. This was likely because it was a Saturday night and there was at least one wedding reception being held in the hotel. All in all, it was a wonderful stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, or to recommend this hotel to anyone!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116116118">You notice when a hotel pays attention to the small details, the kind that make a property excellent . . . and you notice when they don't. On the surface, this Hilton looks fine: the lobby is decorated in traditional sophisticated tones. The rooms are large with modern furniture and nice flat screen TVs. The staff is super friendly. But once you start paying attention to anything beyond the gloss, this hotel loses stars quickly. First, the bathrooms are tiny. Like, so small that the door can't stay open because it runs into the show curtain. Considering that most of the furniture (the desk, the dresser) in the room was clearly too big for the space (pushed side-by side, with no space between them), I would have been willing to sacrifice a couple of feet in the bedroom and smaller furniture for a slightly bigger bathroom. The upstairs restaurant was closed for rooftop repairs, so breakfast was served in a large, windowless conference room that was eerily quiet. Okay, these things happen: repairs must me made, and they had to serve breakfast somewhere. But the food was awful and expensive. My Garden Scramble was overcooked and dry. My husband's french toast was better, but fairly gummy. And the two together cost $37. That was the amazing part -- they stick you in some large conference room with awful lighting and no ambiance, and don't think to reduce their prices at all. The next night we got a chocolate lava cake to take to our room. It was advertised as having a warm chocolate interior. And when we bit into it, it was cold, cold, cold. Okay, still delicious (it was chocolate, after all), but another example of how they just don't pay attention. The internet is expensive at $10.95/day. My husband and I have separate computers, so before paying for the internet we called downstairs to ask if the daily charge would cover both of our devices, and we were told yes. Then were charged twice, and were told it's because we used two devices. They did remove the extra charge for that one day, but said in the future it would be $10.95/device/day. Over all, the hotel was fine. The location is convenient, and I'd recommend it only if you get a really good rate, and aren't parking your car.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116097232">I previously had a problem with Hilton Hotels but I gave this one a try on my last trip and was presently surprised. The best part was that there was free wireless internet in the lobby which was also the lounge so you could drink wine and cruise the internet at the same time.

The location is good. I would describe it as an upscale area of the business district. A beautiful view of the Sound or Bay from our window. We had a bit of a walk to Pike Place Market that was mostly flat, then downhill for about a block. The area is beautiful, so walking around was no problem. The room was very nice and clean. The hotel was quiet. I really appreciated getting away from the tourist hubbub each evening. The only downside, there was not much in the way of dining onsite for a family with small children. There is a bar off the lobby with a few tables and chairs and this was the "restaurant". I thought the limited menu looked pretty good for a business traveler, however, for children ages 6 and 11, not many choices. (I suppose that most visitors to Seattle prefer to eat out since there are so many excellent restaurants.) The hotel staff readily recommended a family friendly restaurant (Rock Bottom) less than 1/2 block walk away, which was a very good pizza/brewery with a varied menu but specializing in gourmet pizza choices. So, the inconvenience was very minimal. In fact, when we got to the restaurant, there was another family from the hotel that had been directed there by staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR105618443">I stayed at the Seattle Hilton during April 2011. Frankly I do not understand all these wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor. My tab came to roughly $300 a night for an "Executive Level" room with breakfast. Other than the location the Hilton really has nothing going for it. There are a slew of better hotels for the same rate within spitting distance. The bathrooms are tiny, the shower head was "free floating in the wall", meaning it was not affixed to anything other than the pipe in the wall and at 8:30 am housekeeping banged on the door even though we had put the do not disturb sign on the door the previous night. There was a huge water leak stain on the ceiling above the beds. I very often stay at Hilton hotels and book the Executive Floor rooms, because I like the Executive Lounge idea: complimentary hors d'oeuvres and drinks in the afternoon. Well, guess again. The Seattle Hilton must be the only Hilton I have ever stayed at that charges for this. And conveniently, for them at least, they will not tell you at booking time or when one shows up at the lounge that one is being charged for all this, until one leaves and is presented with this unexpected bill. Choose another hotel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR104541334">I stayed at the Hilton Seattle for 8 days for work. The hotel is in a great location. Right in downtown, close to Pike Place Market, and all the major steakhouses. Great brewpub 2 blocks away called the Tap House, right across the street from Morton's. Tap house has 150 different beers on tap. Front desk staff was very helpful, as was the concierge. We asked the concierge to book 3 of us a table at Daniel's Broiler for dinner. She got us a table right by the window, and a free appetizer of 2 shrimp, 2 oysters, and 2 dungeness crab pieces. Nice! The woman at the front desk had me booked with a corner room, but when she saw how tall I was, she recommended the handicapped room, with the bigger bathroom. Try to get that room if they tell you that you have a corner room. One of my colleagues almost got stuck with a corner room. That room apparently has no desk (just a coffee table), and you need to be under 5'8" to use the shower! He ran right back down to the front desk to have a room change. I was charged $189 a night, AAA rate, for a standard king. Normal rate is $199 a night. Breakfast at the Top of the Hilton was great, but so expensive. $15 for the continental buffet, $22 for full hot buffet, and an a la carte menu as well. I didn't care too much since my company was paying, but take note of the prices. They serve a great Eggs Benedict. The food and the view was great from up there. Next to the front desk is the hotel bar and lounge. Very comfortable seating, and the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Room was clean, bed comfortable. Bathroom a great size. It had shampoo, conditioner, soap, and a hair dryer. I had a nice desk for my laptop. You can print to the hotel printer in the Business Center for free. It is located behind the concierge. There is an instruction card on the desk that tells you how to print there via a website called printspots.com, that will print to that printer. It came in handy for me when I wanted to print out several things. After you print your items, you go to the printer in the Business Center and type in the PIN you selected, and the items will print out for you whenever you want. You do not have do rush downstairs after you print out anything. The parking garage has a lot to be desired. Very tight corners, and tight spaces. I had rented a Dodge Charger, and I was a bit concerned. Just be wary of that. Hotel will get you for about $34 a day for in/out garage privileges. Also, make sure you know which floor you park your car on. I don't know how many times people walked off each floor to look for their car, and run back in the elevator, to go to the next floor! I was guilty of that too! Internet is $11 a day. Both wired and wireless worked fine from my room. On checkout, if you see a room charge on the last page of your bill called 'Shops,' don't be alarmed. That's the total of your Internet charges. I was alarmed myself, until the front desk called Accounting to allay my fears. All in all, a good experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR99285097">Given the point of our weekend getaway was to be centrally located, this fit the bill. However TINY size of the bathroom felt like an airline lavatory. Very few extra's in the room such as adequate coffee, no mini frig unless you had a key to the minibar, which was packed anyway. All things pushed you to buy from the hotel, which here too was very over priced. Wine selection was minimal at the lounge and way over priced for the quality/selection. Overall the hotel was clean, lobby, room, lounge, restaurant, etc. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. Finding the lobby was an odd placement (not on the street level). The blackout curtains did little and the light from the hall came in through the door jam causing me concerns about security. At least use of the room safe was free. However the staff was accomodating to a late check out - but that may have more to do with my level of Hilton points than anything else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR99267976">Look, this hotel could stand a makeover. The decor, and especially the carpets, are from 1988. Time to change. Other than that, everything about this hotel is great. The service was fantastic whether you are checking in or at the bar. I'm not sure if it was because I am a Diamond with Hilton or that I'm good looking, but the woman at the front desk called up after I checked in to see if the room was ok. Probably the former. The staff in the hotel give this place a really good vibe and I would and will 100% stay here again. The location can't be beat as it is walking distance to everything you want in Seattle.

Hotel room was much smaller than a average hotel room, Bathroom was quite small, and agree with the reviews that if a wall was taken down, the bathroom could seem much larger with the sink and shower all in one room... Beds were comfortable, Windows did open. Flat screen TV. Wasn't much room for 2 suitcases, had to use one of the chairs as a luggage carrier. Location was great, HSBC bank right down the block, a couple of blocks from the monorail to the space needle and Pikes Place market.. Safety not a problem. No pool from what I could see, but the shearton has a indoor pool. Only issue was the room was located directly below their top floor resturant, while most of the chairs in the resturant are on carpet, there are some on a tile/marble floor. And when folks shift around in their chairs and walk around, you can hear it in your hotel room. I felt like I was staying in a apartment building rather than a Hilton hotel. Constant banging and shifting of tables and chairs, trust me it got annoying after a while. Thank god it was only 2 nights here and then I moved on. --- Also the Toilet is similar to one in a bus station with a flush handle you would flush with the bottom of your shoe and not you're hands.

We stayed at this Hilton right off I-5 in the heart in the heart of downtown Seattle for 2 nights. We were able to find the hotel easily but not the entrance because it wasn't clearly marked and we expected something more for a large, downtown hotel. We took the elevator to the lobby (on the 9th floor) and checked into room 2402 on the Executive level. We are Hilton Gold VIP's so we got a free upgrade plus free breakfast. We got to our room and found it generally small although clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the beds and had a great time in the Executive lounge upstairs. The staff was nice and so were the snacks they gave out. We went to the "Top of the Hilton Restaurant" on the top floor and had a nice breakfast with great views of Puget Sound. We did check-out early as we were expecting something more for our anniversary and moved to the Westin Downtown which was a very nice hotel. I probably would not stay here again, as I might try the Westin again or try the Arctic Club Doubletree hotel which is a little nicer, I think.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR77211357">Although we have stayed at a few Hilton Hotels over the years, this one was initially a little harder to find primarily because we were looking for a more grand front entrance. Instead, the entrance to the hotel is rather small because the first 8 floors are the parking garage. The lobby is on floor 9. Parking is somewhat pricey at $28 per day. The hotel staff was excellent in the welcome and explaining that all dinning was at the tope floor. Our guest room was suprisingly smaller than we thought for 2 queen beds. The bathroom was especially 'tight'. Yet overall the room was very clean and showed very little wear. Nice flat-screen tv with good decor throughout. We had the continental breakfast whcih was excellent. Available was the large sausage, scrambled eggs, muffins, juice, coffee, thcik slices of bacon and even slices of salmon. The view of the city from the restaurant was not bad either. In all, we have a peaceful stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72490918">Pros: Good Location, Reasonable Price, Very Nice People Cons: Dated, Ugly (atop a 7-8 story parking garage), crappy views for me, really small rooms and bathrooms.

You are within easy walking distance to all of the downtown attractions and on the same block as the theater. The rooms are nice with good appointments, and the maids were really nice. The Hilton Honors lounge was also outstanding. They served a full spread every evening and free breakfast each morning on the top floor. The hotel is a little pricey, but not out of line with the rest of downtown Seattle. The biggest problem is room size. It's fine for a couple, but don't even think about putting more than 2 people in one of these rooms. With two twin beds you can barely walk around, and the bath room is "cozy". Also, if you are taller than 5-9, you will be looking down at your shower head.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR69581311">Typical big city, downtown hotel: elegant exterior, good location but with Comfort Inn-style quality--certainly nothing special to justify the $200+ room rate. A few blocks from water and new light rail system. Rental car kiosk is the first thing you see when you enter the hotel--pretty awkward and tacky. Elevators are really strange and slow. Room was comfortable, but bathroom way too small. The desk staff appeared to be overwhelmed, inexperienced, confused at times. Hidden--i.e., not advertised--$30/day parking fee. Warning: Room service is a COMPLETE rip-off!! They tack on a ridiculously high "delivery charge" IN ADDITION to the food price, tax, and tip you already expect to pay for a meal. I ended up having to pay something like $30 for a small salad listed as about $8.00 on the menu. The poor schmuck who delivered the meal was so embarrassed by the ridiculously high tab, he even apologized to me (BTW, he also works as a cook in the hotel bar/restaurant downstairs). I guess I should have expected this in a hotel that charges $8 for a bag of peanuts and charges for use of the so-called business center computer. Warning #2: Hotel overlooks a plaza with a new bar/restaurant that plays loud outdoor music to late at night. Nice restaurant on top floor but its only open to the scruffy masses for breakfast, lunch. Breakfast resembled a cattle-call with people/kids racing for the buffet bar. Apparently, dinner use is reserved for "special guests/members," whatever that means (probably snobby rich people dumb enough to throw away their $$ to maintain their delusion of elitism).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR66881347">had a view of downtown and the sound! it was great! helpful staff, and excellent food/restaurants just within walking distance!

As an elite Hilton member, we were treated to the executive lounge. Excellent hors d'oerves. The breakfast buffet was just as fresh and plentiful. I would definitely recommend this downtown hotel.

The hotel is in a great location - 10 mins walk to Pike Place Mkt and lots of shops, close to Space Needle and other attractions. The close proximity to everything downtown is the ONLY reason I would ever stay here again. Parking is $28 per night. If you rent a car, try to rent one from National or Alamo so you can return it here and avoid the horrendous parking fee. Our room on the 25th floor looked updated. We did have a partial water view. We decided on two double beds instead of one king bed because our daughter was staying with us for a few hours until her red-eye later that night. We're used to sleeping in queen beds at home so a double was tiny and uncomfortable. The bed was also very firm and the pillows were very mushy. The A/C by the window was loud but turning it off made the room stuffy. We did not get a good night's sleep in this room. Bathroom was clean but tiny, particularly the toilet/shower area. There were more than enough towels and everything felt fresh and clean. We noticed we were at the end of the hall next to the icemaker so we worried about the noise but surprisingly, we didn't hear anything. The elevators seemed efficient. We never had to wait more than a couple minutes. In this hotel, if you want to go up from the lobby, you have to insert your room key into a slot in the elevator or it won't go! I understand why this is done but it got a little annoying at times. Front desk was efficient and friendly and we were checked in very quickly. The concierge was also very helpful when I asked for suggestions and directions to a location. I also used the business center computers to print out a boarding pass. The lobby area was also nice with big comfortable couches and chairs. The fireplace was going when I sat down there to use their free wi-fi. We also had a late dinner at the lobby bar lounge. The burgers are great and the atmosphere is relaxed and unrushed. My husband feels this is the worst Hilton he's ever stayed in because the room was so uncomfortable for him to sleep in but he's spent a lot of nights in quite a few of them and had better sleep. I would still recommend this place only for the great location but I'm not sure I'd stay here again. With all the great hotels in downtown Seattle, I'm sure we could find one with more comfortable rooms.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR61039849">I stayed at the Hilton Seattle in one or two week increments from April 2009 through March 2010. (I did make it home for a few weeks including the major holidays!) I enjoyed my time there greatly. Excellent service - many of the staff learned my name fairly early on. Outstanding Executive Lounge - food, staff, and happy hour. Excellent fitness facility - 3 treadmills, bike, 2 other cardio, free weights, and several machines. Rooms were comfortable with great beds. Location allowed for easy walking anywhere in downtown. Parking was available at a monthly rate that was much reduced from what the total daily rate would be. All in all, it was the staff, lounge, gym, and location (in that order) that I liked the best. I only had one minor issue my entire time there that was handled very well. (Had a water leak in my room in the middle of the night. I called the front desk, got dressed in my workput clothes and headed to the the gym as it was open 24 hours. The staff visited me in the gym a few times to provide status and had the room ready for me to get ready for work by the time I was done with my workout. I changed rooms after work that day. Entire matter handled very well!)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR58943349">I was truly impressed with this hotel. Staff was tops!!! Very professional.

Rooms are updated including the bathrooms and shower area. Beds, bedding, towels are all great. Room had flat screen TV and a window you could open. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Lobby and lobby bar are partially updated and as a result not the newest but not really old. Had salmon salad in the bar one evening for dinner and it was better than expected. Also a convenient location for printing boarding passes in the lobby. So with all this why an Average rating: The hotel is just a little dark and dated and common areas seem dingy. The conference hall for my meeting had really poor lighting and was also--well just dingy. Fitnees area has windows and was just okay. I was unfortunate enough to be stuck in an room with a common adjoining door with another room. I could hear every word spoken in the adjacent room. So MAKE SURE you do not get a room with a shared inner door. Unless you enjoy having someone else dictate when you are going to sleep. This happened late in my third night at hotel--too late to want to make a change as I had a 4:30am alarm.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR57439197">The hotel is convenient to the convention center through an underground walkway. The room corridor smelled musty, but the room was fine. Although the toilet-tub area was very small, the room itself was fine with all the usual amenities. The robes were an unexpected touch for a hotel at this price point. My biggest complaint would be the lack of lighting-especially in the entry and closet area. Also, the hot water tended to fluctuate. Service staff were very friendly and professional. I recommend the food in the lobby-tasty and reasonably priced.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56531070">The staff at the counter couldn't communicate in English.

The room was what you'd expect from a Hilton; clean, comfortable bed and room, nice decor, a good place for a business trip. The only comment I'd really make about it was that it was hard to find a more casual, less expensive place to dine in the evening when we got back. Though my colleague had rented a car, we really didn't feel like driving around struggling to find the places listed for us and parking once we found them, and the list itself was out of date - three or four places we tried to walk to from it were out of business or closed for the evening. So be prepared to either take a taxi, or eat at the hotel. One nice option we hadn't realized they had - in the the upstairs lobby, they were serving drinks and you could order from the restaurant menu, which included appetizers that were quite reasonable for an actual light meal and quite tasty, too. The restaurant itself had a very nice view - I had breakfast there the third day and it was very good, and not too expensive by hotel breakfast standards.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR53575678">Went back to the Seattle Hilton for one night this week and now I know why I stay elsewhere especially with so many nice Hotels in downtown Seattle.

We made the reservation on the hotel website and got $104/night with AAA discount. Since weâ€™re HH gold member, we got free breakfast in the executive lounge on the top floor. The hotel is not as â€œgrandâ€� as the other Hilton because the hotel lobby is on the 10th floor. When we pull up the hotel address, we didnâ€™t know it was the hotel since there is no obvious hotel entrance. There are 2 small doors on the 1st floor and a bellman is there most of the time. There is also a Alamo/National rental car counter on the 1st floor. You can only park on the street for 10 minutes for loading/unloading. We had to take the elevator to the 10th floor lobby for check in. Our room is on the 20th floor with partial water view. We can see the Red Lion, Sheraton hotels from our room. The room is small but adequate. Itâ€™s been renovated so the bathroom has nice granite countertop. Everything looks new and clean. The heater is noisy so we turn it off at night. The bed is comfortable, the sheets and towels are luxurious. Breakfast on the top floor was good, with a view of the city skyline. We can see the Space Needle from the breakfast room. Staffs are very friendly and knowledgeable. The hotel is at a great location, with luxurious stores on the 1st floor on the same block. Itâ€™s only a short walk to the downtown transit tunnel where you can take the bus or light rail to/from airport. Itâ€™s also a 10 minutes walk one direction to Pike Place or the other direction to the shopping meca with Macyâ€™s, Nordstrom, Westlake mall, etc. This is also where you can take the monorail to the Space Needle. But we walked from the hotel to the Space Needle via the Olympia Sculpture Park. We also walked to the ferry terminal to take the ferry to Bredenton ($7 round trip), a cheap way to cruise the Puget Sound. This hotel is definitely worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR50322113">I am someone who stays as Hilton Hotels nearly 20 times per year. Most are very high quality and great value for cost. The Hilton Seattle Hotel appears to be a bit substandard. First the entrance lobby is very ugly. Second the breakfast dining area on the top floor is gray brown and the breakfast is something like a Hampton Inn. The rooms are very nice. The common areas are the problem confined and gray- brown.

Location was excellent, hotel was in walking distance to many places downtown as well as the monorail to the Space Needle and many bus lines if you're venturing to other neighborhoods. It's also in the 'ride free' zone which means if you're just staying in the downtown area between 6am-7pm, your bus rides are free. I'm sure there are many airport shuttles that can take you here too but if you're on a budget and just have a carry on, you can take regular public transportation buses as well. Room and bathroom were a bit small but not unbearably so. Decor wasn't bad but not super modern either, could use a facelift in the near future. Everything was clean and air conditioning worked well (which was a necessity because I ended up there at the beginning of the 100+ degree heatwave!) Staff was very pleasant and helpful - when I checked in, the woman at the desk complimented my shirt. Another time I walked outside the hotel and stood there for a few moments with a map in my hand trying to figure out which way I needed to go and an employee from the desk actually came outside and asked me if I needed help with directions. I also had a problem with being double charged for my stay, which I wasn't aware of until I got home and saw it on my statement, but I called the hotel and left a message explaining the problem and within 15 minutes I received a call back apologizing for what happened and the double charge had been refunded.

I hestitated to choose the Hilton after reading the reviews on this site, but our experience was so good that it has prompted me to write a review for the first time. The staff could not have been more helpful, starting with the warm greeting at the reception desk. We were both upgraded to executive floors, and found the rooms to be clean, ample and comfortable. The full complimentary breakfast was one of the best I have found in any U.S. hotel: a full buffet, with the option to order an omelet as well, and the serving staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. I would certainly stay at the Hilton again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR46638065">The winning point for the Hilton is its location! You can walk to Pikes Market or get a busâ€¦.. Walk to get the monorail in the direction of Macyâ€™s. You can also walk over to the Sheraton( beautiful hotel) and book a Grayline tour or check with the concierge on the Lobby level.. Shopping is close by. From the airport you can get to the Hilton Hotel using the Airporter which can be picked up at the end of baggage, This bus stops and picks up at the Hilton Hotel round trip is $18.00 per person. A few negativesâ€¦the hotel rooms are small. The bathroom is too small. I did not like the toilet in with the shower behind a closed door. The lighting in the bathroom is to dim.( I know conservation). The walls are a bit thin. The TV seemed to be programmed not to go too loud. For a Hilton Rooms are bland and dull! Breakfast on the Top floor is average and over-priced. You can get a quick meal at Fergieâ€™s next door. On a bright side, the room was clean with large flat screen TV, it is clear the rooms have been graded a bit, bed comfortable the staff friendly and helpful. This is Business Hotel with little character. Car Rental Desk located in the hotel great for renting car for a day and return. Toursâ€¦I would recommend the Duck Tour for children and adults, it is just simply fun! Cost $25.00 per person but must pick up at the Space Needle.( take the Monorail cost $2.00 per person with Senior and Children discounts) Pikes Market is fun and interesting.( there is Pikes Market Tour) We did not take , but wondered around on our own. Boeing Tour is great for learning about how planes are put together. Everert(Boeing Factory) is located about 30 miles outside of Seattle. Tours are between $48- $56 depending on Tour Company.

Supposedly the taxi fare is $32 from the airport (as adverstised on the cab window), but none of my colleagues or I got that rate. Something about extra taxes due to the airport. Our fares all ranged from $38-45. The bellman at the Hilton were all very welcoming and friendly and the front desk was nice enough. I checked in at noon, well ahead of the 3pm check in time. The room was clean and fairly up-to-date. The downside was that the bathroom was very tiny. It was quite awkward getting in and out of the bathroom to close the door. Also, the hangers for the closet had the tiny hooks so they couldn't be used on a normal clothes rod in order to help combat theft. As a result of this, you couldn't hang your clothes just anywhere. The only place besides the closet was a tiny hook on the back of the bathroom door. This became quite annoying very quickly when getting ready. On my last night there, it was after 10 pm at night and I heard the sink make a funny gurgling noise. When I looked in there, it was full of brownish black water. I called the front desk and someone came up and had it fixed within half an hour. I don't know if this was an ongoing problem as my neighbor had the same problem that night, but the response was quick and was taken care of quickly. The location of this hotel can't be beat. We were two blocks away from the convention center, and about 5-6 blocks from Pike's Street Market. I walked down there 3 times during my stay. The walk down is all downhill, and the walk back can be quite a challenge depending on which way you come back. If you walk down University street (which the Hilton sits on), it will take you straight to Pier 57 where you'll find many restaurants. We ate at the Crab Pot one night where they have a crab boil and dump all the goods on the table for you to break open with a mallet. Coming back up the stairs and hill after a full dinner was a real challenge! But fun nonetheless! Overall, this was a decent stay at a decent hotel. Not the best...but not the worst.

I can now honestly say I do not intend to stay here again. In a nutshell, the level of service here stinks...badly. Here's a rundown of failings of this place (as experienced by us on the last trip) - Lineup of no less than 5 parties at checkin - with one person manning the counter - despite this being at a busy time ~3pm, and with no apology for the wait. - Very snarly front desk staff. Upon informing him that we had 2 reservations (for consecutive nights...one with points, the other at a pre-paid rate) he reacted with serious attitude, as if I was inconveniencing him and that it was MY fault the reservations weren't "joined together" in the system. He then informed me that our room key "probably" wouldn't work on the second day of our stay - which, as it turned out, it didn't. (My opinion - this is a 'technical' issue that front desk should be able to deal with very easily, without me having to be inconvenienced by returning to the front desk to obtain a new key) - In previous stays using Hilton points I was offered comp. upgrade to 'executive' floor - not this time (despite the hotel clearly not being full). - Cleanliness of room was NOT up to standard - hair in bathtub and bathroom floor, for example. - Unusual (and cramped) layout of bathroom. - Lobby bar staff were unattentive, despite there being only 3 other people in it at the time. Furthermore, we had to listen to her complaining loudly to another patron about how long she had been on duty. Food was dropped on our table with nary a word. - Finally, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the fire alarm going off at 7:15 Subday morning, and continuing for ~30min (staff did instruct people via the PA system to remain in their rooms). Upon checkout later that morning I inquired as to the problem, with no real answer, other than "something went wrong" (duh!) - nor any apology whatsoever, nor any inquiry about whether our stay was satisfactory, etc. My (and I assume MOST people's) typical guage on the level of service at a hotel is the willingness of staff to take care of the small things that might otherwise cause you irritation or inconvenience, staff's expression of appreciation for your patronage and their general level of courtesy and pleasantness. From my experience, the Hilton Seattle is seriously lacking in those respects. Next time we will probably choose the Sheraton - its one block away and was a much more pleasant place the previous time we stayed there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37770098">An interesting hotel, the lobby is on the 13th floor, the bottom 12 floors being a car park / offices.

Surly staff overall, didn't have a "can do" attitude, worst of all I was hit with a credit card charge when I returned home for services I didn't use. I was not impressed.

We had a nice, very clean room and ours had a decent view (see picture). We stayed on the executive/club level and having been in a lot of Hilton's, this one has one of the best club lounges in the business. The lounge is on the top floor and in the morning doubles as a breakfast restaurant. It's views are outstanding, the evening bar service is great and it also has free wifi for your laptop. All of the staff I encountered were great and helpful. Now the weak points. It's downtown location is great for conventioners but a bit of walking for the tourist crowd. Also if you drive in with you own car you have to park in their garage, no valet parking, and the garage is more expensive than most valet lots you'd run into. Also you either have to check in, and then ask for a bellman to come back to the garage with you, or haul all your own luggage in yourself. We had a fair amount so I went and got a bellman who was very courtous and helpful, but it did mean a fairly long time between arriving and being settled in the room. Still, considering everything including the staff I would choose this hotel on a return trip to Seattle. Unless someone else was paying, then I'd try the Four Seasons which is just a couple blocks away and looked great.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR33954785">We liked the location as we had a car ($28 a night for parking) as it was only one block from the freeway so we didn't have to negotiate many streets.

We booked an executive room &amp; had to return to check in to make sure it was actualy an executive room as it was so small, also very noisy right beside the lifts. After one night we asked to be moved &amp; got a much nicer room. The Executive lounge was really just the restaurant. After it closed at 2pm it then became the lounge.There was no complimentary breakfast for Exec room guests, so we considered the rate poor value for money.

The location is fine, however the hotel is somewhat average. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It seems like it is in that 30-50 year old range where it's not yet a classic old hotel, but it is too old to be remolded or updated for contemporary style. The staff was very nice and the lobby was pretty cool, but as with all older hotels all of the money is in the lobby and the rooms are small and uninspiring. The diamond room is the combination of two old hotel rooms and is average. The staff was very helpful, but the facility itself felt cold. My wife described it as a state office building- like it was full of people without souls. The hotel was a good value. I think we only paid $105/night- however parking was $20/night.

They moved me to another room in time for my Webinar and sent me a fruit/snack basket with apologies (and didn't charge for the Internet). They really took care of the problem the best ways possible! There is free wireless Internet in the lobby, along with a pay per use business center. The hotel is on the periphery of downtown, but is accessible, especially with the free downtown transit zone. If you are determined to stay at a Hilton, you should like this place. I also recommend you consider the Homewood Suites - Convention Center/Pike Street (see separate review).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21154885">This hotel was in a convenient location in downtown Seattle, but I wasn't a fan of the set-up. I know there's not much to be done about it now, but I don't think I would choose this property again- especially for the price. First of all, you enter a rather empty area on the ground level. There was nowhere for the taxi to pull into and no awning to keep rain off. There was no doorman. Just a door at the corner of the building. You have to get on the elevators to get to the lobby and that really wasn't marked well. There's a ramp that leads to parking and a cardio center, but I don't know if I would have even noticed the elevators right away if somebody hadn't gotten off of one of them. The lobby is about 14 stories up over the parking area (I'm guessing at the amount of floors). Reception was efficient if not overly friendly. I know this sounds corny, but I kind of like the "oh you're a Diamond member, welcome back" spiel that I get at other Hilton properties. They did not even acknowledge that I had even stayed at a Hilton before. I really don't think they could have cared less that I was a paying guest at the time. My room was on a mid level floor and the hallway felt very cramped to me. The fixtures were older and the room itself was very, very tiny. I've actually had bigger rooms in prime areas in New York City. I ate in the restaurant at the top of the hotel. The dirty martini was excellent. The prime rib was not so great. The employee in reception did ask me if I wanted the key to the mini bar when I checked in, but forgot to give it to me. When I went back to the front desk to retrieve it, the response was "oh-here". I looked around for area information in the lobby and nobody offered any assistance. It just seemed like the employees did not like working there at all. Then again, it was a Saturday night and they were at work. My main concern was the small room size- even the bathroom was super tiny. If you have more than one person traveling and need a little space you may want to look elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20065921">The Hilton Seattle is located a block away from the Sheraton where all the action downtown begins - by action, I mean, shops and restaurants and everything else. This location puts its guests close enough to everything yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of a busy pedestrian area. Granted it is an older property, much older from the outside when compared to other hotels, such as the Sheraton but the rooms and the service provided is sufficient enough to make up for the age. Rooms have been renovated and while it is nothing too out of the ordinary, it is comfortable (albeit, the rooms, and especially the bathrooms are pretty small). Being another Hilton, one can come to expect reliability! The Downtown Airporter bus stops at this hotel (they only stop at a few select hotels) so that's another added bonus - there is no need to transfer to another bus to get to your hotel! All in all, a solid choice in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19731055">I like this place but they need more people, the pool is great and you can see the Boeing Company from your window.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19320703">Stayed at the Seattle Hilton for one night. We were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary and were not dissappointed. We parked in the Hilton garage and took the elevator to the 14th floor (lobby) to check in. The area was very nice with an attractive lobby bar. After a short wait (2 min. or less) we were greeted in a friendly manner and checked into our room without incident. I had pre-ordered some amenities to be in our room (flowers etc.) and when we got to our room they were there as requested. The room was on the Executive level (28th floor) and had a nice view of Elliott Bay (looking toward the northwest). The room was clean and the bed very comfortable. As some prior reviewers mentioned the room itself was small but not uncomfortable. We had no complaints. As others have mentioned the executive lounge was very small but the view was nice and the attendant was very friendly. This was the only below average experience we had. All staff were very accommodating and the location of the hotel was convenient to shopping and Pikes Place market (a walk of about 1/4 mile). All-in-all we would stay here again when in Seattle. Don't believe the negative reviews. The Seattle Hilton is a nice hotel in a very good location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18043256">We arrive late at night, to find hotel had been oversold and they didn't have a room for us (despite guaranteed late arrival with credit card). They tried to put us in nearby hotels -- but none were available. So after screwing around for about an hour, they put us in a function room with fold-out bed. They assured me the next day they would move our luggage to a bedroom. But when we came back after a day of enjoying the city, and went to front desk as instructed, the clerk had no idea where our room or luggage had been located. After calling around and banging on the computer for awhile, they found a room -- and had the bellhop find our luggage and move it there. But when we got there, room was not available, so they put us in yet a third room. Screw-ups, screw-ups, screw-ups. When all finally settled, the room was extremely small. I stay in New York city regularly, and this room was even small compared to New York rooms. There were several other screw-ups during our stay. A bellhop told me he was trying hard to find a job at another hotel in town that is better run. This hotel needs better management.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17005897">Nicely in walking distance of convention center and, if you're active, the monorail and waterfront.

I was apprehensive about the stay given negative reviews from other travellers. We had a very positive experience during our stay - although we did not use either the exercise facility or the business features. As per another's suggestion we requested an upper floor room with a view of Puget Sound. This was quite pleasant. The room was clean and quiet, although a little on the small side. The bathroom amenities were quite nice. We ordered room service during the stay, and the food was excellent and arrived as ordered. Additonally, the lobby bar was pleasant and understated. I'm not sure this hotel would be a good value at full rate, but discounted for the conference it served quite nicely.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15333050">I'm trying to keep my review within guidelines, because I feel it's important for people to know the kinds of business practices we ran into. We stayed at the Hilton for two nights, on the second night we were having our wedding reception at the top of the Hilton. All the booking went smoothly, the room was decent (exectutive sweet) and not overpriced, since we got a discount for having our reception there. The problems arrived later during our reception, and here is a short summary of things that happened. -Elevators were having issues off and on throughout the night. -Myself and several others from the reception were stuck in the lobby, and couldn't get back up to the reception due to elevators not working, and the key card we were given not working to go back up -The DJ closing the party early since only a few were at the party (no one could get back up) -Hilton Staff locking up the room, and not allowing us entrance to gather our belongs, or use the reception room for the additional hour and a half is was booked for by contract -A Hilton staff member challenging me to a fist fight, telling me to hit him, after I got aggravated and insisted he let us back up. -Having the head of security apologize for the actions of said staff member. -Finally getting back to the executive suite at least, to stay the rest of the night. -Having the police show up, because my wife assaulted the Hilton staff member who tried to fight me, be putting a hand on him and getting between the two of us, even after security had apologized to us. -After the police left, from hearing our story, an hour later (so long because the elevators were broken again) the night manager and security officer showed up to kick us out, for above mentioned assault, and we should be glad an arrest wasn't made. -After threatening to get lawyers involved for the breach of contract, being told we can stay. -Getting a call 15 minutes later from the night manager to apologize to me, and being told that we would work out some sort of discount for our trouble. -Waking up in the morning finding that we were double charged for the room, and parking for vehicles that were not ours. -Dealing with people that were at first nice, saying they would work on getting charges reversed and would call us right back. -Finding out that the Hilton made additional charges not outlined in the contract without consent -Being told that they're only willing to reverse a small portion of the charges, because the staff there says our story is false. So in the end, they breached our contract, and refused to credit us back for it. Not sure if we'll take any further action because we're already burned out from the abuse we received.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15083315">This is the absolute worst Hilton that I have ever stayed in. We are Gold HH members, travel a lot, and this is the absolute worst Hilton in the world. We were on the last leg of a two week vacation with our 10 year old daughter that took us to Hilton properties in South Lake Tahoe CA all the way to Whistler BC. I would rate the other Hiltons as "Excellent" First of all they charge you $9.95 a night to use the internet in your room. The free wireless internet is only available in the Executive Lounge (small converted guest room) or in the lobby. We went up to the Executive Lounge and it was comical. There were business people packed elbow to elbow on their laptops using the "free" internet eating and drinking their "free" food. What a sight! I'm sure that they could de-congest the Executive Lounge if they didn't charge for the internet! We stayed on a Hilton Honors floor, but noticed that dirty dishes and newspapers in the hall weren't picked up for the three days that we were there. The excercise room is about the size of a walk in closet and they have two treadmills and a stepper jammed in there. The only people who provided any sort of customer service were the Bellmen. Front desk personnel and management that I delt with have no customer service skills. My car was parked in the Hilton garage and my window was smashed out and my car was ransacked. Hilton Security simply left a business card on my smashed window and took the time to sweep the glass off of the ground. I discovered that Hilton Security knew that my car was broken into and let it sit there with a smashed out window for over two days! Did they notify me? NO! After a series of failures by Hilton staff I was put in touch with Seattle Hilton's Director of Security. I asked him why I wasn't notified that my car had been broken into. His response "It is not our policy" and "it's not in the parking manual". Hilton Honors stated that the GM would contact me on Monday. Well here it is Wednesday and no response. I finally drafted a lenghty letter to Hilton Corporate HQ regarding the Seattle Hilton.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14970268">Stayed here April 7 - 11. Attended a conference held in the hotel. This property is in a great location in downtown Seattle, in easy walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Pacific Place shopping, the Convention Center, and the monorail to the Space Needle. It is an older property, but the only way to guess that is due to the slightly smaller bedroom and bathroom sizes, along with the narrow corridors on the floor levels, along with the small number of rooms on each floor. All walls, tiles, linens and furnishings were clean and modern, presenting a nice decor. Bathrooms were equipped with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Le Source toiletries (my favorite!). Rooms start on floor 14 (which I was on) and run through floor 28, with the restaurant on the 29th floor. Three elevators provided smooth and speedy service. Another plus - to access any guest floor, and room key was required, helping make a single traveler feel safe. The meeting rooms were spacious and the hotel staff kept refreshments aplenty. Breakfast and lunch each day in the restaurant was an unexpected gourmet treat - much more elegant than normally required for informal meals. The restaurant had a spectacular view of Puget Sound and when the sky was clear, the Olympic Mountains. The view was easily seen from any seating area. The bar area also had a menu but I didn't eat there - but the bar was large with a cozy decor. The concierge was friendly and helpful. One night she made a reservation for me at Cutter's Restaurant, making sure the restaurant would provide me complimentary transportation for my return to the hotel. At the restaurant, I was given an appetizer, courtesy of the concierge. Also, I needed a 4:15am town car pick up for the airport my last day and the concierge booked me with a company, saving me $15 off the most affordable transportation I found on my own on the internet. My only disappointment was the business center - very small and a $6 fee for use. Most hotels now offer this as a complimentary service. Maybe the Seattle Hilton will change this soon. Thanks for a great four nights, I slept very well!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR12715369">I stayed here for 1 night and am HH Gold. Not sure why people complain about check-in not being ground level as there are many examples of international hotels with a similar configuration. IMO, not something to really gripe about. I actually welcome it as it means the floors start at a higher level thus further removing you from street noise. Upon walking to the ground floor entrance, the bellman was extremely pleasant and asked if it was my first time. While waiting for the elevator, he carefully explained the hotel amenities and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I was a little early for check-in and my room wasn't ready. No problem. I left my bags with the concierge and went looking for lunch. Upon returning, my room was ready and was given a room on the 25th floor. I noticed they called this floor the HH floor. The room itself was a decent size. The furniture is newish and there is a flat screen tv, although I consider this "de rigeur" for the HIlton chain. I did think the comforter was a little on the thin side, but did the job. There is an in-room safe and an electric thermostat. Some of the hangers looked a little derelict but did the job. The washroom sink is separated from the toilet and bath. Both areas are quite small. One thing I did note is that the shower had excellent water pressure. As a HH Gold, I was allowed access to the 28th floor executive lounge and received a coupon for a free buffet breakfast on the top floor restaurant. There were some passes to places such as Gold's gym but I can't remember the other ones. The lounge had h'ors d'oeurves from 5-7 pm. I walked in and noted there was a single hot steamer (didn't look inside) with a decent selection of veggies. I think there was an alcohol selection. Didn't stay as I had other dinner plans. Next morning, went to the top floor restaurant for breakfast. The buffet was not the most plentiful I've seen but decently stocked. There were the standard bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast, pastries, fruit, etc. A feature I like about all Hiltons is that you can ask for made-to-order eggs as part of the buffet. I ordered an omelette and what came back was a HUGE omelette that was very good. I've had omelettes in plenty of hotels before and can vouch that this thing was big. Check-out was smooth. The whole time during my stay, there were reminders that "I would be getting a survey and if I couldn't rate the hotel a 10, they encouraged me to call someone about it". Considering the Hilton is NOT a 5 star hotel (I think 4 star), it met expectations. The staff certainly did try and tried hard. I would stay here again, provided the price is right. I'm giving it 4.5 stars (but TripAdvisor won't allow that) because the HVAC was a little loud and the smallish bathroom size. The staff service is definitely 5 star.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11214708">Recently stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. No major complaints. The set up is a little odd what with having to take an elevator to the lobby from street level but nothing to stress over. Check in was smooth. We were given a room on the 23rd floor. It was just right the right size for myself and my boyfriend. Apparently this hotel has been recently renovated. It shows. The furniture in our room was in pristine condition and the widescreen LG tv's are great. The beds and bedding are also top notch. The one complaint I would have about the room would be that the bathroom area is on the small side. It is definately a one person sized area. You have to take turns getting ready. Also something that might be and issue for light sleepers who plan on sleeping in is that the hotel walls are on the thin side. Sound travels here. We woke early on both mornings to go out and could hear housekeeping knocking on doors loud and clear. I thought they were knocking on the door of the room next to ours but when I peeked out they were at least 5 doors down. We were given access to the concierge lounge on the 28th floor. It is a converted guest room and as such is not particularly spacious. The gentleman up there serving drinks is great for any kind of questions you may have about where to dine, what to see, etc. He recommended a fantastic restaurant to us and made us reservations as well. I can honestly say it was one of my top five dining experiences ever. I did not dine in the hotel restaurant or use the fitness room so I have no comment on those areas. There is a lobby bar which is fairly spacious but I never saw more than 5 guests in there at once. Not a super busy place. One final comment I would like to throw in about this hotel is that the staff we came across were all pleasant. I find this to be one of the things I judge an experience by the most. Its kind of like going to a restaurant and having wonderful food and horrid service. The food could be the best ever and you probably wouldn't go back because the service sucked. All of the service personnel we came across were friendly and courteous. Particularily the concierge in the concierge lounge. They made our stay most pleasant. I will definately be back to this hotel<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11096098">I have just stayed in the Seattle Hilton for 4 nights and apart from a couple of minor issues I found it to be excellent. The concierge at the front desk was very helpful. Check in is on a different floor but there was no hassle going up there, and it was extremely fast. The rooms were very clean with large, comfortable beds and nice views, if not spectacular, and the flat screen tv is really excellent with a wide rage of channels. The bathroom is small and has a strange layout but overall it was ok. There is lots of storage space to put things. They serve a nice, and not completely overpriced, breakfast which also had fast service. I did not eat a main meal in the hotel but it is close to a lot of restaurants and two blocks away from the major shopping area. The only issue that I had with the hotel was the bathroom. The plug in the bath did not work making it impossible to take a bath if you wanted as the water just drained away.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11073921">I've never stayed in such a small room before in my life and for the price you would think it would have been much larger. The bathroom amenities are nice, I just wished the bathroom would have been large enough for 2 people to stand in it at one time. The room is so small that 2 people can't walk between the beds and the tv at the same time. Did I mention the beds? For the price you pay you would think the beds would be much more comfortable, but they aren't! I just really don't have any positive reviews on the room, except nice bathroom amenties (if you like Crabtree and Evelyn). Even the towels weren' t that soft... Sure, the hotel is convenient to shopping and sure the bartender in the lobby (Bob) is one of the best by far, but to park in their garage you have to pay $26/night. I wasn't that impressed with the restaurant either, you will get much better drinks in the lobby bar (Bob is the bartender there). The drinks are expensive though, so you might want to drink elsewhere. The staff was nice enough, but they didn't even offer or ask if we wanted a mini-bar key. I had to go back down to get one and that was after a lady came by the room to check our mini bar. Did I mention that she "softly" knocked and then proceeded to walk in our room and we were not "prepared" for company at that moment! My husband was furious and wanted to tell the front desk about it, but I told him to just blow it off. For the money, I do NOT recommend this hotel. I think there must be much larger rooms in a hotel downtown somewhere and they surely must be nice rooms for that price. I know we will continue to search for that hotel and keep you informed when we find one.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8724570">Easy to find, easy and safe to park, check-in is on the 16th floor (a bit perplexing).

We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way. The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect. Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite. On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful. He put together a dinner at Salty's that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids.

The room was larger than expected, well-furnished, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The parking garage and elevator system were convenient and fast. I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgable of hotel ammenties and the city (what not to miss in 2 days!). We were directed toward the Brooklyn restaurant for our first dinner in the city -- good choice. The Top of the Hilton was wonderful for nightcaps and breakfast - great view.

The building is old and outdated, the parking garage is a pain, the workout room a joke, service is lacking, staff are unskilled in their jobs, and nobody really seems to care. For example parking seemed to be handled differently every time I checked in, with the result that nearly every time I left the garage I had to go through the process of explaining that I was staying at the hotel and wait for someone to figure out if I had paid for parking. Billing errors occurred more than once, including a charge that showed up a week after I checked out. The most galling however was the total disinterest in making a frequent customer happy â€“ the rooms I was given included some needing repair, some with spectacular views of a wall and puddles on a roof, two with barely functioning air conditioners, and a room designed for handicapped access that can best be described as barely functional â€“ and they never gave me a room on, or access to, the executive floor.

The decor in the rooms are very outdated. The bed was comfortable, but the shower and all other furnishings were not good. It was just a depressing room all around. It is in a good location.

The free breakfast is great, as there is a large selection, including hot food (and waffles you can make fresh yourself) and it tasted good.

As soon as I walked in the ambiance was like home, a great room so warm and friendly just like their staff. All the amenaties (hot tub and pool were delightful). The marble bathroom was an exceptional change, the bedding was classic comfort and the pillows were to die for, my bro. asked me if I could find him a few of those. They say they are still in renovation mode, I can't imagine it getting any better! The price with the discount was a huge plus as we had to travel so far to get there and back, even without a discount it's a killer deal, measures up to any 5 star hotel I've ever been in and they have even more luxurious suites than the simple Dbl. bed we chose, Those prices are the best I have seen in Seattle for such comfort, do check out the virtual tour, I had no idea they offered that online as I was in a hurry to find a place, last minute. I got home, clicked on the virtual tour and it is EXACTLY WHAT YOU VIEW on the tour, no phoney trick to get you there, you get what you see and much more. Don't pass this place by, you will miss out on a great experience. Nice job Cody and staff, you are now my and all my friends &amp;families go to place when we want or need to be in Seattle!! (we even had the space needle as our view OMG, breathtaking at night). The entire staff was amazing, really!!! You will never regret booking with this hotel, I assure you. I just learned, my cousin from California has booked with them the last 2 yrs. for a week at a time and she agrees with everything I have written, she's sorry she didn't do it herself. Looking forward to our next visit, thanks so much John St. Suites, it was a delightful time just hanging around.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124975993">I liked this place a lot. The hotel seemed very nice and the staff were quite friendly. This hotel is great value for money when you consider the location and the facilities. The pool was very nice, if a bit crowded. The breakfast was excellent with hot/cold selection. Our room was a little small but nice. Overall, location was excellent. I think it would be hard to find a better location for the price paid. It was crowded over Presidents Day weekend but that speaks volumes about how affordable the hotel is. Shuttle service was good. Staff seemed quite nice.

Booking.com assisted to arrange a room closer to the event and Quality Inn was suppose to pay the difference of the late reservation to a hotel close to the Seattle Center. After the event I submitted the proper paperwork to Quality Inn for reimbursement. THe Hotel would not respond to multiple emails and phone calls. Booking.com has tried to assist but it has been six weeks since I submitted the paperwork to Quality Inn and they will not even return a phone call.

John, the manager that morning was so nice to help us, he arranged for a rental car and gave us directions and comments on our desired plans. Jennifer was very professional and helpful also.

Breakfast was excellent. And we had covered parking. Also, a guest laundry was valuable to us and not available in many motels.

We never had trouble getting a place to park, the room was always clean, coffee was always available in the lobby, and the breakfast was great. We ran the A/C to drown the traffic noise but even that was alright cause I liked the "white noise". The staff was always very nice and friendly. I had read a few poor reviews but took the chance anyway. I'm glad there is moderately priced, clean, adequate places like this to stay at, in a great central location when you want to vacation but are on a tight budget.

I would say its good if you get a fantastic rate otherwise I would look elsewhere. We checked in late and turns out we were given the wrong room, which was much smaller and not renovated as nicely. We understand that often happens with hotels when you check in late. Next day we asked and said we were being transfered to another room right away. Housekeeping was still in there just finishing making it up which was fine. We transfered our belongings and left for the day. When we returned at about 8pm we found that our new key cards would not work. We went to front desk to inquire and there was no front desk person. The office was locked, the side door was wide open. There were people waiting to check in. We hunted everywhere for someone. Finally someone arrived after about 10 minutes. This is unacceptable. Even if he had to step away for an emergency he should have left a note. Almost every time we needed to deal with front desk either they were short staff or no one was there. There was another occaision we were down in the lobby and the desk person was no where to be found. the first room itself was terrible and very stuffy. the second room was much better, decorated nicer and more represenatiative of what we had booked but the beds in both rooms were not very comfortable and the air very stuffy. the pros: the location, the price if you get a great rate, the cons: service, the rooms<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118407572">We stayed here for 1 night prior to an Alaskan cruise. I'm satisfied with our choice because we got a decent rate. Granted the hotel is older and showing some wear, as does the room, but the room was good sized, clean and quiet, with a refrigerator. We faced the street, but didn't hear any noise at night. There didn't seem to be much traffic here at night. This area does have several other hotels, including a Holiday Inn across the street. The hotel is 2 blocks from the Space Needle, which we visited prior to the cruise. There didn't seem to be many restaurant choices in the immediate area; I believe there was an Italian one within a couple blocks, but not much else except a McDonald's. Didn't want to do too much walking at night, as the area was pretty deserted on a Friday night. The hotel breakfast is very good, with a lot of choices, even bacon. If the room is crowded, an adjoining conference room can be used, so space was not an issue. We took the hotel's $6pp shuttle to the cruise pier, which is about a mile away. This worked well as it was efficient and on time. This was a good reasonably priced chocie for a pre/post cruise stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118168614">We arrived late in the evening.

Even the smaller room provided the comfy bed and hot shower! Staff were friendly, courteous, helpful and accommodating. Parking is an issue but they do have limited parking. Early arrival probably helps. We never got into our car after arrival. Great breakfasts provided also. Best part is location. 2 blocks from Space Needle, Music Experience and Monorail. Restuarants, bars in area. Monorail will get you downtown where you can easily walk to Pike's Market and Harbor area. You can also walk down Broad St., which is near, down to Harbor area.

I chose not tonfor a number of reasons. I was amazed bynthe quality of the staff at all levels. They were consisitently kind and professional, and for my specific need, compassionate. And although I tried to minimize my requests, the few that I had were met with concern, ambition and dedication. I got to know my new friends on a personal basis and there are far too many to mention here. Many staff went above and beyond in meeting my needs. Now for the location, the only word being ideal for so many things. Surrounding neighborhoods are safe and surprisingly artistic. Daily Walks, or in my case wheeling in a wheelchair, were very enjoyable. People need to be aware that while the shuttle is there for your convenience, it is also important to know that the drivers have cruise ship obligations amongst others, so it is necessary to always be prepared to take a cab. They can almost always accommodate you with at least a days notice. Rooms were exceptionally comfortable and if anything was lacking, it was only a friendly phone call away. I would have preferred an ice machine on every floor, but this was only because I was unable to use the stairs and had to wait for a sometimes busy elevator. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff...all of whom should be commended, maybe in the form of a raise :).

It was a great location. The hotel offers a free shuttle (you just pay the driver a tip) to take you around if it is available. We had them take us to Pike's Market and then to the Pier. They will also pick you up and drop you off at the airport for $10 per person. Taking you and picking you up from the cruise ship is $6 per person. What a bargain! The hotel room had a comfy king size bed and a huge handicapped bathroom. Supposedly Elvis stayed there and filmed some location shots at the pool. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the Space Needle and there are several restaurants by the Space Needle area. If you want to ride the Ducks around Seattle, that is even closer to the hotel. The hot tub was broken when we were there so I didn't bother to use the pool. The breakfast was lots of carbs - but pretty decent and a bit better than a lot of the free breakfasts offered. And if you are driving or have a rental car - FREE parking! That's huge in Seattle where most hotels, you have to pay to park. The staff was pretty nice and the drivers were great. We got there early and so we checked our luggage and went sightseeing. There is a computer with internet in the lobby also if you need to check in with your airlines, etc. They also have restaurant menus at the desk which was helpful when we were looking for someplace to dine. I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117056152">I read the reviews of this hotel carefully. I realized full well what type of lodging it was. I did not want to pay for a four star hotel in Seattle. Priceline rates were going for way more than I was willing to pay. I decided to give this place a try and I was not disappointed at all. We found the check in staff very friendly and efficienct, although they didn't seem that familiar with the area and couldn't answer several of our questions. Our room and bathroom were very basic, but VERY clean. The room did have a cleaning solution odor, which bothered me a little. I do have asthma and was worried it would be triggered by the smell. However, we ran the fan so it drew in outdoor air, and it turned out to be just fine. I also left a note for housekeeping to please not use any deodorizing sprays for day 2. The odor decreased significantly. Breakfast was typically 2-3 star hotel breakfast. Nothing to write home about, but adequate to start your day. We were most grateful for the free parking. We thought the location was perfect. We ate at several local restaurants that were frequented by the locals. It was not a far walk to downtown. We liked that it was much quieter around than the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again. However, as mentioned by another reviewer, you have high standards for your lodging and like 4 star hotels, this is probably not the place for you. If, however, you are just looking for a friendly hotel with a clean room and free parking, you will likely be satisfied.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117006965">This hotel is located just two blocks from Seattle Center and the Space Needle. It is close to the Belltown area where there are tons on restaurants. The hotel fronts Aurora Ave which is a very busy divided highway (no turn arounds). The location is prime for just about anything you want to do in Seattle and the prices are uaually some of the best around. It has free internet and free parking (rare for downtown Seattle). The free breakfast is the standard fare with all the craziness attached. The hotel has lots of tourists and can be very busy, although the staff at the front counter are very friendly and check in is quick. The downside is the hotel itself is pretty old and while very clean is outdated. The styling is probably 80's at best and has a few rough spots. In short if you are looking for a great location and good price, and you will be using the hotel just to sleep, it is probably just fine. If you prefer a little nicer style of accomodations then this place is probably not for you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116699035">Many hotels in the Seattle Center area are very pricey, but this Quality Inn was reasonable.

It is also very close to the Space Needle. You need to walk about 20-30 min to get to the City Centre. The building is fairly old. The registration counter and first floor has probably been renovated but the rooms are not. The room was pretty small and it was mostly clean. Our toilet bowl had a layer of grime so it could definitely use a scrubbing. There were a decent number of hand and bath towels available to us. The biggest complaint was the air conditioning. It is extremely noisy. I had to wear ear plugs during the night. We had to leave the AC on because it was so stuffy. The decent was decent. There were scrambled eggs, sausages and waffles. I have been to several Quality Inns before and there were no sausages. The hallways do smell a bit and feels rather dingy. The big plus of this hotel is the free parking.

Their check in time is 3pm, earlier than most Seattle hotels. The in room jetted tubs at Quality Inn are far superior to the single person bath tubs with weak jets found in most hotels. It's basically like a small hot tub and it isn't in the bathroom, it's across from the bed. Ours had chocolates and roses on it when we walked in, but a man immediately showed up and took them as they were apparently not intended for our room. The continental breakfast is pretty decent, with the waffles you make yourself and various hot food options. The pool is large, very heavily chlorinated and insanely popular with small children. You also have to walk through it occasionally to get to the lobby, which is odd. They let us check out at 3pm and returned our entire deposit... they even held our luggage for a few hours with no issues. Overall, excellent value and by far the best jacuzzi tubs in the city. They also have this huge suite that takes up a whole floor, is pretty reasonably priced and great for parties.

It's on first come first serve basis. That's fine but if so, shouldn't the hotel put that in their ad.

Not sure how that is calculated but we didn't get the same rate, but still an okay value. They offered a free shuttle to hospital but anywhere else was about 10-15 bucks for a few blocks or to go to a Mariners game or to one of the popular piers. Located down town and just a few blocks from the Space Needle. A few more blocks to major attractions downtown. The ladies that checked us into the hotel were friendly and gave some good information about hotel and it's resources. The morning managers on the other hand were, not quite rude, but frustrating in trying to get them to give information such as shuttle times, wake up calls and checking out. The room is super small. The dresser drawers couldn't open all the way because the queen bed was occupying the same space. Found a random earring on the dresser. Uses deodorizers so if you're sensitive to extra fragrances it might be difficult but otherwise it was pleasant and not overly perfumey.

The morning breakfast is noticeably superior to the standard fare. The hotel is located near the Space Needle and the monorail provides very good access to the heart of downtown. The hotel is located in a good neighborhood with several other hotels nearby. I should note that the I think that I received a complimentary room upgrades. I doubt if the standard rooms are huge including a Jacuzzi. However, if I were assigned a standard I still would have been a happy customer. Finally, I found the price to be reasonable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR101552163">This was my first vacation alone so I was a little apprehensive that the hotel wouldn't be everything I hoped it would. All my worries were for nothing however, as I was greeted by a very comfortable hotel. I got the lowest rate room, a room with a single queen, and for me it was perfect. The room was meticulously clean and smelled great, everything was in good condition, and I was impressed by the view of the city I had. PROS: Clean rooms, great service, good prices, within walking distance of just about everything (and if it isn't in walking distance you can hop a bus and get there), lots of restaurant choices, comfortable bed, beautiful pool/hot tub area, FREE PARKING!, and extremely knowledgeable staff. CONS: The breakfast was pretty unimpressive so I slept in and ate out instead, there were still renovations being done and the elevators (which were being renovated) were scary as heck. If you go while they are still renovating, I would suggest taking the stairs. The TV in my room was outdated and had a bluish tint (but I didn't mind because I wasn't there to watch television). I thought there would be a microwave/fridge in my room but it turns out those are only for the double and king rooms which was disappointing but I just used the cooler I'd brought. Finally, the internet was really touchy. I couldn't get it to work until late the first night, and then it was over-all okay but would lag down and sometimes not work altogether at times throughout the trip. Over-all it was a great stay and I'd gladly stay again. I got a fantastic rate, especially considering their free parking offer is unmatched by any other hotel in the area. Everything was comfortable and clean, and this hotel room was perfect for me because I was there to explore the city and really used my hotel room for sleeping and relaxing. I'd absolutely recommend this hotel to a friend. ALSO: I would suggest signing up for the Choice Hotels rewards program. I did this downstairs at the counter and immediately my check-out time for the next day was moved from 12pm to 2pm, which really relieved the pressure of getting reading and getting out the next morning.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100014713">My wife and I stayed here for a marriage weekend and were physically in the hotel for the entire weekend. Here's the rundown: CONS: The first room we were put in was in a section of the hotel undergoing renovations. The hall had exposed cabling and the walls were being worked on. Our room was small and faced Aurora which is a very noisy street. (we were moved later - see PROS.) The hotel building itself was poorly built - the bathroom tile floor was freezing cold (the second floor sits over the parking area - my guess is no insulation in the floor) and the halls and the meeting room were very cold and drafty at times. The area of the city the hotel is in is just OK - a little sketchy but a quick walk to great restaurants and Seattle Center. PROS: We realized we made an error in our reservation and were moved to a different room already reserved for us by the conference. The manager was very friendly and helpful and canceled our old reservation no charge, no problem even though we had already checked in several hours earlier. The new room was in a newly renovated part of the hotel that was tastefully decorated and the room itself was big and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. We had all of our meals for the conference catered by the hotel and the food was very good - much better than food I've had at more upscale hotel conferences. The hotel rates are really good for Seattle in an area walkable to city happenings. In short - I think most people wouldn't be in the hotel all weekend like we were for the conference. If hotel atmosphere is very important to you, you may want to pass on this one. If you want a clean, comfortable place to sleep with helpful staff at a good rate, and you're exploring the city, this would be an economical and good choice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR99469301">Stayed for one night while traveling on Amtrak. The location is very good for tourists, 2 blocks from the Space Needle. Travel to the train station, downtown, and stadium area was also convenient using the monorail and bus tunnel. The hotel was undergoing some renovations during my stay so the elevator was out of service and some of the hallways were tore up. The room was a little dated and could use some work (hopefully will be addressed with the current renovations.) The lobby, pool, and breakfast areas were very nice and the continental breakfast was very good. Overall the hotel was a good deal and hopefully will be even better after renovations are complete. Next time I'm in Seattle I will stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR99168298">This Quality Inn more than makes up for in quality of service and facilities what it may lack in any other area. It was built for the 1962 World's Fair and perhaps let slide for some time. The current GM, Heather Patrick, is doing a magnificent job of restoring the Inn's luster. Her staff, without exception, went out of their way to see to our every need. They are proud of their house and rightly so. The hotel is very close to the Space Needle and attractions that are built on the World's Fair site. There is a shuttle offering free rides to anyplace within a mile and a half radius of the hotel and that more than covers the entire downtown area, including Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and the waterfront. The rooms are somewhat small, as rooms were built back then, but well appointed. Everything worked; fridge, microwave, coffee pot, television,clock radio, iron and telephone, and the bed was very comfortable. The "accessible" bathroom was wonderful; good solid bars to hang on to and a non-skid shower with molded seats. I understand there are some larger suites on the fifth floor (where scenes for the Elvis movie, "It Happened At The World's Fair" were filmed). The plentiful breakfast buffet (including the obligatory waffles) had hot food that was hot and cold food that was cold and furthermore it was tended by smiling, cheerful people. The pool and hot tub are exceptional in every way. I make it a point not to stay in a hotel that does not offer these amenities and so have many to compare these with. The pool is free form concrete with a terrific shallow end for little people and an 8.5 foot deep end for the swimmers. The water temperature was warmer than one might expect but given the raw, rainy outdoors, it was lovely to bask in. The hot tub, up six or seven steps (with a railing), was hot and the jets well placed. Both pool and tub were spotlessly clean every time I visited AND the facility is open from 6 am to 12 pm. There is a fitness room if you are inclined that way. My elderly mother (who uses a walker to get around) and I stayed here for six nights. It was a pleasure. At the time of our stay, the elevators were undergoing refurbishment which made for some inconvenience but not enough to make a serious difference to anything. The lobby boasts a business center, free coffee, 24 hour front desk, comfortable couches and a fireplace - with fire! One more fascinating thing: On the bottom of the pool, in the shallow end, there is a painting on ceramic tiles. It is signed by "Klee Wyn" and I can't find out anything about it. Perhaps it was put there for the making of the movie? It's pretty, depicting a mermaid and a young man in a bathing suit with fish and sea plants around. Worth a stay just to look at it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR96939114">We have stayed at the Ramada, Travel Lodge ,Westin and the Quality Inn since we have been making the Anual September Pilgrimage to Seattle. Ramada was sorry, Travel Lodge by the Needle was so disgusting I was refunded $90. Should have been more. Then we found this place. Yeah the elevators are slow (supposed to be upgraded now) and the carpets need replacing. Yet other than this,for the money and location, it can not be beat. We even stayed down the road at the Westin one year, yeah swanky, but no free parking, it cost me a fortune as I have an overheight vehicle, I had to valet the 3 days. We always come back here. Walk to the Needle and surrounding grounds, Top Pot donuts, Dicks Burgers,walking distance to downtown and Pikes. Also the heated pool which my 3 kids love and you can not beat the savings on a free breakfast for a family of 5. I am making my reservation tonight for our return this September.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR95898326">we stayed here one night 2/6/11 and it was great check in and check out went well our room was ready when we got to the hotel the heated in door pool and hot tub was great and the room we stayed in was 222 the beds and carpet looked like they were brand new and the room looked very clean the free breakfast had hard boiled eggsbacon bicuts and gravy donuts yogurt a waffle station hot and cold cereal fruit milk juice coffee tea my 5 year old was a little dispointed by the cartoon channel it only showed cartoons for older kids and teens she wished they had nick jr but our stay was nice and we will come back again the lake family James Ruchene (RU) and Princess LILLI<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR91421116">I don't expect much when I book a Quality Inn. Two stars should mean a clean, comfortable room and not much else. Our room was fairly clean and this place isn't a dive. But the owners cut corners where they shouldn't. The towels are awful, like scratchy sandpaper. We skipped our showers this morning to avoid them, they're that bad. My husband couldn't get a hot shower all day New Year's Day. I assume they were close to capacity, but shouldn't they be prepared for that? The walls are paper thin, which is to be expected I guess. A child's coughing woke me up this morning and I am not a light sleeper. The elevator is so slow, we saw more people simply give up and take the stairs than wait 20 minutes. We ended up carrying our bags up to the 3rd floor. I am writing this review from a coffee shop because I could not access the internet for 2 days. What's the point of free WiFi if it doesn't work? There's a Hyatt Place and a Best Western nearby that are probably a lot better than this place. Don't waste your money. The owners needs to take the ridiculous fee I was charged for a New Year's Eve rate and buy some towels. They clearly don't take much pride in this place which is too bad because it's in a great location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR90360125">After spending 3 hours traveling the 15 miles from Seatac airport to the center of Seattle in a subfreezing winter storm, my husband and I abandoned our plan to drive home to Bellingham 90 miles north of the city. Leaving I-5, we negotiated our way to a parking lot and began calling hotels in the area. We were able to book a room at Quality Inn and Suites Seattle Center. We didn't have a map and were unfamiliar with the area, and several streets were blocked by snow and ice. John, the Commercial Manager, stayed on the phone with us for 15 minutes, giving us precise directions to the hotel. He greeted us at the door, gave us hugs, and led us to a free, covered parking spot adjacent to the hotel. There was a fire burning in the lobby fireplace, where I warmed myself while my husband registered. We not only got a room with a king-size bed at a more than reasonable price, we were upgraded to one with a jacuzzi. The staff was wonderful, the room clean and comfortable, and after a hearty complimentary breakfast the next morning we were on our way home.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR88477004">I booked two adjoining rooms through Expedia for a weekend in November. My decision was influenced because they had a pool and adjoining rooms. When we got there, the pool was closed due to maintenance.....for the whole weekend. I assume it was due to the comments below where the pool water turned some people's hair green. Not only was the pool closed but I was told they don't guarantee adjoining rooms which we called before we booked on Expedia to ensure we would have rooms that were adjoining.....not just next to each other. Jennifer remembered speaking to me about this and denied telling me we would have adjoining rooms. I would not have booked the room if we could not get adjoining rooms. We had five young kids tired after a long drive (5 hrs) and I just wanted to get checked in. After a long wait and conversations with different front desk staff unsuccessfully trying to come up with an alternative solution, I was told they would let us out of the reservations if Expedia would let us out. So, on the phone with Expedia for an hour we were given the green light to cancel our reservation, however, when they did this while I was on hold, the manager of Quality Inn, Heather Patrick, denied waiving our $80 cancellation fee. Not only would she not listen to my complaint, was rude and unhelpful, I was appalled at her lack of customer service. She blamed everything on Expedia and refused to offer any help whatsoever. She said, "I don't care what my staff did (referring to her manager Jason who told us the hotel would let us out if Expedia would), I'm the General Manager and I'm not letting you out of the cancellation fee because you did not cancel 24hrs in advance." I called the Holiday Inn Express next door and their pool was open and they had adjoining rooms we could get for both nights. I was so disgusted with the staff of this Quality Inn that I didn't care about the fee anymore at this point, I was not staying there! We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and had a great rest of our vacation. The kids had a great time in the pool all weekend and the staff there knew how to treat their customers. They even apologized for our experience and were embarrassed that hospitality staff would treat anyone such as the way we were treated by Heather and her staff. Oh and Expedia ended up waiving our cancellation fee and booking our room at the Holiday Inn Express for the same price. I would have gladly paid the higher rate......the customer service was well worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR87517535">Travelled with 3 young kids, gramma and nanny. Had a suite with 2 double bed in one room and a king/crib in another room. Full kitchen. Great layout with one bathroom. Updated kitchen. Carpet was disgusting. Phones did not work and tv remote did not work. Had a pool but was down for maintenance and no one phoned us prior to us arriving to let us know it was down. One of the main reasons we chose to stay there. They gave us the room for $125 a night to compensate. Amazing price for the area, we walked EVERYWHERE. Free parking too. Free internet (super slow) and continental breakfast was the typical make your own waffle deal. In a nutshell we would stay here again for the price and location. We only we there to sleep so the condition of the floors, etc didnt' affect us to much.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR87212568">Pros: we had reserved 2 rooms. Teenage daughters stayed in one and husband and myself in the other. Check-in went quick and staff was very friendly. Rooms were clean. Pool and spa area was clean and inviting. There is Limited outdoor Parking but this does not have to be an issue: there is a secure underground parking garage - be sure to ask about it at check-in ! Rooms have fridge and microwave, ironing board, free wifi, hairdryer. We do not smoke, but there is a huge outdoor terrace for 'smokers'. Only minutes to walk downtown-great location. Cons: the carpet needs updating, so does the wallpaper in the guest rooms. Both elevators are SLOW. Breakfast was not great, but it was not any worse than the breakfast at a Best Western or a Holiday Inn!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR85101421">We spent 6 nights at the Quality Inn &amp; Suites Seattle Center on John Street. The parking was okay - not as bad as others had let us to believe by their reviews. The halls are in need of updating. The elevators are a pain - always slow. The breakfasts were hardly sufficient. What food we did get was awful &amp; it was always overly crowded. We'd hoped for good coffee since we WERE in Seattle... but it was standard hotel coffee. The hot water in our shower didn't work one morning &amp; when I called the office to report it, they offered to move me to another room. I couldn't do that, however, as I was in town for a competition and needed to get ready and leave by a certain time. Housekeeping failed to clean our room one day and we were gone a good part of the day. We didn't say any thing about it until the following day because we were gone in the evening &amp; just wanted to relax and not have to deal with it. We did mention it the next day. We did tip our housekeeper every day. There was a slider that opened up to a communal patio on the roof... no view - just the highway, but better than nothing. We enjoyed the jacuzzi tub in our room. The bed was comfy except for the dip in the middle of the (king) bed, where you tended to roll. We did find a good pizza place nearby - but they didn't deliver. The Space Needle is viewable from areas of the hotel and within walking distance. The hot tub by the pool was relaxing. The high speed internet was remarkably slow. I would recommend this hotel for someone just looking for a place to crash. If you're looking for a luxurious vacay experience - keep looking.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR84276650">This hotel put a severe damper on an otherwise lovely trip to Seattle. Staff - unhelpful, rude, condescending. We asked for a set of playing cards or boardgames and the front desk did not have any of the basic standard fare that any regular (read: not awful and low-quality) hotel normally would. Pool - unclean. Hallways - low ceilings, stained carpets, dated. Elevators that stop working at 6pm. Just dingy, eerie, and unclean. Rooms - TINY, no over-head lighting (just 2 small flickering lamps), bathroom made for dwarfs, radio not working, stains all over the bed and carpets, sheets looked &amp; like they were dated from the 1960s.

They gave us a really good price. We had checked Travelodge next door just prior to coming here. Quality Inn beat Travelodge's price's by about $15 per room. Quality Inn also offered free parking whereas Travelodge wanted to charge us $12 to park our car. Parking is a little tight at Quality Inn but we did find a space. If you walk out to the end of the hotel lot you can see the Space Needle. The girls at the front desk were very courteous and helpful in helping us find a restauant at a late hour. We flew out of Seattle early the next morning so I cant speak for their room service or breakfast.

Excellent location within Seattle Center, great connectivity to transit network. Rooms are a little noisy, and elevators/hallways are somewhat dated. Breakfast was decent, service was attentive.

The hotel is what you are paying for which means the following to me. Good price for the other hotels in the area. Towels that are a bit scratchy &amp; rough. Lower grade bed, but good clean sheets. Here are the positives: Great location to Space Needle (3 blocks), Excellent help from the front desk - thanks Chris, good location to rental car locations if needed, standard, but filing free breakfast bar, low cost for parking for other hotels in the area, fridge &amp; microwave in the room, two good grocery stores within 1-2 blocks, overall good price for budget.

We stayed at the Maxwell for three nights before moving here so we were a little spoiled. As we were already in town and were told that the parking was limited we arrived early. Rooms were not available so we waited in the lobby. The lobby area is run down, outdated and dirty. Our room 219 was ready at about 1:30 which was fine - it is a very busy hotel. We took the elevator up - slow and creaky! Room 219 was disgusting, the carpets filthy and badly stained. I quickly looked down the hall at some other rooms, as they were being cleaned, and went back to the front desk. I asked the women for another room at the other end of the hall. She asked if the room had been cleaned and I said yes but that it was still disgusting and I was not about to sleep in it. She moved us to another room that was a bit better. The hotel has great potential ! Good location, indoor pool and work out room. Large breakfast area and parts of it have been updated. They need to update, clean and get new furniture for the lobby. The rooms and hallways all need to be completely refurbished. The elevators also need to be updated - they literally creek and are very slow. Stairs are easily accessible, but when you have several suitcases an elevator is necessary. They have laundry facilities but when we used the dryer it ruined two white shirts , they came out covered in grease!! For Seattle this is the best cruise and park package available but if I weren't going to use that particular package I would recommend you go somewhere else until this place cleans up its act!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR78435352">My husband had a Microsoft gathering to attend in Downtown Seattle. I searched on Trip Advisor before I chose here and I am glad I did!! The rates inside of Downtown Seattle were 2-3X as much as this place PLUS they all charged extra for parking &amp; WiFi and so we figured hey, let's pay a little less for the Quality Inn and just walk everywhere. And that is what we did. We stayed mid-week for 3 nights. The $69 rate was very reasonable. The WI-FI and parking are free!! It looks as if there is not enough parking but there really is; they have another "secret" secure gated parking area underneath the hotel. You have to go around to Thomas Street to get to it. I felt very safe leaving my car there for 3 days. There is an elevator in the "secret" parking area that goes straight up to the hotel. Yes, the elevators are slow but they get you to where you have to go. Some people complained about the noise but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. The front part of the hotel faces a busy street but when you are inside you don't even hear it. The back part faces another hotel and is very quiet. Once in a while you can hear people walking in the hallway but that is only if they are chattering away and have big mouths. The room walls are about the same. If you are a light sleeper like me just bring earplugs and you won't hear a thing. The rooms aren't huge but they are very cozy and have a Fridge, Micro, Coffee. Some of the rooms have a view of the Space Needle. The bathrooms are very clean. The shower is hot with excellent water pressure. The beds are very comfy. I found no bugs, trash, weird odors, etc...in the room. It was very clean and tidy and housekeeping was great about keeping everything stocked for us. (I did tip them daily.) The indoor pool and spa are heated. The pool area is very clean. There are towels for you in the pool area. The only gripe I could say about the pool/spa area is the chlorine fumes but it isn't too bad. The FREE breakfast was great but the line fills up FAST so if you get down there anytime past 7, expect to wait. The good part is that everything is cooked fresh and you don't leave hungry. The breakfast crew does their best to bus tables, keep the counters clean, and serve everyone but when they are busy they can get behind on table cleaning. (It isn't their fault.) I made sure to clean up my table after I was finished so the next guy had a place to sit and eat. (I also tipped these guys daily. They worked their butts off!!) The hotel staff I encountered were very helpful from day one. They helped me find everything on the downtown maps, showed me which way to walk, which areas to avoid, etc... Hubby and I had a late night the last night we were in town and so I asked for a late check out and they let me stay until 2 PM!! ( THANK YOU GUYS!! ) Everything around the hotel you can either walk or ride the bus to. If you walk just a few blocks down it puts you into the "Free Bus Zone" and then you can just hop from bus to bus touring the city. We did this when going to Chinatown, Union Station, Pikes Market, Waterfront piers &amp; shopping, etc... We walked to the Space Needle and caught the monorail ($2 each way) into downtown, walked around, had a nice dinner, then caught the bus back. The next day we walked to the free bus zone and took the bus down to the Ferry Piers, and went on a beautiful Ferry ride over to Bainbridge Island. If you want to see Downtown Seattle a very cheap ($7) and beautiful way, the Ferries are the way to go!! The only thing I would say to avoid is the McDonalds across from the Space Needle. There are a lot of drug addicts &amp; homeless in the vicinity and sometimes they filter into the restaurant asking for $$. One woman strung out on something came in and started screaming and yelling and got violent with the manager for forgetting a pickle on her hamburger. Fortunately when the cops came they all scattered but it was still scary. All in all this place is a very great value for the price. Trust me I did my research! The only thing I would recommend is that if you have 2 people who use laptops is to ask for another chair for your room. Otherwise you will have to "surf" from either the bed or sit on the suitcase rack. :)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR78161983">the directions to the inn were bad enough.

All in all, well worth it. We would stay there again-- I would rather stay here for a reasonable rate, and be able to walk everywhere then have to drive into the city and park downtown everyday!

However, it was a miserable experience, full of large, screaming families, reeking of chlorine from the heavily shocked pool, and insanely small room. The common areas were dirty and run down, the room was relatively clean, but smelled terrible. The window gave a view into the parking lot and the room of the people in the hotel nest door. The bed was so hard I couldn't sleep -- thank God I brought my own pillow, because those were in short supply as well. The air conditioner works and the plumbing works. But I have a bit higher standards and I would rather forgo the so-called convenience for a decent night's sleep.

Linens were old and dingy. The double beds were so old and worn that we rolled to the middle of the bed. They were VERY uncomfortable. The room was extremely small, with just room to walk around the beds. Road noise was high. The elevators are very old, and the sensors don't work properly. If you aren't careful, the door will hurt you. Watch out! The location is somewhat central, but it's ugly. All of the equipment in the "fitness center" was broken in one way or another. On the bright side, most of the staff was nice, but the manager made up for it. She refused to take care of a parking ticket their hired service issued despite the fact that we were guests and parked legally in a space in their garage. She said she could take care of it, but that she wouldn't. (Huh??) It made no sense then and still doesn't. We went to another hotel, which was clean, bright, friendly and cheaper! There are MUCH better options!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR59437562">1. Skip swimming. Indoor pool is dirty and not properly maintained. 2. Check everything in the room before settlign in - the guest service pointed out it is the guestâ€™s responsibility to inspect the room before settling in (i.e. faulty shower rod - you may lose your head). According to the Hotel Act, which was posted on the door, it is their responsiblity to ensure everything in the room is in good condition. 3. Ask them not to you in with a high school group. Or you won't get any sleep. 4. Breakfast is basic - not what they say. I will never go back to this hotel for their lack of customer service, inability to handle complaints, their improper management of facilities and false advertisement of the facility. The guest clerk assured that the manager will be in contact. It is a ploy to avoid you. We booked this hotel because of its direct link to the Woodland Park Zoo - don't do it. There are better places to stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR59391566">Oh my gosh -- I haven't seen this filthy of a hotel for . . . well, I can't remember when! The parking lot was a preview, but my wildest imagination couldn't have prediccted what the hallway carpets looked like! The elevator was abysmal. I'm not talking about new dirt or litter -- I'm talking about ground-in crud that would never ever come out! The rooms are old and not much better -- tho the bedding was clean and crisp. The closet was the smallest hole I've ever seen (smaller than a tall locker!) We stood in the room, recapped the clients that we saw on our way in -- and said -- we're out of here! I was afraid for the safety of my suitcases while we went down to try to get out of our non-refundable reservation. The office staff (the oriental young man) was especially kind and graciously did not charge us after all. Don't waste your time even THINKING about this hotel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR59079817">We spent 5 nights at Quality Inn &amp; Suites and it was great. The room was clean and there was adequate space. We booked a suite that had 1 king size bed in the first room with a small kitchenette and the second bedroom had 2 double beds and a bathroom to the side. This room comes with 2 TVs. The pool was a hit with the kids and the hot tub was clean and hot. They picked us up from the Amtrak station for $15 including 7 trunks. And dropped us at the airport at the end for $30, again with 7 trunks and all our other hand luggage. In the US, it is difficult to find hotels that cater to for 5 people where the parents don't have to room with the children for any price, so, this hotel was great for us. And the price was good too. The hotel front desk staff were great, some of them even helped us figure out which buses to take to visit a few of the further flung locations we wanted to get to. And of course it is only a few blocks to Seattle Center, so one can just walk there. Breakfast was included and while it wasn't a great breakfast (we eat mostly fruit and don't like lots of wheat and starch), the breakfast was similar to that we've had in other hotels in the US. I do think that the rooms at the front of the hotel might be noisier as the hotel is on a busy street, but we had a room facing the back and looking onto the hotel next door. Not a great view, but we slept fine. So if noise will be a problem for you, ask for a room facing the back. We used the kitchenette to make sandwiches and to eat takeout foods from the grocery stores nearby. We don't usually dine out as our younger children are not adventurous eaters, so paying a small fortune to eat in an expensive restaurant where the kids don't like the food doesn't make sense to us. We didn't want to eat McDonalds all week either, so the kitchenette was very handy. It is not a fully equiped kitchen. There is a sink, stove, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker and a dishwasher, but there are limited pots and pans and only a few plates and bowls. But it was adequate for our needs as I didn't want to cook meals. The hotel was close to two very good grocery stores, one in the Pan Pacific Hotel and a QFC at the bottom Seattle Center on 5th. Both are about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The store in the Pan Pacific Hotel was more expensive, but they had a bigger selection of takeout foods that were relatively healthy. Both stores had lots of fruit and veg including organic foods. I'd stay in this hotel again if I needed to go to Seattle and wanted to stay near the Space Needle or downtown, especially if I was traveling with children or teenagers. They even have free parking.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58943622">We stay here often on weekend getaways to Seattle. We love the location of this hotel.

We traveled to Seattle to attend a concert at Key Arena, and this was a great choice in terms of location. A 10 min walk takes you right to Seattle Center where you can find the Space Needle, Key Arena, the Fun Forest which has rides for the kids, and so much more. We walked 2 blocks over from Key Arena to Queen Anne street and checked out the little shops and various restaurants offered there. The hotel itself we could tell had been redone with granite fixtures in the bathroom, and updated tile and carpeting. The room we booked was for 2 queens, but the room did feel quite small. The hotel is on a busy street on one side, but that did not bother us at all excepting for the ambulance that happened to go by. We did get awakened by some sort of delivery truck at 5am, but the noise was brief enough that I could go back to sleep. The hotel offers a pool and hot tub which are open until midnight. The free breakfast in the morning consisted of pastries, toast, bagels, biscuits and gravy, cereals, yogurt, waffles, juice, coffee and tea. This was served from 6:30 -9:30 am. Parking was free, but was limited and the lot filled easily. The front desk mentioned that there was an alternate parking underground lot which required your room key as a pass to get in. The hotel overall was clean and the clerks at the front were very helpful with information and even gave me a toothbrush as I had forgotten mine. Check in/out times were 3pm and noon. The clerk did mention that if we wanted late check out at 2pm to ask in the morning for availability. This was not necessary for us, but a nice touch for them to mention. For the location and price we would stay again if we needed a hotel in this area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR54438630">We stayed at the Quality Inn while attending the AFBF meeting. The staff at the front desk knew most our destinations and had maps to draw walking routes on for us. As no Seattle streets go straight for long, the maps were very helpful! The breakfast host was fantastic. We stayed four nights and my husband said goodbye to him on the third morning, saying our plane left too early to eat the next morning. No problem, the young man said, I will come in early and you can still have breakfast. We love that kind of service! And the hot breakfasts made for a great start to our days. Friends of ours also stayed at this hotel. She had left her cane at home, and the hotel loaned her one for the duration of our trip. Again, I think that is above and beyond service. For $87 a night, we were treated like royalty with great breakfasts, helpful front desk people, and nicely made up rooms each night with out personal hot tub (the hotel pool was gorgeous, too).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR54143098">This is not a very nice place to stay.

The second I arrived I knew it was going to be a great stay. We had no trouble getting into the room and a very nice guy parked the car in their specialized garage. The swimming pool was humungous and led to almost an hour of swimming. They recommended an italian restaurant called Buca de Bepo. Moi delesioso! It was a 3 minute walk to the needle and 1 LRT ride away from the market with the original starbucks. In general this is an amazing hotel. Not mentioning the amazing breakfast. The regular continental breakfast with hot food as well. The T.v's were kind of small but way better than some of the others we saw on our trip.

This was a nice hotel with everything we needed. I was given a choice of room and wanted a quieter room so we stayed on the side opposite the highway. The rooms were good and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast was great and included scrambled eggs and sausage. The surface parking lot was full at times but there is also a gated lot that connects to the elevator and is accessed with the room key. We always found a spot. It was convenient to the Seattle Center and a long walk to the Farmers Market water area. I felt that the area was safe. There were restaurants in the area and the hotel staff were very helpful and suggest places to eat. There is a patio on the second floor and the rooms there open onto this area which would have been good with kids. The computer in the lobby could be used for a charge but airline tickets were printed free. There is also a fitness room and laundry. The only drawback was that the hot tub was lukewarm most of our 9 nights stay which would not be a problem if you don't like a hot tub. We would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR46593796">We stayed at this hotel for 3 days, at the suite on the fifth floor.

When I attempted to speak with a manager she berated me and threatened to kick me and my entire family out as my infant and I stood there sobbing. Tiny,dirty rooms with very thin walls- kept up all night by loud neighbors. Small parking lot.

The reception staff were friendly and useful when we made queries about Seattle and where to find specific shops and tourist attractions that we wished to visit.

The hotel wasn't very clean and none of the employees seemed to care about anything. The room was tiny, noisy, and smelled bad. I had reserved a crib, reminded them when I checked in, and then still had to call the front desk after I got to the room to ask them to bring one up. The internet connection was too slow to use and disconnected before you could complete anything. The vending machine on our floor was out of water so I walked to a gas station about a block away for some. I think I was the only sober person at the gas station except the clerk. I didn't feel very safe walking at night (late, but still light) in the neighborhood. Parking was free but there weren't enough spaces for the number of guests.

When we arrived, the reception staff couldn't find our name, Venere hadn't booked us a room. Fortunately we had printed the confirmation and no money had been taken. The staff has been extremely helpful, they gave us a room (which I thought wouldn't be possible as it was the w-e of July 4th and that they had told other people that they were full!!) for the same price as offered on the internet. Looking at the pictures and the previous reviews, it seems we had a pretty big room (two double beds). Everything was really clean, of course it was a bit noisy as we overlooked the freeway but it was not the noisiest hotel we stayed at during our stay in the US. The swimming pool was clean and the water was a nice temperature. The breakfast was excellent with waffle makers, bagels, muffins... It is a walking distance to the Space Needle (a must see attraction) and a 15 min walk to downtown.

This was the first time I've ever switched hotels after making a two-night reservation. Let me start with the positive, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was extremely small, had to walk sideways between the dresser and the bed. Very noisy, due to location/proximity to freeway, and the air conditioner was just about as noisy as the freeway. Unable to plug in microwave, TV, and coffemaker at the same time due to unavailability of outlets. Towels were paper thin, and knees almost hit the sink when sitting on the toilet. Elevators were slow, and the overall appearance of the hotel was grimy/dirty. We didn't swim in the pool, but another guest (who I met in the elevator) told me it was freezing, supposed to be heated, but clearly not. Switched to LaQuinta a few blocks away for second night in Seattle -- very pleased, well worth the additional twenty bucks!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37304479">I definitely would NOT stay there again. Rooms are too small even for 2 people. Beds are advertised as queen, but they were not queen sized beds. No counter in the extremely small bathroom, so no place to put things you are using. Not enough room to put out the luggage holder without tripping over it or stubbing your toe.. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hallways not air conditioned. If I had brought my laptop, there wouldn't have been anyplace to put it on the desk that was crammed in the corner. It had the coffee pot, ice bucket &amp; glasses on it and no where to move it to. If you like a quiet room, ask for a room away from the road. I couldn't believe that there wasn't any place to park. They advertise that they will let you leave your car there while on a cruise, but what about the other guests that are staying there while you're on your cruise? Lack of parking was a big deal to us. We had to PAY to park in a dark alley behind the hotel. If I had paid full price for the room, I would have been very, very angry.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR36995320">My husband and I stayed here for four nights at the end of our Canadian adventure holiday. Out of all the hotels we stayed in, it would probably be the bottom of our list but that's not to say it was terrible. The location is good, very near the space needle and although we didn't go up the needle, we did go on the Duck tour (highly recommended) which was near the needle. It was about a 15 minute walk to the centre of the downtown area, but if you go down Denny Way towards Westlake Drive it is more picturesque than going any other way. Whole Foods Market is nearby and we had breakfast there twice. We didn't use the buffet breakfast in the hotel as both times we looked in it was very crowded - obviously popular! There was a pool and hot tub which looked clean although we didn't use them either. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives - the room and indeed the whole corridor had a 'sour milk' fragrance going on! Not sure if this is the smell from the cleaning fluids or what. The air conditioning unit in the room was VERY loud so we had to suffer the heat at night as we turned it off. You could also hear the people above moving around above us. Having said this, the bedding and bathroom were very clean. We wouldn't let the above put is off staying here again and indeed talking to the staff just before they left, they said the hotel is always full and very popular with families.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR36757009">We stayed for three nights and had problems parking everytime we returned to the hotel. When there is a parking space it is next to impossible to get out or you are in danger of someone else hitting your car. They say to park at your own risk. On the street parking is available at $1.25 per hour between 8 am and 6 pm Mon - Sat. Free on Sunday. Or you can park in one of the local pay lots for $9.00 per day or more. Everything else about this hotel was great. Our room with the King bed was bigger than the ones with the 2 queens. The Breakfasts provided were excelent. The kids loved the pool and workout center.

Received no correspondence or verification regarding my reservation or cancellation because the hotel entered an incorrect email address, mailing address and spelled my name wrong in their system. Not surprising because I was put on hold numerous times during my calls regarding my original reservation and cancellation. Obvious confusion resulted in my reservation and cancellation and my reservation was never cancelled. Hotel charged me a $156 no-show charge for a reservation I had cancelled. Hotel management claims their system is failproof. They refuse to refund the no-show charge; however, they offered me a free night's stay to compensate me for my trouble. Why would the hotel offer me a free night's stay rather than refund the no-show charge that they should not have charged me? Obviously they know a mistake on their part was possible if offering some compensation. Hotel has simply responded through my Better Business Bureau complaint that they will not refund the no-show charge, but will provide a free night's stay to me. They will get away with this again, even if a small claims court awards me the reimbursement of the no-show charge. I recommend not staying here, not necessarily because of their mistake (mistakes happen) but because of the unscrupulous business practices of their management and their unwillingness to admit and correct their error. We stayed at a MUCH nicer hotel (I have stayed at the Quality Inn Seattle Center on two occassions before this incident), Pioneer Square Best Western Hotel for just a little bit more money.

This hotel has kind of a 1960s motor hotel theme going on. Our room had two queen beds but was a little cramped. The location and the breakfast were easily the two best features of the hotel. We were only a few blocks from the Space Needle and the Sci-Fi Museum/Experience Music Project. It was an easy walk to the "free zone" for the buses, which allowed us to get to Safeco Field for a Mariners game without driving or paying for a cab. The breakfast was a full hot buffet, with biscuits/gravy, sausage links, etc. Pool looked nice, but we didn't use it. The parking situation left a lot to be desired. There were no spots left the night we arrived, so I had to park on the street (no charge) and move the car at 8:00 the next morning to avoid feeding the meter or getting a ticket. A tip: Use your keycard to get into the underground garage off of Thomas St. I saw the gate and didn't realize guests could use it until after I'd already found a spot in the regular lot. The desk staff didn't make it clear that it was for guest use. Internet access was flaky in our room on the third floor near the end of the hall. I tethered with my BlackBerry for most of our stay. My last complaint is that it cost me $2 to receive (not send) a one-page fax. That can't really be justified in my mind. I would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34348920">The staff is what makes this place great. They are all very friendly and helpful. Our room was very small. A single queen (was it a queen though?) and barely enough room for two people. Free parking upon availability (= don't arrive after 8 PM with a car) made this one of the better values if you're driving. Location is good right near the needle, but not GREAT because there is a very busy highway bypass that runs right by the front - and this adds a fair amount of road noise - also it means you can't cross the street easily if you want to walk east. Free breakfast in the morning. There are a fair selection of eateries and such around, if you walk in and towards the water. At the end of the day it is a quality inn, and a reasonably well kept one at that once you get past the road noise and congestion of the location. Though the rooms are smaller than standard.

It was one of the less expensive hotels in the area and I was not expecting luxury, but my overall stay was disappointing. On the good side, it is in a safe area just a few blocks from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and Pike's Market and the waterfront are walkable (although a little bit of a hike). However, the rooms and lobby are tired (the entire building really), the breakfast area overcrowded and it is serviced by a single, small, slow elevator. The advertised free shuttle to the dock was instead $6.00 per person and contracted out to a van service and the high speed internet was also down. The front desk staff was adequate, but I could have accomplished the same goals for less (with a better breakfast) at the adjoining Travelodge. At best, this is a 1-2 night hotel when waiting to go on a cruise (which about half of the guests were). For that purpose, it's fine. However, if you are visiting Seattle as your destination, I would look elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19488866">I had to make a last minute trip to Seattle while two conventions were going on and this was the closest hotel to the downtown area I could. When you arrive the dingy 70's exterior doesn't do a lot to ease your mind, nor does the location but once you get into your room things improve. It seems to be newly renovated and everything was clean. Bed was quite comfortable and the room was quiet, despite facing a rather busy street. The rooms are quite small but I live in NYC and I'm used to tight quarters so it didn't really bother me. The breakfast room makes your high school cafeteria feel like the Ritz and is a rather depressing start to the day, I'd skip it and talk a walk over to Belltown for a proper cup of coffee and any kind of breakfast you'd want. Totally acceptable for what it is, a motel on the edge of town.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19050632">I have been to my share of hotels and this one have surpassed my expectations.

The continental breakfast is well stocked and is of good quality, the bathrooms are newer. Price is not out of line for downtown Seattle. Down side: Parking is a royal pain, not nearly enough of it. get there after five and good luck finding a space, staff not all that helpful in most regards. OLD hotel, very slow and rickety elevator. While bathrooms are clean and look new, they need to replace room carpets or something, because ours smelled like a gym bag filled with sweaty socks. Hallway smelled old and musty as well. plug in alarm clock in room did not work, had to call twice to ge a replacement, then the replacement(which was older than the original one) did not work either. It was okay for a one night stay before heading to the airport the next morning, and as I said quite close to space needle and tourist spots downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17965950">The hotel is clean. The odd numbered backside rooms escape the traffic noise. Near things. But a feeling of long cave-like halls, mild service, and what a bloody small room. Europe? Nope, Seattle. Not a bad deal at Seattle prices, but certainly the Queen rooms are nothing I look forward to again. Fine, but not uplifting.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17655897">This is a great hotel to stay at if you have lots of downtown Seattle activites planned. We spent three nights here and weren't disappointed. The ONLY complaint I have (which really is minor in the scheme of things) is that there is only one computer in the lobby with internet access and it was really difficult to get on it with the hotel being very busy. I think for the size and capacity of this hotel, they should definitely have a second or even a third computer. I also think that travelers who want to spend time on myspace and other sites like that should bring their own computers and have the common courtesy to not monopolize the only computer available for guests. With that being said, the rest of our time here was great. Public transportation has a pick up right in front of the hotel. We opted for this for trips to Pike Place Market, as parking down there would have cost us $15 and the bus cost us $6.50 round trip. We walked to the Space Needle, restaurants, and also walked to the dock of the Victoria Clipper (Pier 69). We found it much easier (mostly beacuse of parking prices), and left our rental car parked in the gated parking lot beneath the hotel. Breakfast was abundant, but the breakfast room was WARM and always full so we did take the food back to our room. The people at the front desk were incredibly friendly and helpful with travel ideas, bus routes, restaurant suggestions, etc. The Mariners were in town and they had sign-up sheets at the front desk for shuttles to the games for $5/person. We had a room that had a sliding glass door to an outdoor area where everyone from the hotel had access to. I wasn't happy the first day back when our curtain had been opened by the housekeeper so everyone could see in and see what we had. The next day the curtain was kept closed which I was thankful for. Our room was always made up and cleaned very well. I did a load of laundry and found it reasonable at $1.50 per machine to wash and dry.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17505457">We just needed a basic room to use after a late concert at Key Arena. We checked in around 4:00 and the staff was very friendly. We were very thankful for the free parking as well. The hotel as a whole is older and a bit dingy, but it was good enough for us. Our room was quite small, barely enough room to walk around the two double beds, with a table, chair, and TV crammed into one corner, but since all we needed was a bed and bathroom, we were fine. The bathroom was small too, but clean, and lots of hot water. The air conditioner also cooled the room very well. The free breakfast had a good selection and tasted good. In short, if you need a no-frills hotel close to Seattle Center, and don't want to pay for parking, this is a good place to stay. If you want big and fancy, you won't be impressed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17504172">We stayed one night on the 5th floor. Hard to find - directions not clear. On very busy road, so pretty loud. Elevator really slow and made ominous noises. Lighting on floor dim, sort of creepy. Room layout weird - two sliding glass doors out to tar paper roof - no seating, no signs saying Stay Off. Small kids next door were of course drawn to edge. Could not get DVD player to work and called front desk to ask question - staff didn't know but would send someone up. Canceled request. Not in best area - thought we could walk to Seattle Center but homeless people were sleeping in doorways between the two places - and I have young girls. Opted not to walk. Stuffy smelling. Windows grimey from the inside. Odd mixture of furniture. Free continental breakfast hard to locate and about what you'd expect for free. Room was not ready at check in time so they deducted $10 off our bill. Will not stay there again. Ever.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17237227">OK, I'm tired of some of the finicky reviews of this place. It's a Quality Inn, for Pete's sake. Don't expect the Ritz. It's a perfectly fine 2* hotel. I was there for UW commencement and the city was busy, so this was the best I could do. I got a rate of $95 on Quikbook, and that was the best I could find ANYWHERE for this or any other decent property in downtown. When I arrived, I asked for two beds. The clerk was knowledgeable and efficient, and said she had only one left, but the rate would be $99. No problem. Still a deal for these dates. The lobby had a kind of Northwest lodge feel, with stone walls and floor. There was free coffee available and limited free newspapers. The elevator was kind of creaky and battered, and the guest room hallways were pretty shabby, but the room itself was spotless. Event the edges of the carpet seemed vacuumed, something I often don't see in 4* hotels. It had a beamed ceiling, again with the lodge feeling, and a microwave and mini-fridge. Plenty of room. Free wireless internet (although sometimes a weak signal). No problems with noise. The free breakfast was pretty abundant, although the breakfast room was crowded. There were signs about not taking away food, but my sister brought me stuff anyhow. No big deal. So I was perfectly satisfied. There's FREE parking! Some is in a lot alongside the street (Aurora), but there's also a hard-to-find garage. Go behind the hotel and completely around the block to the other side. You'll see a small Quality Inn sign over the entrance. You enter with your room key, so access is completely controlled. The elevator will take you all the way to the guest floors. I'd say the elevator was the biggest problem here: it was slow, old, creaky, and ugly. Otherwise, everything was fine. They even have a nice indoor pool off the lobby. The location was good. It's not in the thick of downtown, but DT is very accessible in a few minutes walk. If you exit the hotel and go right down Denny Way, there's an area with cafes and restaurants, and further down is the Space Needle food court. There's also a McDonalds near the Space Needle. If you go a few blocks north on Denny Way, there's a Whole Foods Market. And if you're in a hurry, there's a convenience store/gas station on the corner of Denny and Aurora, about 2 minutes walk. So I would not be afraid to stay here. I hope this hotel will move up in the rankings.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16501337">We stayed in room 319 for 7 nights in May. It had a king bed, small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. It was on the rear of the hotel and had a view of the parking lot and next door hotel (see pics). Luckily, we did not come for the view. The room was spacious enough and the bed comfortable. The front desk personnel we talked to were always friendly and helpful. This is a good cheap hotel, but do not expect anything fancy. The bus to downtown stops right outside the front door and comes often. We preferred to walk most places, itâ€™s an easy walk to the Space Needle, monorail and Experience Music Project / Science Fiction Museum and not much farther to go downtown and to Pikeâ€™s Place Market. Room 319 has an adjoining room, the first few days the room next door had 3 chatty German girls in it. And the last day or so another group of girls had it who stayed up loudly until about 5am. I use ear plugs, so I could sleep, but my husband was somewhat bothered. Take your swimsuit, thereâ€™s an indoor pool and spa which was great to soak in after walking all day. I found the hot tub to be super hot each time I went, the pool was always too cold for me, but I'm from Phoenix. The breakfast was plenty adequate for us, a bagel, coffee and yogurt are fine for us. There were other cold items and a waffle maker as well.

I looked at the website and there were tons of rooms so I called back and was able to book a room for the exact same dates I said the first time with no trouble?!?!?! Should have been my first clue.... Then when we get there she wouldn't process my Canadian debit card at the front desk and told me I needed to find an atm. She told me I could go up the street to a gas station. We did, but then the next day realized that there was an atm that worked fine for our card right in the lobby of the hotel?!?!!? THE WORST PART - At some point in the middle of the night, someone opened our room door. It caught on the chain but it opened. I woke up but wasn't sure if I was imagining it or what, so I just stayed awake all night after that. The next day we went down to breakfast and then tried to come back, and our key cards wouldn't work. We went to front desk and it turns out that when we paid the day before no one had bothered to check us in fully in the computer, so in the middle of the night the front desk guy gave our room to one of his friends.... Then he deactivated our keys because we weren't checked in?!?!? This hotel is disorganized and has terrible service. Also, the location isn't that great, but you can walk to downtown and its cheap.

The area was originally built for the 1962 World's Fair. The area appears to be mostly offices and t.v. stations. We did walk a few blocks to find some restaurants and there is a food court in the Center House near the Space Needle. The monorail from Seattle Center runs to Westlake Center mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants. The hotel was built for the fair, but was added onto several years ago and recently the rooms were updated. Our room was rather small for four adults, but since we were out sightseeing most of the time it was fine. The room had 2 double beds and included a microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom had been updated with marble floor and new fixtures. The staff was friendly and helpful and we found the hotel to be clean. Although the hotel was full during our stay, our room was very quiet. The hotel is next to a very busy highway. With the window closed, the noise was not a problem. Parking is free at the hotel, which is great for a downtown hotel, but stalls are limited. They serve a nice breakfast, near the pool area. The breakfast room fills quickly, so the earlier you get there the better. Although the area around the hotel was not very tourist friendly, we thought the hotel was a bargain. $115/night for 4 adults, free breakfast, and free parking in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11063829">Drapes looked like there had been a massacre in our room, balcony area (for smokers) was directly outside our room and had people partying and carrying on ALL NIGHT, bathroom was still dirty (spiderwebs under the sink), interupted by maintanence the next morning because my shower was leaking into the room beneath us, breakfast buffet resembled prison food with NOWHERE to sit...will never stay there again!!!!

We were unable to check in as we arrived early, but the staff were kind enough to check our bags and deliver them to the room when we checked in. We were on a limited budget, so our room was small, but comfortable and we only needed to ask for more pillows, blankets, etc. and they were delivered promptly. The bed was very comfortable, sheets clean and soft and the bathroom and rest of the room clean as well. We just wondered how those strange handprints got on the ceiling...? The breakfast is fantastic, but don't forget to bring your breakfast tickets! The pool was nice and open 24 hours and there is a great looking gymn available. We didn't use the gymn... hey, we were on vacation! but I saw others enjoying it. If you don't want to rent a car or pay for a taxi, you can walk the 2 blocks to the space needle and take the monorail downtown, where you can walk anywhere or catch a cab for a few less dollars. Just remember the monorail shuts down at night, so don't get stranded downtown. All in all it's a clean, comfortable place, wonderful all you can eat breakfast, not doughnuts and coffee like others and in a good location for a reasonable price.

However, I would suggest the Travel lodge, Holiday Inn Express or the Best Western which are all within blocks of one another. This like many other hotels in high tourist areas, takes in a lot of group tourists arriving on buses from various locations. Warm breakfast was very good, scrambled eggs and bacon, toast, bagels, coffee, juices, cereal and even waffels. Unfortunately you had to walk through the lobby and pool area to get to the dining area. The corporation obviously had purchased the facility from another chain. The renovations included new carpeting and wall covering in the halls, a refrig, microwave and coffee maker in the rooms and marble, yes marble, flooring, vanity and a new tub surround in the bath. They forgot the carpeting in the rooms, which were terrible. In our room, when we walked across the floor it "loudly squeeked" as though the flooring was not nailed down tightly below the carpet. The first night we had to change rooms because the walls were so paper thin that you could hear the voices in the next room speaking in their normal tone of voice. We moved at 11:00 p.m. The resturants in the area are supposed to be within walking distance, they are if you are a young adult or an avid jogger, we rented a car on the thiord day just to be able to get to the "local" resturants.

The room was very comfortable, albeit VERY tiny. But it was quiet and clean. Just a bit of a squeeze for the two of us that stayed there. The bathroom had a couple of design flaws but overall it was great. The door was at such and angle that you ran the risk of banging your knees while using the toilet. And just like the room it was small, but it was bright and clean and had nifty little towel shelves in the corner. The showerhead was actually tall enough to stand under instead of needing to crouch down and contort to get under it. The front desk and housekeeping staff were very friendly and efficient. I arrived 2 hours before check-in time so I had to wait, but they had lots of big squishy chairs to sit in while I waited. Then during check in, they took guests in the order they arrived. So the people who'd been waiting since 9:00 in the morning got to go first. My only real complaint is that it is a bit tricky to get to.

Hotel is not far from pier 66, but if you arrive by car and are not familiar with the roadway system getting to it may be a little daunting. Spotted it easily from the highway, but there aren't any turn-offs to get to it. You must drive down a distance( around 45th street), and then turn right in order to get back onto 99/Aurora St. going south. Once you do that the hotel is on the right about 3 miles up. Check-in was easy, although they didn't have any rooms available when we arrived, they will check your luggage. Received our parking placard, parked in their parking lot(free), then proceeded to walk 3-4 level blocks to the Space Needle, Experience Music Project(EMP), Pacific Science Museum. Once there you can take the monorail($2-adults, 0.75-youths) to downtown. Walk 2-3 blocks downhill to Pikes Public Market and waterfront. We were told that Pioneer's Square is not far from there, but since it was raining, we decided to go back. With all that said, I believe the hotel is in a great location. Front desk friendly and helpful, coffee in lobby, pool, hot tub and sauna open 24 hours. Our room was a 2 double economy size which was adequate for our needs (2adults, 2teen-age boys and 1-2 medium sized pieces of luggage). Bathroom was small, but our room, hallways,and lobby were clean. I would recommend though, if you are staying for an extended stay to opt for one of their larger rooms. Breakfast was filling ;consisting of bacon, eggs, cereal, fruit, yogourt, juices coffee, danish, bagels. cubed potatoes self-make waffles. Other than the small bathroom and slow elevators(this gave us a chance to get some well needed exercise in and take the stairs). The hotel was much more than we expected, especially for the $95/night we paid. Oh yeah, check out was a breeze. They place the bill under your door the morning of departure.

To start off, we looked for a hotel in downtown Seattle for we were going to the International District (Chinatown) for four days. My main preference was to have an indoor pool (who knows what the weather will do, so you can't go wrong with that,) and our budget was under $125/night. We got a deal of $100/night at Hotels.com and they indeed had an indoor pool. I've had interesting experiences renting hotels from just seeing websites, and this one was one of those times. The parking is BiZaRRe - not only does MapQuest or RandMcNally.com tell you they can't find it on the map, but if you find it yourself while driving around you only have 2 ways to enter the lot... if you overshoot the entrance then you end up on the frickin' highway. Moving on... check-in was crazy... a TON of people were having problems checking in (from online reservations of all things) and surprisingly when it was our turn they found our reservation easy and got us a parking permit and 2 keys without a problem. However, we booked a king and got to the room and it was 2 doubles, and 1 key didn't work. Bleh... I was tired and my husband and I just took advantage of more space and slept on the separate beds instead of stand in line to complain about that error. Bathroom was good, carpet was ok - not the horrible conditions I expected when reading everyone else's reviews. Thought maybe I'd have a view from the window, but all I got was a lovely view of the Travelodge right behind us (teeny tiny view of the Space Needle if you look at the right angle.) Definitely within walking distance to the Space Needle and only a few blocks to restaurants, the malls/stores downtown, and only a few (drivable) neighborhoods away from the International District. The pool's location isn't that great - right behind the hotel lobby (so much for privacy.) But the pool is really clean, and the adjacent hot tub was nice - could easily fit 8 (10 kids probably.) We opted for dim sum downtown every morning, but the one morning I decided to check out the breakfast I saw a pretty decent spread - lots of fresh bagels, huge fresh muffins, a juice machine, coffee, yoplait yogurt cups, and I saw them putting away eggs and turning off the waffle machine - and that's a lot of good food in my opinion. Overall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10 - only an 8 because they did screw up the room and the parking sucked - if there were no vacancies then there wouldn't be enough spots - good luck on the street. The Holiday Inn Express across the Street had the same parking issues, and the Travelodge behind us looked 4x more run down than where we stayed. But for the money and the indoor pool and the breakfast and location, I really don't have any major complaints.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5731811">This place was a dump. The room was small, beds were uncomfortable &amp; low to the ground, the carpet was gross, the noise from the street was constant and the night stand looked like it was picked up at a garage sale.

Our room had a king bed and was very, very small. The A/C was very noisy. Good breakfast, but dining area grungy looking. Hotel plus, it is convenient to the Space Needle. Their transport to Safeco Field is small shuttle bus, we were told it could handle 14 passengers. After realizing that it could not hold the crowd waiting we had the hotel call us a cab - never saw the shuttle in a 35 minute wait. It is a slow trip to the game at rush hour, don't see how the shuttle can make many trips back and forth.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126917025">My husband and I spent 4 nights in March, 2012, at this downtown Seattle hotel. Location was perfect! Close to Pikes Market, across the street from a movie theater and Cheesecake Factory, and lots of shopping (Forever 21, American Eagle, Macy's, Ross, Nike, etc). We took the bus to Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks. Took the ferry to Bainbridge Island. I only have three minor complaints: we had requested a king bed, but was given two doubles; the Concierge wasn't too familiar with the public transportation; and housekeeping failed to remove the previous ocuupants black panties left in the bathroom.

However, my husband and I were shocked at how thin the walls were at this hotel. We could easily hear our neighbors on both sides of our room. In one room, there was a woman with a very bad cough - totally not her fault but we felt as though we were sharing our room with someone with a bad cold. We could hear her coughing literally all night. On the other side of us, we had a group of people who were in party mode. Finally at 1:30a.m. my husband called the front desk, and they had to send someone up to deal with the situation. We will not choose to stay at the downtown Sheraton again - the next time we decide to take a night off, we will be staying elsewhere. The other disappointing thing is that the hotel charges $44.00 per night for parking. We are completely used to paying for overnight parking but this amount seemed very high to us.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126629289">Enjoyed my stay in this well located, well appointed hotel in central downtown Seattle.

We had originally booked 1 night through the conference and when we attempted to add 2 more nights - and receive the conference rate - we were given the runaround by 2 reservations people who couldn't confirm the original reservation but yet assured us the new rooms would be connected to the original room and rate. When we checked in, our room was not ready and we we forced to wait. When we finally checked in, there were dirty dishes in our room. Due to the inept reservations people we dealt with when making our reservations, we were forced to check out and re-check in each day and we were charged a different rate for each night. When we called to try to work something out, the accounting department refused help us. We travel 2 weeks per month on business and usually stay at SPG properties. We had hoped our status would have gotten us better customer service.

On this occasion, my daughter and her new husband had only a few days before they were separated again, so my husband and I thought we would like to give them a couple of days in the city. When I called, I made it clear this was a honeymoon trip, we wanted it to be special, and I wanted to have my credit card available to the couple. I was assured there was be upgrades, champagne waiting in the room, and the young couple would be treated well. A couple of days later, I called to just check on the reservations. I wanted to be sure it was a special time. There was no note regarding my requests, no note about a honeymoon, nothing!!! After four different calls, each time explaining the circumstances over again, the manager assured us all would be well and the couple would be treated well. I didn't have much faith. Sure enough, the room was mediocre, not on a special floor as suggested, nothing was in the room to welcome them as we were told....nothing was done! It was so disappointing. I will not be staying at the Sheraton again. It is hard to believe that after that many phone calls to get something "right", the place failed miserably to meet any expectation!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126424618">I had planned a really romantic getaway for my husband's and my anniversary a few weeks ago and decided to venture up north to Seattle. When I booked the Sheraton, I told them my situation and asked if they had any rooms they would be able to upgrade us to given the circumstances. I want to be careful and objective in this review, but it was unfortunately a disappointing experience. When we arrived and I surprised my husband, even more surprising was the $44 a night valet charge. My jaw dropped at the outrageous price to park a car. We drove a block down and parked in a $15/night garage instead and trekked up with our bags. When I checked in, the front desk staff had complimentarily upgraded our room to a junior suite which was such a considerate gesture that we appreciated! They left us a nice card, some roses and chocolate covered strawberries which was very kind of them and such a nice touch. However, our room was located directly in front of the elevators, and for the entire evening we could hear the doors opening and closing right out front of our door as people got on and off. Not a great start. When we sat down on the bed, we immediately bounced right up because the beds are SO hard. One of the hardest mattresses I have ever slept on, and we have been to many hotels around the world. Even a tempurpedic mattress pad would solve this problem. I had trouble falling asleep because the bed was so hard, and I woke up with a crick in my neck. When we entered the room, we noticed that it probably hadn't been vacuumed in awhile because the floor had pebbles, small rocks and barkdust all over. It was as if someone before us went hiking during the day and brought their dirty shoes back in the room. Literally there was this kind of dirt all over the floors and I had to wear socks so I wouldn't step on them. Finally, at about 4am our next door neighbor decided to conduct business from his phone, which we could hear the ENTIRE conversation of. And it's not because he doesn't have a right to conduct business at 4am, or because he was talking incredibly loud... it's because the walls were SO thin we could literally hear his entire conversation word for word at a normal talking voice. This kept us up until 6:30am, when we finally were so upset (and tired) that we decided to just get up for the day. We went down to the lobby to ask if there was any way we could switch rooms, but they said there were no other kinds of rooms in that category and they would have to downgrade us. We decided that a downgrade in a quieter room was worth a good night's sleep instead of being kept up in a bigger room, but it was quite disappointing having to pack up and move on our romantic weekend, and then be placed in a much smaller room without any compensation. I understand that it was kind of them to upgrade us from our queen room in the first place, but it was disappointing that our anniversary weekend turned into this kind of experience. The location was good, but I just can't think of any reason why I would want to willingly return to this hotel when there are so many other great ones in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126339724">As many reviewers said, the hotel is centrally located, close to every tourist attraction. My husband and I enjoyed the environment very much---fresh fruit from the Pike Place Market, wonderful French cuisine at the Champaign Cafe, and all the department stores and book stores. But the hotel is a bit disappointing. The restroom looks old. Only glasses are provided in the room, no decent cups for tea or coffee. In other words, it is more like a cheap hotel than a 5-star one. I think it's such a pity. If the management works harder and attends to details, this hotel can be easily a great one.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126046481">I recently checkout of the Sheraton Hotel located at 1400 6th Ave Seattle, WA. I I checked into the hotel(room 723) on March 12 after my check in was complete and I was about to walk away I was handed a letter stating that the hotel will not have water from 10am - 2pm that day. At this point I find it extremely rude to give this to me after I have checked in as an oh by the way type of approach this information should have been presented before I completed check in. At 4pm on March 12 I tried to take a shower but when I turned the facet to the hot water it was extremely cold. I turned the facet to the cold water section thinking maybe the streams where crossed during the outage but that to was cold. I ended up using the warm section but this was lukewarm at best. I chalked it up to maybe the water system just needed time to get warmer since the outage. I went about my night. During the night I kept hearing a loud metal clinking noise which I believe was coming from the heating system. This loud noise happened every 15-20 minute needless to say I did not sleep. On the morning of March 13 I went to take a shower after my night of no sleep. I turned the water to hot and it was still flowing as ice cold water. I tried the cold section again and it too was ice cold. I once again took a lukewarm shower. I went to the desk to check out around 7:45 when asked about my stay I told the "trainee" who was completing my check out about the noise and water situation. She apologized for the issues and I asked for the number to your corporate office she did not know where it was and told me to wait for the other woman to come back. I waited and when the other front desk worker came back as there was another guest waiting she helped that person first before assisting her trainee. She was very dismissive and handed the trainee a business card that was for the Seattle location when I had asked for the corporate office. I pointed this out to the trainee and again she tried to talk to the person training her. I waited for five minutes but needed to leave to get to work as the other person working the desk was obviously trying to avoid having a conversation with me. I find this behavior along with the conditions of your hotel to be completely disgusting. I have staying in hostels that have running hot water this is something that is a basic utility.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR125986392">This was the perfect location for my meeting at the Seattle convention center.

Great view from 30th floor. TV didn't work upon arrival, but when I called for service, they sent a tech up pretty quickly to fix it. My only gripe about the room (besides being misled about the bed size) was that the iron is cheap, can't even stand up on end and therefore dangerous.

The room was comfortable, and good views are available from the higher floors, either towards the mountains or towards the waterfront. Excellent choice of tea and coffee in the room, with the Earl Grey being particularly delicious. Check-in and check-out were accomplished with a minimum wait time. I found the fact that the restrooms on the first floor needed an access code for entry was a nuisance (as people can sometimes be in a hurry!), but I guess this is thought necessary for security.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122345559">I must say for a 4 star hotel, the sheraton in seattle is clearly overrated. i was annoyed by the fact that there was no information or brochure provided in the hotel room that described the amenities of the hotel. we didnt know whether there was a pool, what restaurants, bars etc. the hotel inlcuded. of course we found out, but were hardly impressed. the pool is tiny, and since the hotel itself is huge, it is usually overcrwoded. the hotel only has only one restaurant (with the creative title daily grill...) ane one little bar. what angered me was that you have to pay for internet - in my opinion a classy, 4 star hotel should include internet for customers and not charge 12 dollar a night and that movies on TV were even more expensive, i.e. 16$ ! we stayed in the sheraton for new years this year, and were once again disappointed when we came home after midnight, as did many many other hotel customers, and were informed that the bar had closed already. it would have been nice to sit down in your own hotel bar, after seeing the fireworks outside, and have a glass of chamapgne or a cocktail. however, the bar was closed to the dismay for many customers. overall, the stay was hardly impressive. the hotel has a great location and the inventory is ok, but for a 4 star hotel with a great name, one can except more.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122337031">The location of this hotel is hard to beat. Great lobby and friendly people working there. Room service lacks big time. It was horrible. Both times I tried it. I travel mostly for business so my time is valuable to me and room service saves time. But not when you cannot get what you want - cooked how you want. One huge plus if you get stuck here is that 1/2 block away is Morton's and 1.5 blocks away is Ruth Chris. The place is outdated and over priced for somewhere needing as much updating as this place does. I travel a lot and I will not be back to this location. I am gold SPG. Diamond with Hilton and Hyatt.

My experience with some large chain hotels is that they tend to be loud. I found this Sheraton to be nice and quiet. The rates seemed reasonable for a downtown location, and I had a corner room with views down 6th and toward the water. There are a number of restaurants in close proximity, and the Daily Grill in the hotel had good food. There are more than one movie theaters near by for those who are interested. In general, a good stay, good sleep, good food and a friendly staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR121998953">I checked in late in the evening, but it is off season so there are many rooms empty in Seattle right now. The woman at the desk asked if I had a preference--which tower--i indicated i did not but i was eager for a room with a lot of light (after all it is Seattle). She said there was a nice North-West facing room, which seemed to meet my needs. The room actually faces west--but it is a solid wall. It was a funny shape--so the only windows were on the north wall--and there were fewer windows than most rooms. In fact, per the location map it was the smallest room on the floor, and with few windows, all of which faced north, unlikely to meet my only request. My rate was not the cheapest rate available, I am a Platinum status (VERY frequent Starwood guest), and there were many open rooms. It made no sense to put me in that room which would have definitely not been light. I called and requested a different room (I cannot recall the last time i did so). They were literally flummoxed. The next room was acceptable, but very ordinary, and by that time i was thinking a nicer experience would be nice. When i call to see if there was an early departure fee they did not even inquire as to why i would leave early. And when i checked out, they did not say anything. Very impersonal and disinterested service. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom grout not clean, and overall fairly dismal room. Two stars for the comfortable bed. Given the time of year, i checked around, and there are some lovely properties for less money than i was paying at the Sheraton. Now ensconced in one such property--and so happy i changed hotels. Not happy to pay the early departure fee but that is the last money that property will see of mine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR121992802">I'm a Seattle native and have stayed in this hotel annually for a long holiday weekend of shopping and enjoying the sights and sounds of the season. In the past my stays have been wonderful and the hotel has lived up to its reputation as a Sheraton. The Gingerbread Display in the lobby each year is always a real treat and this year was no different. What was different however was the very poor planning by the hotel event staff. On this particular weekend a large corporation was hosting their holiday party. Presumably the company was so large that they needed multiple locations within the hotel to serve their needs. These locations were on the Ballroom floor, the 20th floor and the 35th floor of the Pike Street tower. What this translates to was a nightmare of epic proportions for hotel guests who wanted to get up to their rooms (or downstairs to leave) between the peak hours of the party, which happened to be between 8 and 11 pm. During this time it was impossible to get on the elevator because each and every elevator was packed full of party goers. It was so crowded that party goers were getting on the first elevator that came along and riding it to wherever it went so that they could "reserve" their space to their desired floor. Myself, along with many other paying hotel guests waited around 10 minutes or so just to secure a spot in the elevator. To me this was unacceptable. The hotel should have had the foresight to know this was going to be a problem and blocked off a group of elevators strictly for party goers. Whether they simply program the elevator to only stop at the party floors or put someone there to ensure paying hotel guests can access the elevator, it would have made for a much better experience for PAYING hotel guests. I know the hotel gets paid quite a bit to host these types of events and a large portion of attendees actually stay at the hotel (been there, done that) but for the other paying guests such as myself, we expect to receive the same level of treatment. Not to throw out the "do you know who I am" card, but I am also an SPG Platinum member so I have also contributed a lot of money to this hotel chain and expect to be treated as an elite guest every time I stay at an SPG property. Sadly at this time, it was not happening. Other than that fiasco, my stay was great as usual. The room was clean and spacious and the front desk staff was always friendly. I'll stay here again next year but this time I will be sure to request a room in the Union Tower where there are no facilities for corporate holiday parties.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121939175">For girls weekend in downtown Seattle, we chose the Sheraton!

We purchased a holiday package and were supposed to receive an Amazon gift card after our stay, but was told after our stay that it won't be available for up to six weeks. Very misleading, as the hotel apparently knows this is the case, but makes no attempt to alert customers to this fact. We had a ho hum breakfast at the Daily Grill with two kids meals, two adult meals, 2 kids juices and 2 coffees for $65 and paid $45 for parking.

Here goes my review for a fairly mediocre business hotel experience. I picked the Seattle Sheraton for a last minute business trip primarily for its location and proximity to my meetings. The lobby is nice and checking in was painless. The room was exactly as expected - your standard box hotel room. Now, the bed was unusually comfortable and comparable to higher end hotels. All things being equal, a comfortable bed is probably my number one factor that distinguishes one standard to hotel to another. I was disappointed with their internet access, a key need when away on business. I usually seek hotels that include internet access in their rate, but when you pay $10+ per day extra for access you at least expect a good connection. Not here. I barely got above 1 Mb/s on their line. To give you an ideal, I get that on my phone and at home I get 20Mb/s. It was not adequate. The barely warm shower â€“ A few weeks ago I had a business trip to a very remote area of Colombia. I was surprised that even that one star hotel in Colombia had good hot water. Now, when you are at a Sheraton in Seattle, you expect hot water. Not here. I was shivering as I took my shower. Shaving with luke warm water is even worse. Mediocre at best and that is only because of the great bed and location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121680969">We left the car with the valet parking and quickly checked in with out a problem.

We live in Everett, only about 25 miles away, but we often stay here for a weekend outing involving baseball, football, or shopping. Our most recent visit was Dec 1 - 4. We arrived at around 3:30 and even though our room was not ready (lots of people checking in at the same time for the Sehawks game, and a high occupancy load due to a bridge tournament being held on-site), the front desk clerk was very helpful and offered to give us a key to the fitness center so we could change into gameday gear. We dropped our bags at the bell stand and headed off to the game. When we returned, we were pleased to find that we had been upgraded to a corner room and given a bonus of 2500 Starpoints, as thanks for our patience. Location is perfect for shopping, dining, theater, or symphony - walking distance to everything. There are tons of excellent dining options within walking distance as well. The lobby bar is comfortable and spacious, with a decent wine selection and some very personable bartenders. Tip: it's worth paying the extra few bucks for a Deluxe room in the newer Union Street Tower. The rooms are larger and beautifully decorated in simple, relaxing neutrals. Plenty of room at the desk to work, and the work area is well-lit. Rooms are always sparkling clean and the staff has always been friendly and helpful.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121383836">Our room was in the new tower, facing south and thus offered an nice view of the park at 2Union Square. The room was pretty much an ordinary 'nice' hotel room: two armchairs, two queen beds, long desk/dresser. Not a lot of drawers for two people and a long stay, but adequate. Beautiful tub, stylish vanity with not a lot of counter space. Similar room in the other older tower was slightly smaller, with homey blond wood 'country' style furniture (lots of drawers), bathroom had a small tub but a large granite vanity. Hotel concierge was most helpful. Little coffee/breakfast bar (like Starbucks) great for coffee and grabbing a quick bite, but not open late. Fitness facility on the top floor with views is topnotch with 6+ top of the line treadmills and 4 or 5 stationary bikes, plus weights, mats, and other machines. Pool is a decent size. The public spaces are contemporary and spacious. Hotel location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing, right next to the Convention Centre. Pike Market is a 10-minute walk. The service in the hotel was by and large excellent. The only thing we couldn't quite wrap our head around was the "green" room cleaning concept. You are offered the option of not having your room serviced at all, for which you receive a $5 voucher which can be used in any of the hotel's eating and drinking spots. But there didn't seem to be an intermediate option of just having the maid come in and make the beds and vacuum. Mostly we got fresh towels and bed linens every day, even though we would have preferred otherwise. Three calls to the front desk could not clarify this. But that is a minor quibble.

We stayed in the Sheraton Seattle and the experience was excellent. The hotel is located next to the Convention Center. If attending a conference, it is the place to stay. The Lobby is grand, the entrance floor is nicely decorated, there is a nice bar, restaurant and other conveniences. The room is very good, comfortable, has everything the guest needs. The Chinese cleaning ladies were wonderful trying to please the guests. The view, in particular from the gym in the 35th floor is breathtaking. Staying in the Sheraton was marvelous experience. The city has everything a tourist wants: the downtown area is very well preserved, clean and in particular at this time of the year, the fall, presented astonishing colors varying from green, yellow and all ranges of red. taking the monorail towards the space needle and several museums is breathtaking trip over the streets. Walking down to the water front we get to the fish market, where the first ever Starbucks cafe is located. In this market besides the fish that looks out of this world, one can walk and buy fish, fruits, vegetables, flowers and also clothes, enjoy good restaurants with nice view. it is possible to take the ferry to several destinations, including Canada. the nearest destination (only 35 five minutes away) takes you to Bainbrige as we leave Seattle by ferry the view is something we canÂ´t describe. The city skyline facing the water is astonishing. Take a bus tour and get a good idea of the city has to offer, including the floating bridges, with well projected landscapes in both sides.

This hotel is pretty nice. Everyone I met was pleasant and helpful. They even have an awesome program where you can opt out of daily housecleaning in order to be more sustainable which works for me since I don't need my room cleaned daily. The incentive that comes with the program is a $5 credit towards a food service for each day you opt out. It was great! The rooms were nice and clean and I loved the bathroom. It wasn't anything super special, but it was nicely appointed. As soon as I drove up and the valet opened my car door, he said "Hello, you know there's cheaper parking in a garage about a block away". I'm pretty sure I didn't solicit his advice for cheaper parking. I always valet my car when I go to hotels (and usually it's some kind of rental car), but the way he said it was as if I would struggle with affording the valet fee because I wasn't driving the right type of car. It's a steep fee, but I can definitely afford it. Wasn't a great start to my arrival. The front desk team and the bell desk attendant were pleasant though, so I kind of let it go. But that was the thing that stuck out in my mind. Any other time I went to the valet to get my car, the other gents were very nice. Two people even came by when they thought I had been outside too long waiting for my car to ensure that someone was getting my car. One gent even offered to go and check on the car because he thought I had been standing out there too long. I hadn't been out there longer than a minute or two, so that was appreciated. Never have I ever had such bad back pain from sleeping in a hotel bed. I tossed and turned all night and the bed was a bit stiff in places. I woke up with the worst back pain. I have never experienced back pain before and this was pretty intense pain across the entire top half of my back for the rest of that day. Other than these two cons, this hotel was very nice. I wouldn't stay there again only because the beds were so uncomfortable and the back pain it gave me was virtually unbearable.

Check in was fine, nothing to report. We were given a nice room on an upper floor. The room was average - everything was clean and quiet. Other reviews are correct, the towels are older and there are no bathrobes. The beds are comfortable and clean. However, the valet parking fees are very overpriced and the attendants wait and expect a tip. We even found a few of the compartments in the vehicle ajar although we don't keep anything of importance in them (and they are always closed). The hotel is in a good location. Another thing we found a little strange was our experience with the concierge. We went down late on to talk to her about where to go for dinner. She said that there were only a few restaurants in the area and they were all booked up. We had never been to Seattle before but we assumed there were more than "a few" restaurants around and that she couldn't be right. We had to speak to her for a few minutes before she would even make a call to try and get us a table. We ended up getting a 9pm seating and when we got to the restaurant it was 3/4 empty. We both thought that the concierge may have been a little out of date with the happenings of the city and did not have the proper connections to fulfil her role. We also asked about night clubs and after dinner drink bars and she was only able to recommend the stuffy bars more suited for older adults (we are 28-36).

The bed was good, but the sheets were ridiculously overstarched and super noisy. One other picky comment was the short sleeved uncomfortable bathrobe. We parked a block away in a secure indoor lot (the valet suggested the lot) for $30 a night which was better than the $40 plus valet rate.

So a view of people's offices! The concierge was at times short and not helpful. Service was worse at the front desk, they have to be retrained on how to serve customers with courtesy and pleasant attitude. The club lounge is again AVERAGE, no soft drinks were available, just water, tea and coffee. The waiter was more interested in getting tips, rather than serving. The breakfast was also AVERAGE. The hotel is dated, carpet was dirty and worn.the bathroom was old and dated, the shower/bath tap conversion did not work. The gym was again AVERAGE, the treadmills are on the mezzanine level of the gym, so you have a view of half of window and half of the wall! The equipment was AVERAGE and limited. The location is good for shopping, close to the major shopping centers. However, there are so many homeless people around, at almost every corner and around the hotel, I felt quite unsafe to be wondering around here.

They mention on their website that they have done all of these upgrades, and that is true, but they must have upgraded from okay to nice.

The staff seems friendly, the location is great as it is within walking distance of everything. We stayed on the club floor and it has breakfast included. I am a SPG gold member and I am suppose to get a complimentary upgrade but it wasn't available. When I asked about paying for one, it magically was available. (Rolls eyes). The breakfast and evening appies were okay. For the extra $15.00, I would say that it was worth it for two. The bathrooms are small. If you are staying to get ready to go out, then this would not be a great option for more than one person per room.

We always bring some of our own along so I didn't even ask. Just assumed they would restock after use. As others have mentioned the sheets felt more like some sort of paper. The rooms were not cleaned very well the whole time we were there. Cups of water were left sitting on the desk until I emptied them and rinsed them. Do not expect to sit outside of the hotel and not be hounded by people begging for money. We heard about every line you could possibly think of. Really a Seattle issue that I believe the city should deal with as they were everywhere! Upon check-out we found that we were charged $35.25 plus 7.75 tax for valet parking but we did not have a car there. I tried calling the front desk to get the charges removed but no answer. Ended up having to go down to get it taken care of. All in all I would not recommend this Sheraton.

I showed up to the hotel to find out they deleted my reservation. They never apologized for the inconvenience and finally offered me a pull out sofa to sleep on for the night (I declined). The next day I was told by my company event planner that they had a room for me. I went to the front desk to get my room keys and they asked me to get the name of the person who spoke to them, etc., etc. It took me 4 check-in attempts for them to finally give me a room. I would have been more than happy to go back to The Alexis (a much nicer hotel) but on Day 2 they issued me a room. During the course of the week, we had sessions smoked out by roofers who were too close to the vent and for 2 days their internet connection was down. On my last day at the hotel, I left my jacket in one of the conference rooms and the staff made me call "0" on the phone and leave a message on their lost and found line rather than talk to someone in person. I had to ask 7 people where the physical lost and found was located as my car keys were in my jacket. No one seemed to know... The hotel has potential. The room was pretty comfortable and the location is good. However, I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I cared about.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118510727">My husband and i booked a west coast road trip to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We had 6 total stops and thus, stayed in 6 total hotels. This was by far our worst stay. We started out disappointed because they had put us in a double room (two full sized beds). 5 years ago, my husband had a full bed as a bachelor and being tall, his feet hung off the bed. Sharing a full after coming from a King at home was not a pleasant experience. HOWEVER, i do understand that room type is not guaranteed. Had it been a nice bed, i probably wouldn't have been complaining. Listen to the other reviews, the sheets/comforter/pillow cases feel like paper. They actually feel disposable....literally the worst bedding i have ever experienced. Not to mention the sink was cracked, and there was someone else's socks under the bed, so not properly cleaned. Location was good, but we would definitely book elsewhere for our next stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118495552">I loved the decor; the privacy; the view. I did not like the check in and check out which was long and line up format. There was a way to do it via phone. But I forgot to inquire beforehand. The other complaint is parking. $43 and some change per night. I thought it was awful! The most I have ever paid especially when you could park down the road for $6. Otherwise this hotel is a great location. A short walk to Pike's Place. Amongst all the shopping.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118454497">Very nice Hotel stay. Nice rooms, good service, wonderful lobby. The location is in walking distance of everything that matters in Seattle. A few blocks from Pikes Market, Macy's and Nordstrom, the monorail to seattle center and walkable to Pioneer Square. Right next door to the convention center makes it super conveinant for folks with activities scheduled at the center. Friendly staff. Room service is a bit pricy - higher costs for same items downstairs plus delivery fee and gratuity added. I would definately stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118434665">* Location was great - walking distance to nearly everything we wanted to do, in a safe neighborhood. * Rooms were well appointed and clean * Doormen and front desk staff were excellent * Lobby was very nice and clean * Only flaw, the drain in our bathroom was clogged and the hotel maintance crew couldn't get it fixed right over the course of our three day stay. * Regardless, I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again in a heartbeat.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118380829">This was a very frustrating stay. The stay began very well, as the front desk clerk was extremely friendly. However, I was disappointed that for $250.00 a night I experienced the following: sheets that when I moved it woke me up multiple times (I likened it to sleeping in Christmas wrapping paper); and two gigantic bird droppings on our bedroom window. Additionally, when we went to breakfast in the morning at the Daily Grill Restaurant we experienced a 15-20 minute wait. While this typically would not be bothersome, it is when you see over five empty tables that were not being bussed. The restaurant had only one busser moving below average speed (I would be too, if I was stuck bussing an entire restaurant by myself). Anyways, we ultimately got sat after one of the tables that was dirty when we walked in was bussed 15-20 minutes later. Our wait should never have taken place. While many people will praise this hotel for its location, the Seattle downtown is HUGE. There are hotels on nearly every other corner, each with a prime location. In fact, friends stayed at the Washington Athletic Club one block away and were granted with an equally nice room and view, at a price of only $150.00. Overall, I was disappointed, because if I'm going to pay $250.00 a night, I want to walk into a well-oiled machine and not feel nickel-and-dimed. I will definitely not be a repeat customer at that Sheraton.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118248755">My husband and I met our good friends here for an overnight before boarding our cruise ship to Alaska.

The room was fair, nothing special. Our view was of other building...not great. The maid service was good. The swimming pool says 4.5 feet , well if it was 3.5 I would be surprised! Could not really swim there. However the workout room looked nice and overlooked the city we did not use it. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't say anything about that. The AC did not work very well, I had to put it on 64 degrees just to keep it cool enough to sleep. The towels were very small and thin. They only give you two for two people....what is it about bathing don't they understand? Lucky I brought my own snacks, because the cost of a candy bar or bag of chips in the room was $3.50 WOW. The mini bar was nice but there again very expensive. We got the key to the mini bar and put our own fruit and drinks in it. The location could not have been better; I could walk to the Pike Street Market and shop, have lunch or dinner. Easy walk and always a great experience no matter where I ate. The market really does not open completely until 10:00 am. However you can go to the Crumpets shop for breakfast as early as 7 am. Oh my and if you like Crumpets this is the place for you, I choise the ricotta and blackberry...could not say enough about it. I needed a drug store and close by on Pike Street was a Walgreens, however there appeared to be a lot of homeless people hanging out here. That did not bother me, but for some maybe try a different area for a drug store. There were long lines and a tad of yelling going on in the store! Not to mention one of the fellows was very poorly bathed and I had a hard time getting near him. I would stay here again but I would just ask for a better view and I would ask for double the towels. Oh if you have to park a car get ready to pay! We thought we would forego the $43.00 parking fee of the hotel and park across the street in the parking garage because we got back at 9:30 pm. Well mistake! We had to pay $45.00 even though we only parked for 10 hours! there is a premium you have to pay to park there overnight! wow don't fall for the false sign that says 10-12 hrs 27.00! Not true and taxes are 9% on top of the parking fee. Just park at the hotel and forget about trying to find a bargain, there in not one in Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118108480">I stayed in this hotel as part of a conference at the nearby convention center. It is quite convenient to the convention facilities as well as lots of restaurants, and shopping. The room was pretty standard, the price was not too bad for a big downtown hotel, and the lobby was nice. I was told that I would have free internet access because of my Sheraton rewards status, but the one time I tried to check it out the web page seemed to suggest a rather substantial fee so I dropped the idea. For tourists, it is only a few blocks away from the Pike Place market, a block or two from the light rail station (that can take you to the airport or near the stadiums), and a block from the monorail station that takes you to the space needle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118083827">My grandparents took my cousin and I on a cruise that left from Seattle, so we stayed in the Sheraton one night. I typically really like the Sheraton, and this stay was no exception. I loved that we could walk so many places from the hotel! Since it's right on Pike's, you just walk down a few blocks to get to Pike's Market, which was great. And there's a bus/subway station right around the corner (we took a bus to U of W). The next morning, when we weren't sure where our ship was docked, the staff was very helpful with getting us to the right place. It was also a surprise to find a pool/spa and gym on the top floor!

We stayed for 2 nights in mid August. We are a family of 4: mom, dad, son 7 and daughter 10. When we arrived we were able to check in without a wait but they tried to check us into a room with one kind sized bed. I had reserved, I thought, a king room with a sofa bed. The gentleman at the front desk assured me that I was being given a room with one king bed although it was on the club floor. I said, club floor or not, the 4 of us can not sleep in one bed. About 8 months prior I had called the hotel directly as I was having no luck using the computer or 1 800 number to find out if they offered sofa beds as we find this combination works well for our family. I finally, after over 2 hours of my time over 2 days and a weekend, spoke to the front desk manager who provided the upgrade to the club floor and assured me, I thought, of a room with a king bed and a sofa bed. When we got to the room it in fact only had one king bed and had no sofa, bed or not. There was room only for a chair in the room so we went back to the front desk and asked for a rollaway bed which they informed me would be a charge of $20/night. I said I didn't feel it was fair to be charged as they booked me in a room that couldn't accomodate our family. They then waived the fee and we slept 3 in the bed and 1 in the rollaway. The pool is small and cold but good for the kids as it only went deeper in the middle. The view from the pool was stunning. There is also free computers to use in the lobby and we found this very usefull to book tours and check on weather while we stayed in the hotel. WE used the concierge a few times and found her helpful to a point but the wait for her services could be up to 30 minutes and she seems to book things for other guests but would tell us to use the computers on the other side of the lobby. We would never have known the computer were there without her telling us. The club floor gave us access to the club lounge which provided a good breakfast and evening nibbles. There was side selection but also a lot of people. We appreciated being able to have access to this lounge and having free fruit and water available 24 hours. The room didn't overlook the mountains, water, or even the Space Needle, but we enjoyed seeing the sun rise and the window was deep and the kids liked to sit there and watch whatever was going on below. The room was small for 4 people put would be plenty for 2.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117923739">We go to Seattle frequently for small getaways but have never stayed at the Sheraton before now.

I have the highest level of status with SPG (platinum), so spend quite a few nights a year with Westins and Sheratons. This was the worst lounge I saw. The tables were not cleared, the food, beverages, snacks were not properly stocked. The remenants that were out were not stored at safe temperatures (Milk, Yogurt, Cream Cheese, Mozzarella were not placed on ice and were just left in the open). Furthermore the lounge charges for alcohol. Most lounges have complimentary beer and wine. During the three times we were in the lounge, the lounge attendant never once greated us or offered to clean a table so we didnt have to sit in other people leftovers. Beyond the lounge, when we arrived, we walked into our room, the cleaning crew was still there.

It is very convenient to many Seattle attractions and shops. The hotel is a lovely high-rise with, thankfully, many elevators.The gym on the top floor was one of the best I have seen in a hotel. There is also a pool up there. Our room was standard but fine. The problem with this hotel is that it is extremely busy. There is always a long line at the front desk. Apparently there are two cruise lines that work out of this hotel. We found out at 4AM that the acoustics leave a great deal to be desired as nothing going on in the room next door was left to the imagination. That was not fun. We were there for 3 nights and we were quite amused by the gum wrapper on the floor by the elevator that probably stayed longer than we did. The staff was very attentive and the wait for extra towels was quite short.

Sure, we said. Little did we know that what we signed up for was a total lack of service. Trash not emptied, soap, coffee, toilet paper not replenished. "We don't even enter your room", it was explained. The icing on the cake was that, on check out, we found that $15 worth of vouchers were added to our bill, not subtracted. The front desk explained that the restaurant was not owned by Sheraton, so the hotel was not responsible for that error and could do nothing to correct it. (The restaurant promised to get back to us sometime about it. We're still waiting.) So it seems the Sheraton "green program" allows it to lay off several minimum wage housekeeping staff at no cost at all to the hotel. We're all for conservation, but it appears this policy does nothing but conserve profits for the corporation at the expense of working class jobs, and ultimately, our business. (As an aside, why is it that large hotel chains like Sheraton always find it necessary to charge a substantial fee for in-room Wi-Fi, while budget chains and independents always are able to provide it for free?

So I decided to book our stay there as well. It took forever to book in...very busy front desk...but when we finally got settled into our room, my mum and I decided to go for a short walk around the block as it was still light out. No sooner had we stepped out of the front doors onto the entrance "porch", which was again exceedingly busy and chaotic, my mum walking with a cane and holding onto me, she didn't see the step to the driveway, stepped out and fell full length on the driveway amidst all the cars. I was horrified to see my elderly mother flat on the ground, I tried to pick this small woman, couldn't, and though the area was FULL of Sheraton personnel, bell hops, captains and such, another guest helped her to her feet. We sat on an outside bench for a few minutes as she was shaking, and then we went for a very short walk to see how she felt. We came back to the hotel shortly, went to the restaurant for a cup of tea, and when my mother took off her coat (which thankfully she was wearing over a thick sweater) it was apparent that she was bleeding all around her elbow. The waiter noticed us looking at the blood and went to get a couple of bandaids. We then went to the front desk to ask for bandages, antibiotic ointment, anything...and while waiting there, a burly security guard arrived and insisted on accompanying us back to our room to check her arm. Absolutely no offer was made of first aid, medical assistance, only to check if her injury was valid. Hmmm....lots of concern re: legal action, but no concern for my mother, which in itself is cause for legal action, I'd say! But all we wanted was some first aid, some humanitarian concern, and all we got were a few bandaids! When we checked out after two nights, I asked if perhaps as a goodwill gesture (since the hotel had done nothing else!) if they would consider crediting us for the $55 room service bill for one OJ, two pieces of toast and a pot of coffee!! And after quite a wait, all we got was an offer of a couple of $5 coupons for our breakfast...which we'd already eaten. When we returned home, I took my mum to see her doctor and we were told that she should probably have had at least a couple of stitches as it was a very bad laceration. It took three weeks of daily cleansing and bandaging until the wound finally closed. The hotel should have offered first aid. However, I WILL NEVER STAY IN ANOTHER SHERATON HOTEL... I don't care where it is! Very bad customer relations!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116574791">When we arrived we were thrilled with the looks of the hotel and it's in a great location of downtown Seattle. When we got to our room we were pleased at first... for a minute. All of the surfaces of the room were dusty, so we thought maybe it just hadn't had guests recently. Then we noticed body hair in the tub and on the commode. We changed rooms. The second room had long hair in the tub, which we were just going to rinse out. Then we noticed on top of the dresser there were food crumbs and rings from glasses that hadn't been cleaned. The desk had been eaten at too. So we changed rooms. Our last room, 2614, was cleaner than the other two, but still dusty everywhere. There is a marble ledge next to the window, this was very dirty and had obviously not been cleaned well in quite awhile, there were finger marks in it where someone had drawn their name. We were too tired to change rooms again and just went to bed. The bed was VERY comfortable. There is not a fan in the bathroom, or at least one you could turn on to get the steam out when you take a shower. There wasn't a dressing table or mirror outside the bathroom, which is nice so you can do your hair and makeup away from a steamy room. The AC didn't cool the room very well, the halls were very hot. Ok, the dirty room behind us, here is a review of the rest of our experience. Parking, with tax, came to $43. Internet is not free, it's $10.95 a day (we were very surprised at this). Our car has auto headlights, so we never turn them on or off. For some reason the valet turned them on, which we didn't notice when we went out shopping and to dinner. When we came out our car was dead. We called the hotel. They told us to call the valet company, which we did. We were informed they had absolutely no way to come jump our car even though we were only 6 blocks away. I called the hotel manager who seemed like he was trying to help. After 45 minutes of being on hold and going back and forth my husband flagged down a stranger who had battery cables and he jumped the car. Thank you stranger! After all this the hotel did comp us the $43 for parking. We bought our room through Priceline, so not sure whether that had something to do with such a crappy stay or not.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116518067">The Sheraton Seattle is a great location if you are taking an Alaskan cruise.

Pros: the room was very large and included a pullout couch (although I was told on the phone that none of the rooms had sleeper sofas), the view was incredible of the city, the location was perfect, and the front desk personnel were nice. Cons: the room was old and the bathroom was subpar, the hot tub by the pool was not hot, the room was humid, after waiting 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to help us check our bags, and the bedding was musty. Conclusion: I have since heard that there is another tower in the Sheraton that has nice, renovated rooms. If that is the case, I would ask which tower you would be in before booking.

I stay at hotels about 1.5 months a year nver had I experience an overbooking issue that I was involuntarily been asked to use another hotel. I am an SPG member and booked with AMEX as GUARANTEED room about 3 weeks before arrival date. Went to the hotel at 9PM .. alot of ppl still checking in everything seems fine. Agent took a while when back and told us it was overbooked and they will accommodate us at the Fairmont. I was okay with that as I am a FQTV member at Fairmont and it is technically a higher graded hotel, Just the location not as preferred, the only reason why I chose the Sheraton. I asked if it was a 2 double bed as I booked my room as 2 double. Agent said no, it is a King bed but can get a rollaway bed in the room. I asked to to call Fairmont again and see if they can get us 2 Beds. After 20 min the Manager with the agent came out and told us they tried calling all the hotels in seattle and no one has 2 Beds.. he then said Hotel Monaco is my only choice. I was wait... didnt the agent said there was one king bed at fairmont.. he said not anymore. Hotel Monaco i asked... i have nver heard of it and the logo looks like a hostile .. he said it was part of the kimpton hotel and the room is a "suite" king bed with rollaway bed. He then pointed out my hotel rate was only $119 and the hotel monaco "suite" is $260.. he told me the difference is the compensation of this ordeal.. ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I dont care if i payed a dollar to get your room.. I paid for a SHERATON room for SHERATON central location.. now your sending me 5 huge blocks away that is not walking distance and the hotel was CRAP... monaco looked like i went to a tacky mexico resort and it was definitely not a suite! Called RES and they couldnt do anything..... NEVER BOOK SHERATON SEATTLE! I do not believe the hotel was 100% booked.. they could have UPGRADE others who've paid more to suites .. or those in suites to president suite.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115354399">The room was great, compact and with all mod cons. Perfect for people not wanting to apend a lot of time there. The pool is a joke. We were on the opposite tower and there are no changing facilities, so we had to cross either the main lobby or go through the convention centre (not easy when it's convention time). The pool itself is tiny and there are no places to sit around. By time 2 kids were in the pool, there was no space to swim or relax. What a shame, particularly affter they make so much of it on their website. Also check out the Daily Grill (accessed within the hotel)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115336952">The room was extremely comfortable and the air incredible. They must be using a great air conditioning system. The best bedding too. The only negative was a breakfast at the restaurant - I walked out after trying a really bad coffee (in Seattle!) with non-fat milk, as they did not have a regular milk or cream.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115270507">Have stayed at both the Westin (Downtown) and recently at the Sheraton. Both were good hotels, but with subtle differences... Location: Sheraton is in the heart of the downtown core. The front is packed with cars and taxis, bringing in people for conventions and from the cruise ships. If you're looking for a fun time right at your doorstep, the Sheraton is the place to be. Places to eat (Cheesecake factory kiddie corner to the hotel) and shopping (H and M next door) are easily in walking distance. You can feel the energy as soon as you step out the door. Great place to stay with friends. The Westin is about 2 blocks away from all the action, so it's a bit quieter. Not as many cars in front nor does it feel crowded. So, if you're staying with younger kids, the Westin may be the better bet for a quieter stay. Both are walking distance to Pike Market (6 blocks from the Sheraton, 5 blocks from the Westin). Parking There is valet parking for $43, or you can self park at the 'hotel' off site parking for $30. If you go through the side entrance of the hotel, it's across the street (next to the Cheese cake Factory). It seemed secure, with a 24 hr attendant. I dropped off the family first at the hotel then swung around to the garage. But, it did get a bit crowded while unloading luggage as it's a very small drive way for all the vans, cars, taxis. At the Westin, the self park is next door, attached to the hotel by a sky bridge. It's only $25. Check in Definitely a lot longer line up at the Sheraton, but it does go by fairly fast. At the Westin, the line ups are barely there. Rooms We stayed at the 29th floor, in the older tower. The rooms were fine, nothing to complain about. It looked like they updated the rooms fairly recently. Flat screen tv, king bed (couldn't get 2 doubles!). Bathroom was adequate. The Westin rooms are similar in style, but definitely noticeably bigger. Not sure about previous complaints about paper thin walls. I couldn't hear my neighbours. But, we did hear the little child running back and forth in the room above us for a while. Also, the doors definitely slam a lot louder than at the Westin. Both give you a $5 voucher every day you decline house keeping services. Beds The pillows at both hotels are amazing. The only difference in bedding between the two hotels is that it seemed like the bed sheets at the Sheraton made a lot louder 'rubbing' noise whenever you moved. Sounds strange, but true! Overall The Sheraton is definitely the place to be for all the action, literally across the street. A lot of 'energy' as soon as you leave the hotel. The Westin is just a couple of blocks away from the action, so it's a quieter hotel. Both are good hotels, you can't go wrong with either.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114221687">I visit Seattle from time to time for business trips; this time thought I would extend my business trip with the family to tour Seattle a bit more. We are currently staying at this hotel and we are very disappointed at the level of service we come to expect from Sheraton. We initially called up registration to ensure there is a refrigerator with a freezer and microwave available in the room, the agent assured us this can be and will be arranged for us. Upon checking in, talking to registration desk to double check on the refrigerator and microwave. We opted not to go with the microwave, as we were not told it would cost $30/night, however, the refrigerator we need, as we require to freeze some of our pre-made baby food. She mentioned the refrigerator will be in our room later tonight and asked in the meantime to freeze our food in the hotel freezer, as even if we get the refrigerator it will take a bit for the freezer to be cold enough. We proceed to give our cooler bag to the bell service to put in the hotel freezer, and talked to registration desk about other things, afterwards we noticed the bag we left with bell desk was still there with no one around, so I waited until a bell attendant returned which was another 15 mins, and asked these needed to be put in the freezer as they cannot be defrosted, he mentioned he will take them to the freezer when he gets the chance, and left it on the floor. I was very agitated by now so I waited in front of him and he looked at me and said he will put them in the freezer shortly. So I said they have already been out here a while, fortunately another bell attendant came and took the bag (which I assume he is taking to the hotel freezer right away but who knows). Later that night our refrigerator did not come so I went to registration and asked when is our refrigerator coming, she mentioned she did not get back to us yet as she found out the mini fridge did not have a freezer. I told her I called ahead to ask and was infromed there is a fridge with a freezer in the room, and now in both cases there seems to be an assumption there is. Why would registration agent and the registration desk both assume there is freezer available but now to find out there isn't, all she can say is she cannot do anything as there is no fridge with freezer, and understands there are cases where customers would require it, that does not help me a bit. We end up having to go to the bell desk everyday asking to take out items from the freezer and put it back in, which may not be bad but bell service is not the greatest to say the least. Very disappointed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114187619">Sheraton is connected to the Seattle Convention Center, so what you are getting is a huge hotel with little personality. That said, for a big downtown hotel it was better than most. Location is great. Right in the heart of the city. Room was decent size, clean, bathroom was very clean :-). Beds were reasonably comfortable. Front desk help was polite. Expensive parking: $41 a night for Valet, $31 a night to self park 1 1/2 blocks away. Though nothing special I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114055810">The rooms were great: clean, very comfortable beds, plenty of space. Not a great view, but I'll happily give up a knock out view for a quiet, comfortable room while traveling for business. The workout room was great, nothing crazy but good for getting a run in while I was away from home. The only negative was the service throughout the hotel. The front desk wasn't able to locate a package that was left for me and sent me to the bell hop stand, who then sent me right back to the front desk, where another staff member found the package right away. Twice we went up to the concierge desk to get recommendations for dinner, and both times we were told by the person behind the desk that they were done for the day (around 6pm) and we should direct our questions to the front desk. I understand people need to get home, but we were put off by the way we were treated each time. Not to mention the front desk just pulled out a tourist map and looked at it slightly confused without offering any real assistance (or recommendations). Room service also wrote down the wrong room number and I had to go out in the hall when I heard them knocking on the wrong door for 10 minutes. The rooms were wonderful to come back to, but dealing with the staff turned out to be the headache.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR113405790">What does this Sheraton have going for it? Front desk staff, Concierge, house keeping staff, great gym, great pool, nice big comfortable rooms, comfy beds, nice views on upper floors, antique stores, aquarium, parks, REI Flagship store (large wall climb), shop till you drop shopping, new and used bookstores, Pike Street fish and flower market (Saturday a.m. is best), restaurants to suit any palate and outdoor paradise a short ride away. Take the really cheap fairy across the bay for a lunch or dinner. I took the Seattle Underground Tour with Gael in Pioneer Square. Most of Seattle burned down in 1889. She did a wonderful continuous "one-liner" schtick about the history of Seattle while walking through the bowels of the city. Fascinating!

I used my SPG points since I have a few of them being a gold member and all. You'd think that would get you some free perks. I was expecting free breakfast. Wrong. Ok, maybe free crib... wrong again. Free microwave for warming baby bottles... wrong again $30 a night. Free parking... nope, add $33.xx a night. Ok at least it's a free night... nope, wrong again... they have the nerve to charge me $56 a night for the option to use my points for a "free night". So my so called "free nights" ended up costing me over $200. You'd think they'd mention the $56 a night charge for the free nights up front when booking the room or AT LEAST when checking in. Nope, not until you get the bill. Is this even legal? Bill someone without mentioning a price beforehand? We'll see how well my credit card company agrees with this disputed charge. One last thing, if you plan to stay here, have a pocket full of singles to tip every employee who touches your bag or car. These are the sorts of things you don't count on when making a booking. In cases like this you may be better off staying outside of town and using Priceline.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR113315297">My wife and I stayed here for one night.

I work in a hotel myself so I know what good customer service is supposed to be but this whole experience was awful! I booked this hotel on Hotwire - a site where you don't see the hotel name until after you book - and I initially booked because of its location (which I must say is good). Because I had booked online I called this hotel to add a request to the reservation and was transferred to 5 different people! Once I managed to speak to someone in reservations I was spoken to very rudely ("I dont assign the actual rooms M'am! I can't help you"). The guest service agents we checked in with were very polite but the room itself had walls that were so thin I could hear every single word that the guest in the room next door was saying. I called the desk to ask that someone please solve the problem and they sent someone to ask the guest to quiet down but it wasn't as if the guest was being loud - they were just talking. But because the walls were so thin it was like they were in our room with us! I had to call the desk twice to complain and even then I didn't get any sleep until 3am! At checkout (which like a previous guest said takes at least 30 minutes) I spoke with a guest service agent about the issue and she disregarded me as if I hadn't even said anything. I told her that I had the worst sleep I had ever had (and I have a 3 month old son!) and she didn't comment or ask about the issue. Needless to say I was not impressed with the way they treat their guests and will never stay at this Sheraton (or any other) ever again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108479217">We stayed here when we came to see the musical "Mary Poppins" at the Paramount Theatre. The location was very convenient - only a couple blocks away and several restaurants to choose from located between the hotel and theatre. We spent such little time in our hotel room or the hotel - I can't even comment on the tv or other amenities of the hotel. Hotel and hotel room was clean. The beds were comfortable. The price for parking was steep - but I understand that is the going rate for Seattle downtown hotels. When we returned to our hotel room at 11:30 to go to bed - one of the rooms was quite loud and keeping us up. I phoned the front desk and they promptly took care of it. As I could here the staff talking to the guests I must add they handled it in a most professional manner. Check-in for us was smooth and quick. BUt I did notice a line had formed behind me when I was done checkin in and there was only 1 staff member doing "regular" check-ins - so those guest may have had to wait. No wait at check-out as I had no reason to visit the front desk at check out.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR107824885">This hotel is located walking distance away from Pike's Market and other downtown sites and is attached to Seattle's conference facility. The hotel is reasonably well maintained and has a lovely widescreen game in the lobby which caught my kids' eyes immediately. However, I also chose this hotel for its advertised amenities i.e. swimming pool and hot tub, which were never available because the hotel was continuously full and the amenities were not sufficient for this number of people. I also waited in line to check out for at least a half hour since there was one woman on reception at 11:30 in the morning (when check-out is midday). So, the hotel is lovely, although the rooms could be better maintained, the water pressure in the bathroom was weak to put it mildly and clearly the service level does not match their room occupation levels.

There was nothing wrong with the hotel - I just wasn't wowed (except for the gym, which was great). This was a weekend getaway with my sister and I chose the hotel primarily for its convenient location and its gym. 5* for both. This is a great location for city sightseeing on foot. I paid to upgrade to the Club level, and the upgrade was a good value for the two of us in terms of perks (lounge access, continental breakfast and evening snacks for two) and free internet access. It didn't, however, seem to translate into anything special in terms of the room we were allocated. We were on a Club Floor, but the look of the hallways and our own room was very ordinary. Beige, beige, tan, beige, blah. While the room and halls seemed to be in good repair and clean, the style/decor was rather outdated. Also, while I certainly wasn't expecting the Four Seasons or the Ritz, I did expect a little more in terms of quality/luxury in a Club room. As others have mentioned, the wait for an elevator can be quite long. At one point, there seemed to be only a single elevator serving floors 20 and above in our tower, at a point where many people were checking out in the late morning after the Anime convention. Would I stay here again or recommend it to others? Maybe. Someone trying to stick with his/her fitness routine on a business trip or weekend away? - absolutely yes.

One of the two beds in the room looked like it had already been slept in before we arrived. The covers were wrinkled. And the bathroom sink wasn't clean. 3. House keeping apparently forgot about cleaning our room. We talked with housekeeping as we left for the day -- but at 4:30 pm we returned to find our room hadn't been cleaned. A call to housekeeping resulted in quick (if minimal) action -- but the call shouldn't have been necessary in the first place! 4.

We were thrilled with the location and impressed with the actual hotel. It was beautiful. Our rooms were modern, clean and comfortable. We ate at the Daily Grill (attached to the hotel) a couple of times and we really enjoyed it. The staff, from the valet to the hotel desk clerk to the bellboy etc., were all friendly, professional and courteous. We were within walking distance to the market, Westlake Centre and other major shopping (Macy's, Nordstroms, Niketown), monorail station, theatres, Cheesecake Factory, etc. The only downside was that we originally chose this hotel because of the heated pool since that would be the highlight for the kids. However, it was very cold. We could only stand it for a very limited time until we had to sit in the hot tub and warm up for a while. We spoke to guest services and asked if they could check it but they insisted that it was checked often and that it was heated to 82 degrees. Well, if it was, it didn't feel like it. The workout room was really nice and looked state of the art. Had lots of equipment and seemed like a great place for a great workout. If you are going to use the workout room, pool and hottub often, I would suggest staying in the Pike St. tower which would be more convenient, although the short walk from the Union Street Tower was fine. We would definitely stay here for future Seattle trips.

I found this a little dishonest and unsavory as the clerk could have gave us the king bed. I think the front desk staff saw the opportunity that we were a couple checking in on a cheap rate and made us choose to capitalize on making the extra $20. other than these check-in shenanigans, the hotel, the room and location were great for the price we paid. Parking was $33 plus parking tax = $41 but i was aware of this and was ok with it.

It is within 5 minutes walking distance to Pacific Plaza, Macy's, and a heap of other department stores and retailers such as Banana Republic, Nike, Levi's etc. The lobby of the hotel is very bright and elegant. The front desk spans more than 10 metres and has several counters but there is a lack of staff at all stations - the front desk, concierge and bellman. Only one person worked at the front desk checking-in/checking-out more than 5 or 6 clients. The line was long and there was no one else to help; check-in was slightly slow and delayed. Furthermore, I visited the concierge and bellman desk but there was never any staff there to assist me - it became quite frustrating. What I found even more surprising was that the front desk, the concierge and bell man were not able to offer guests the facility to make any external phone calls (even toll-free calls) from their desk telephones because the telephones were only capable of in-house and emergency calls. Instead, they asked me to use the public pay telephones on level 2. The corridor in which the 3 pay telephones were situated was dark; I was slightly concerned of my safety especially since the whole floor was so empty. Another example of poor service was the lack of complimentary umbrellas. Unlike many other hotels such as the Fairmont and the Hyatt, this Sheraton did not offer any complimentary umbrellas. When I asked the gentleman on the guest services line, he just directed me to purchase one at their gift store. I found this rather annoying, especially when I was only going to be Seattle for one night and since it was pouring outside. I just settled without an umbrella. However, there are many positive points. The room was quite spacious, albeit that some of the furnishings and furniture are old (e.g. the light switches). There are tea/coffee making facilities as well as an in-room safe, but internet is not complimentary in the room. One must go down to the lobby to use free internet. I discovered that the Business Centre on level 2 is open 24 hours. Internet usage on their touch-screen computers - which I'm using right now - is free and printing is free - this is really convenient.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR90048583">I stayed at this property back in May for some rest and relaxation in what I thought was a nice hotel. At check-in, the staff was friendly, but once a problem arose, no one wanted to hear it. The problems began with being walked in on (Yes, my Do no Disturb sign WAS on the door, as the cocky desk manager argued with me... I think his name is Eric?) by the cleaning person at 9 in the morning. I brushed it off, for I didn't want to ruin my trip. Just as I was getting back to sleep, ANOTHER cleaning person pounded down the door (YES, th DND sign was STILL on the door!) asking to clean the room. I asked them to come back later. But the icing on the cake was the minibar attendant who, at 10 am, did not knock, did not even announce themselves, walked right into my room as I was dressing!! I jumped back in surprise and his response was, and I quote " just one minute ma'am, I have to check the minibar." Um, EXCUSE ME? Since when is it ok to enter without knocking and then continue on with your business while i'm half naked? The language barrier excuse would not even explain this! Feeling completely violated, I called the manager, Eric, who could not even find time to leave his office and come to my room. He lazily offered a 50 dollar credit and could have cared less!! I will never reccomend this place!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR88856825">This is a great hotel and love to stay here when going down to Seattle to shop. It is steps away from the shopping district , Nordstroms, and Pike Place Market. It's clean, comfortable, and located in a safe area of town. I have no problems walking back to the hotel at night by myself. If you book through Priceline you can get some killer deals....anywhere from $65-$85 a night. Standard prices are from $185 a night so it is well worth it to try on Priceline. Only negative comment I have about this place is the last time we stayed here there was a dog in the next room(dog friendly hotel) whose owners were out past 3AM...The dog could hear us in the next room and was scratching at the door and whimpering all night. I called down to the desk twice before security came up and took the dog with them. I love dogs, however, didn't get much sleep that night, and tfront desk didn't seem to take my complaint seriously when I called them...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR80820587">I never write reviews of hotels, but wanted to share that while hotel location is great, it lacks in a few other areas. I'll start off saying the lobby is very nice, staff is great, Daily Grill restaurant in hotel is good. Where it lacked was in the cleanliness of the room and other services. Room smelled musty and carpet was dirty. Air conditioner clanked when fan on low and medium. Internet connection (via wireless and ethernet cable) sucked. Attended a conference in hotel, heard loud drilling throughout sessions (renovation of ice/vending areas in progress). Went from Seattle to Chicago where I stayed in at a differnet chain's property and the comparison was vastly better.

Nice staff, great location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR77431111">My husband and I and our 2 1/2-year-old daughter stayed here while my husband attended a convention, so it was semi-leisure, semi-business travel. The room was nice, and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever stayed in. The location is walking distance from the Pike Place Market and Waterfront. Parking is $33/day--probably pretty standard for downtown Seattle, but good to know. What really irked me was that internet access in your room costs $11/day! I don't do any business travel, and these days we use rental houses and condos when we travel, so perhaps this is the trend. But this seemed a very chintzy touch for such a nice hotel. It was hard to research fun activities to do with my two-year-old without internet in the room (luckily, chasing pigeons on the waterfront and visiting the Aquarium are plenty fun for her). Also, the flat-screen TV was standard-definition (not something I care about, but my husband does), and took a long time to turn on, and the "guide" was difficult to use--it was generally poor quality. Lest I sound nit-picky (and I realize I do as I read over this), I guess the reason I have these complaints is that the Sheraton is a nice hotel--maybe not luxury, but one that caters to people who are willing and able to spend a little more. This type of place was definitely a splurge for us and convenient to my husband's convention location. I'm happy in a basic motel or hut on the beach (as long as there's a beach). When we stay at the Sleep Inn I don't expect room service, and when we stay somewhere like the Sheration I don't need pillow menus or fluffy robes--just no cheaping out on the little and big details!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR76974665">My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle from August 19 - 21, 2010 for our anniversary. We had a nice room on the 24th floor of the Pike Tower. I was a little nervous at first because of all the reviews that the Pike Tower wasn't as nice as the Union Tower, but I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was nice, clean and had a wonderful city view. Yes, the decor probably isn't as nice as the newly renovated Union Tower rooms, but it is still nice. The location was great and so close to many great restaurants. My favorite place to eat has always been the Wild Ginger on the corner of Union and 3rd and this hotel is located just a short walk away. I'd stay here again and I'd be happy to stay in the Pike Tower again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR76736129">I must say that when we pulled up to the Sheraton hotel, it looked very impressive. you're immediately amazed at the beautiful lobby and the front desk people were very nice. I had sent an email requesting a room with a king size bed in the Union Tower (after reading a previous review on here), and was nicely surprised to learn that they had made the accomodation for us. We arrived late Friday night and just wanted to go up to our room. We got into our room and of course checked things out. Everything was clean and the bed looked comfy. The bathroom was modern but quite small. The door of the bathroom didn't lock properly which we called down to hotel services and they said that it would be fixed. We left to do some sightseeing and hoped that this "problem" would be rectified but it didn't seem that it was. We stayed in our hotel for 4 days total and I must say that our bed linens were only changed once while we were there ( i noticed this "change" on Monday which was our second last stay since there was a distinctive "mark" on the lower corner of the bed). a hotel of this price and excellence of quality, it seems quite odd that something so simple as changing linens wouldn't be a considered "standard". Staying in this hotel, you are paying a little bit more than other hotels in the area but its mainly because of the location. we were close to everything (pike place market, monorail, shopping) so just be aware that you're paying for this and yet the service is just the same as others. We weren't blown away by any means but still enjoyed our time in Seattle (thanks to all the fun attractions and sights that we saw). I highly recommend going to the specialty's cafe and bakery for delicious breakfast sandwichs (only a block away from hotel). It is a better alternative to the fact that the hotel doesn't offer continental breakfast. I think that we might consider staying at the sheraton again but only if we got a good deal on prices online (we booked with a travel agent).

This hotel is very easy to get to from the airport. We took the light rail from Sea Tac to the furthest point - Westlake Station. Took about a half hour and it made about 10 stops. Very easy! Got off at Westlake Station and you come out on Pine Street. Turn left and walk up 6th and the Sheraton is right there. We were on the 26th floor so fairly quiet - room was on the smaller side with two double beds. We are Starwood Preferred Guests but weren't put on the Starwood Preferred floor - don't know if this is because of the request for double beds? We used the pool and also the business center. The pool was nice - on the highest floor (35th), had bathrooms and a changing room as well as towels. Business center was also nice and they had someone there if you had any computer/printing problems. I've complained before about the charge by high end hotels for internet service in your room and this one is no exception. $10.95/24 hours. Rip off but if you'd like it's free downstairs in the lobby, at one of the godzillion Starbucks or of course McDonalds. So you do have other options. All in all, really enjoyed our stay and the beds were great. Love how convenient it was to Pike Market, the monorail, Westlake station and with a granddaughter - SHOPPING!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72620493">My wife and I were taking a romantic mini-vacation earlier this month. We booked through Hotwire and then phoned 3 times to ensure we got a king bed, which we were assured we would get, however upon arrival were informed that the king bed rooms were all booked for a convention and that we were in a 2 twin bed room, and reminded that when you book through a 3rd party such as Hotwire, your room choice is not guaranteed. We spent the first night in the 2 twin bed room, not so romantic. I went to registration the next morning and again asked for a king bed room, but was reminded that when you book through a 3rd party such as Hotwire, your room choice is not guaranteed. The only king bed room in the hotel was a junior suite and the clerk offered it to us for an additional $50 a night. I agreed and she said they would call our room when the room was ready. They called our room 3 hours after they said they would to say our room was ready and they would drop the key by our old room. Then the bell captain called and said they were too busy, so please stop by the bell desk, not great service in my mind. We got the key from the bell desk and went to "our" new room, only to find that the room was still occupied, and there was a child asleep on the bed!!! We went down to the desk and explained the situation and they gave us the key the actual correct room. They did agree to waive the $50 per night upcharge, but it is unbelievable to me that they would give us the key to someone else's room! The junior suite sucked, it was dated and had no bathtub. The Starwood suite was above us, which had a hardwood floor that someone in high heels started stomping around on at 6:30 every morning, and then someone else was moving furniture or something after midnight one night. All in all, I have to say how completely disappointed and unhappy we were with the staff and the service they provided us. We have used 3rd party booking engines before, and in every instance were treated just like any other guest. The fact that I was reminded on numerous occasions that we booked through a 3rd party service provider was offensive and an obvious mask for the fact that the staff were unwilling and unable to provide anything near good service.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72328268">Thanks to another Tripadvisor review, my wife and I redeemed ourselves for at least one night of our stay this past weekend. We booked through Starwood based on the location and ability to use points. Arrived to be placed in the Pike Tower-- 22nd floor. After hearing of renovations, we opened the door to a less than average room. We were very angry to find out-dated furnishings, mold on the bathroom ceiling above the shower (with hair on shower curtain), and a stiff king bed. Walking down the hallway even gave off a musty smell. Upon reading trip advisor Saturday evening with only one night remaining, we found out that the Union Tower was the one newly renovated, so we immediately called the front desk to change. They offered to move us and we obviously accepted. Got to the new room to find what seemed to be a completely different experience/hotel. Updated contemporary furnishings and nicer bathrooms. This was the room we expected to find when booking using several thousand Starwood Points. We expressed our frustration at the front desk upon leaving and they gave us 1000 Points back to send us on our way. That was a small consolation for being left in the dark for 2 days of our romantic getaway. Next time, we'll try the Four Seasons Seattle-- which was booked full or we would have moved. Pool was nice... just filled with KIDS KIDS KIDS. Could not relax there at all.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72200807">4,3,2,1 -- I rate the Sheraton a 2.

One is actually very new, modern, clean and comfortable. That's the Union St. Tower. Then you have its horrendous sister, Pike Tower, which they actually shouldn't be selling whatsoever. The decor, carpet, furnishings and the like are at least 15 years old (I got some inside information) and a Holiday Inn is going to be more up to date. Cheap, worn beds with even cheaper headboards that creak and pop--there's nothing sweet about sleeping here in the Pike Tower. The Union Tower is recommended and you get what you're paying for. Of course, Starwood isn't going to tell you this; luckily Tripadvisor is here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR71560147">I have a hard time sleeping anywhere but home.

The help was very friendly and courteous. When my teenagers didn't answer their wake up call security arrived at their room to make sure they were OK.

The room was large, quiet, and comfortable, by urban hotel standards. The staff was friendly and accomodating and the hotel also boasts a nice gym and pool. A nice touch was their collection of the beautiful glasswork by Seattle artist Dale Chihouly. One of the hotel staff was happy (and proud) to show me his work. Photographs were also in my room. The hotel's location was perfect for walking to Pikes Place Market and other local attractions. There are some excellent coffee houses, eateries, and shopping areas close to, around, and in the area (especially the Market). Quick, inexpensive massages are available in the Seattle Convention Center, only one block away. Please note that the hotel is in the business district of Seattle. As a female travelling alone, after dark, I was more comfortable walking close to the hotel. There are several good restaurants within a block or two, including the hotel's restaurant, the Daily Grill. Re negatives: the room rates were predictably expensive, on par with other urban hotels I have visited. The room was also absent small, but important amenities such as an in-room refrigerator and free in-room Internet service. I paid the extra fee for in-room Internet and had no problem with connections, however. Overall, if I had reason to come to Seattle again, I would stay here because of its location, the comfortable accomodations, and the friendly staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR70027777">I booked this hotel because a friend told me it was in a great location.

The guy could of not cared that I was coming to stay no hello or how can I help you, I thought that at least he would help with the bags. When it came to check in it was the same service.

We like to rent a car during the duration of our vacations just in case we decide to leave town on a last minute trip but we opt out because of the valet parking fee. If we did needed a car to rent, there are two rental company that are 1 1/2 block away from hotel; so it was no big deal for us. There is a public parking across the street for less price but of course no in/out privilege. The hotel does not have firm pillow, so we requested more pillows to compensate for the lack of height / firmness which worked out. As for the sheets, it was simply noisy as everyone said. This is something we've never come across starwood properties before. However, we knew of this issue before booking by reading tripadvisor's reviews. As starwood members, we used cash and points to stay here for seven nights at $60 per night. Similar to what most people on this board get on Priceline. We were traveling as family of three with a nine month old who's a good sleeper. During check in we asked if they have a suite with separate bedroom as an upgrade to avoid waking up the baby while my husband is on his laptop for work. The suite cost too much for our pockets and instead we were offered a $15 upgrade room per night that does offer a little privacy for the baby. It was a corner room at the new remodeled building (est. 3 yrs ago) which has a large closet section where the crib fits perfectly without blocking the closet door and away enough from the working desk. The baby had her own view of the city. There is also a tall shelves that we utilized for the baby supplies. See photos. The up grade corner room was great for the little... it kept her busy looking at the vehicles and people passing by on the street. We also needed a fridge for the baby's food and we were given the key to the bar fridge. We just moved some bottles around and made enough room for the little one's homemade food. The hotel also offer high chair to make those solid food feeding much easier. Most important to us is an inroom safebox which they do have in all rooms. We did not hear our neighbor though walls but you can hear door closing from other guests. However, in the hotel's defense, guests around us does not realize how loud they closed their doors. Speaking of noise, we were on the 14th floor and you can hear the street noise... not too much but for someone who comes from a very quiet area, there were noise. The fan in the bathroom also is On 24 hrs and we closed the bathroom door at night to cut down the fan noise. We did grew into both noises during our stay and our baby wasn't bothered at all by either one. We did not use the hotel pool. We did visit the pool area and at the time there were only two kids playing, and that was around 3pm on a wednesday. It's not always busy as other reviewers states. The place looked cleaned including the restroom and changing rooms. We did use the business center to use their printer for dinning coupon. When logging on from their computers, use your last name and room number... a great way to keep only hotel guests from using the business center. Outside the hotel, we had everything we needed for the baby's comfort. We went to Cheesecake Factory (1 short block) to meet a friend for dinner. Cheesecake Factory if kids friendly; they gave use complementary bread and cut up banana for the baby and it was given to us right after we were seated. Walgreens was I think 2-3 blocks towards the Pike Market. Children's Museum was two blocks walk to the monorail from the hotel. The only thing Sheraton Seattel is lacking is in-house spa service. I think even though this hotel is market to mostly business travelers for the convention, a spa service would be a treat to all guests including those hard working conference attendees. A nitpicking... it would handy to have a restaurant listing and activity center directions that are near by the hotel available in the guests room book information. Going to the concierge seems to be a waist of time to get this information. Tips for those who are budget conscious: The hotel food cost way too much for breakfast. Across the entrance from Sheraton (where cars arrive), there is a mall. At the second floor you will find a small store that sell danish. The building also has Starbucks coffee which I believe cost less than the Sheraton's cafe. Get your snacks, drinks, etc. at Walgreens to save some money. Overall we would stay here again for our next visit because of the customer service, location and... because they are one of three hotels in Seattle that offer swimming pool. I believe our little one will be able to enjoy the swimming pool by the time we visit Seattle again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR67850729">So far the worst hotel my boyfriend and I have ever stayed despite all the mostly good reviews and the 4 stars we saw when we bought our Seattle vacation package. We came from a late evening flight and finally arrived at our hotel around 2am welcomed by $40-$50 parking rates, the smell of mildewy shower curtains, and pungent b.o. emanating from our sheets. We waited 20 min for housekeeping to arrive with clean sheets. Throughout the weekend however we kept smelling the odor off and on and we finally figured out it was coming from the comforter which was making everything else smell. The next morning I left a note for housekeeping to change the shower curtains. What they did instead was leave the new curtain and liner on our bed along with the rings... so we're supposed to hang them ourselves? We made another call and right away a man came by to hang the curtain for us. He explained there was a mis-communication and the curtains were laid there for someone else to hang but he/she never got the communication.

The staff is friendly and helpful, and the rooms are nice. Based on prior reviews, I did ask for a room in the Union Street Tower (the new tower) and was happy with my room. It was spacious and had a small seating area. Bathroom was fine and having a little desk was helpful. Only complaint: the bed is only sort of comfortable, and the pillows are not great. Also, the repeated complaint that this hotel nickel and dimes you for things is true (charges for toll-free calls, charge for internet access in the room, expensive valet charge.) I got my reservation on Hotwire for around $200 total (plus taxes) for two nights, so it was a good bargain and, therefore, worth the sleep disappointment.

The wired internet costs $10.95 per day which is not unlike any other business hotels that I've stayed in, so that's completely fine...but no wireless is not fine. In addition, I paid full price for my room which was to be between floors 5 to 30, and I got a room on floor 6. I know I'm nit-picking....but aren't rooms on lower floors typically assigned for those who paid a discounted price for their room? Lastly, I found a strand of hair (not from someone's head...but from some other region of the body which I will not explicitly state here) on my bathroom sink!

We wanted to get a luggage cart to carry our bags. Nope, only the staff can use them. We shut the outer door to our two rooms and couldn't open it with our key. When we asked about it at the front desk, the snotty desk clerk said that we weren't supposed to close the door. Really? Where was that sign??? It takes FOREVER to get service. When we finally got our bags out of holding, the bell hop HAD to take them to our car. He did not help put them in the car and yet he was ticked off when I didn't tip him. Sorry pal, where I come from...you ONLY get a tip when you provide good service. AWFUL RUDE STAFF!!!!! Get it together Seattle Sheraton! Only redeeming qualities...location and pretty clean rooms.

That word would be â€œlagomâ€� and it translates into something like â€œso-soâ€� or â€œnot good, but not bad eitherâ€� I spent one week at this hotel and there are definitely both good and bad sides that I could highlight. Like many others have pointed out the location is perfect. Right down town just a few minutesâ€™ walk from Pikes Market, Nordstrom, Macys and a handful of good restaurants including Cheesecake Factory across the street. There is also a Gameworks and movie theaters across the street and if you like video games and are in town on a Thursday you should go there after 9 where you can get unlimited gaming from 9 to midnight for 10 dollars. The reception area is nice; the hotel restaurant is nice and serves good food in huge portions for the right price. I also enjoyed a very well equipped gym with plenty of cardio and weight workout where you can have a run while enjoying a nice view from the top floor of the hotel. Staff was friendly, but nothing other than what you would expect in a hotel in this. The room was ok size (in the smaller range for a US hotel room, but big compared to European standards) and the bed was nice and there was good water pressure in the shower. The room looked and felt outdated with older style furniture and decorations with plenty of visible signs that it had been around for a while. The hotel is a non smoking hotel, but every time I entered the room I could smell a ligt smell of cigarette smoke that I would presume is from back when the hotel had smoking rooms. When I checked in I was asked if I wanted the key to the mini-bar. Something I said yes to, but I found out that the mini-bar was never refilled during the week I stayed there. This hotel has plenty of potential, but definitely needs a refurbish.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR57544666">nice hotel, great location, good rates, would stay in again<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR56990144">I only wanted to let you know, that this hotel is simply perfect!

It was a little pricey for an older hotel that didn't seem as nice as its counterparts across the street (eg: Red Lion).

I went with my good friend for a weekend getaway and to check out some clubs in seattle. The hotel was perfectly located where we didnt have to take our car out of valet for any reason; walking distance to shopping center, pikes place and the monorail which takes you to the space needle. a valet for 2 cost more than the room itself as i paid $70 a night via pay your own price. With parking it resulted in the room being about $105.00 per night, which is still a great steal for the location and quality of hotel. I would have paid out more if I stayed at a hotel further from the city center and had to pay parking fees downtown. The lobby is gorgeous, but, the rooms remind me of a 3 star hilton..which is fine for me. I believe this hotel is primarily 4-star because of the location and restaurants located within. The pool is not 24 hour which was a little disappointing as my friend and i wanted to take a swim after clubbing one night, but it was alright. oveall a fabulous hotel! :) Very Comfortable and clean and definetely worth the pay your own price! :)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR54290747">Centrally located sterile and boaring hotel with bad service.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR54259136">We got a rate of $85/night on Priceline (in December) so value for money was excellent. We had a fabulous stay at the Sheraton. No complaints about anything. The fitness room is great - lots of equipment so not waiting around at all. It's adjoining the pool so well located for a run and then a swim. One of the best features was the bed - it was very firm and comfortable. The sheets were a bit odd, they were like paper. We went for a shopping weekend and it was an excellent location for that, a block and a half to Nordstrom's! The only slight downside was there was no wi-fi in the rooms and you had to either pay $12 a day or go to the lobby for free wi-hi. It amazed us that a large hotel wouldn't have free wi-fi in the rooms. We also had to request robes which was a bit odd as well but housekeeping was quick to bring them up. Perhaps this had to do with their green strategy. If you don't need your towels washed daily, you get a choice of starwood points or a coupon for the coffee shop downstairs. Great idea! Head to Speciality's Cafe &amp; Bakery for the best breakfast sandwich and latte (only a block away). If we got another excellent price on Priceline, we would absolutely stay here again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR52965742">What a disappointment. Its location is really one of the only redeeming qualities about this massive hotel. I was even given a room in the "Starwood Preferred Guest" floor, but it was definitely nothing to write home about. Everything looked and felt outdated.

The first 5 nights we stayed at the Hotel Vintage Park on 5th Avenue, and switched for one night to be at a conference held in the Sheraton. The Vintage Park was a far better experience for about 1/2 the price. The rooms at the Sheraton are top-notch: large, clean, comfortable, everything you would expect. The hotel is beautiful though a little difficult to navigate. My problems were with Internet access and the help desk. I tried to log in using the ethernet cable provided. No dice. I ended up talking to an off-site tech support guy for 30 minutes before giving up. And wireless internet, if I wanted to use it, would have been $12/day. Seriously, $12/day for something as standard as wireless internet. My other complaint was the staff. I asked one when to get the airport shuttle and was told 5:58 AM. I come the next morning and ask a different person who says no shuttle until 6:15. Huh? I wait outside anyway. The guy outside says the shuttle will pull right up. It didn't, instead stopping on the street. Even though nobody was around and there was a staffperson 10 feet from me, he didn't move to tell me the shuttle was there and certainly didn't bother to help with the 3 heavy bags I was toting. All in all, this hotel didn't seem worth the cost. The Vintage Park was much friendlier, with effortless internet connection and fast, courteous staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR51404985">had a 3 day weekend in Seattle for Xmas shopping and this place was excellent. some minor points I did not realize: 1) valet parking is mandatory and is about 32$ a day. it is easy and their were plenty of valets. longest we had to wait was 15 minutes though which leads me to my 2nd comment 2) this is absolutely a CONFERENCE hotel. each day we were there conference people were checking in and checking out, so this made long lines to ask questions or to check in or out directly. the large number of people entering and leaving made getting the car an adventure, so I suggest calling down to have your car brought out if possible. 3)gym is on top floor, right next to one of their ballrooms. it was open to the air so when we got off the elevator it was freezing from wind, and people in VERY nice party/wedding attire we next to us on elevator with us in stinky workout stuff. should have separate elevator or dressing room to change. for the bright spots, the location was perfect. right next to the conference center, movie theater, food, niketown, and pacific place and other great shopping spots. mostly the staff was friendly, from the valets to the bell boys. room was clean and spacious, we initially had a low floor corner room (larger than middle rooms) but got upgraded to a higher floor but toward the middle of hotel ( view was better and they try to keep families with kids on floors 20 and down). exercise room was great and the view was incredible from top floor. liked the express elevators for floors 20 and up. down sides. 1) hot tub was same temperature as the cold pool 2) when I was 1st checking in, I gave my ID and Credit card to the front desk to check me in then I went to front door to tell wife we could check in early, when I came back (less than a minute) she had walked away from the desk and had left my ID and card on desk for anyone could have grabbed it...not happy. (they did check us in early though) 3)wife asked conceirge question about the rail to the space needle, she answered with a snide remark and didn't bother to give my wife a full answer until she prompted her. not very service like 4)pool area was covered with used towels from earlier users..it was late at night but as was a mess. the bad points were minor compared to the location and nice atmosphere in the hotel.

The beds and pillows were excellent...and I have a bad back and hips but had NO problems at all. The location of this hotel makes up for the pricing and parking...It is surrounded with all kinds of shopping and there is a HUGE, excellent, and very affordable selection of food/restaurants at the Westlake Center which is about two blocks away. This center is a stop for the Monorail which will take you to the Seattle Center. There are also wonderful shops at the mall. We aren't shoppers but the atmosphere and the large variety of shops surrounding the hotel, including the close proximity of Pike Place Market and the Piers make this hotel a jewel.

However, as an independent traveller, I was disappointed by the brusque attitude at check-in, and then by the room itself, which looked a bit dated. We were on the Club level, which includes both breakfast and hors d'oeuvres in the Club Lounge - again, disappointing from the perspective of how very busy it was, with guests often waiting for a seat, and the dirty windows (a lot of bird poop) which need to be cleaned more regularly. The food served, however, was good. Back in the room, the walls are quite thin and we had to call down to reception more than once to ask them to get our neighbours to quieten down.

Location pretty central, shopping areas and market by the shore within walking reach, next to the financial district so pretty tranquil. Checked in too early and could not get a room, once returned to the desk, had to queue again and do most of the checking anew though promised a simple key fetch so was disappointed at that point.

All of the hotels, including the lodge we stayed at in Tofino, B.C., were clean, convenient, and comfortable. We had booked two nights at the Seattle Sheraton through Priceline. We arrived at about 2:30 PM and informed that no room with a king bed was available and that because we had booked through a third party, no room or type of bed could be expected. We were given a room with two double beds. We were also informed that our room would not be ready for at least an hour and that the parking fee was 39.00 per night. The published check-in time was 3:00 PM and we were finally allowed to check in about 4:00 PM. The carpet was stained and dirty. Perhaps this is what must be expected by booking through Priceline, but I would suggest that any hotel chain with any integrity, would provide a decent room to any customer. We were left with the feeling that Sheraton was taking advantage of people and nickel and dimeing them. This experience has convinced me of two things - I will not use Priceline and I will not stay at a Sheraton again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34792260">All of the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.

The room was small-to-average, and the beds were comfy. Staff was pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary in a positive or negative way. The city view was nice, and the pool on the 35th floor had a nice view of some nesting eagles on a nearby building. The pool, however, had a very strong smell of chlorine, and I suspect the chemical balance was off the day we used it. The best part about the stay was the single-serve Starbucks coffee maker in the room, and the easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and public transportation. The worst was feeling nickel-and-dimed on the parking (valet only, approx. $45/day when fees &amp; tips are included), and the internet ($9.95/day for a service that I feel should be free). Also, the television was typcial of the hotels that vend movies these days - impossible to determine current program listings, because the only menu keeps spitting you out at the movies for purchase. While I know these practices are typical of many upscale hotel establishments, I have stayed at many that don't make you feel that their private motto is "whatever the market will bear". This was not one of those.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR33104139">The Sheraton Hotel was everything we expected it to be.

What a great location...we were within a short walking distances to all the tourist attractions....many wonderful restaurants were close by. If you needed transportation....it was pretty much everywhere you looked. Plenty of buses, cabs, tour buses in every which way.

The room, on the concierge floor (or one of them), was large with a good view. Resto, bar areas were enjoyable with fine food/drink. The common areas such as these, plus the main lobby is constantly jammed: the convention centre is less than a block away and conventions are obviously a large source of business here...usually three lines to check in each about 15-20 deep every afternoon. Our biggest problem was we needed the internet and the Sheraton's system (newly installed we were told) kept going offline..either the part where you had to identify yourself as a guest (and thus get free internet service) or the whole internet feed itself (the last three days we were there). Staff seemed to have no idea when anything would be fixed..just that IT was working on it. Loads of complaints voiced loudly in the bar area!! The concierge lounge was too small given the number of business travellers trying to use it, and the waitstaff keep the coffee and soft drinks hidden away, then bring them out to you with a piece of paper asking for your name, room and place to indicate a tip. Unlike most hotels of this level, coffee/tea/softdrinks were not available outside of lounge meal times. Despite a sign outside the lounge blocking children from entering (at all not just at drink times), breakfasts had screaming kids and one day at drinks a child was present. Really inappropriate we thought. So a good stay if you're at a convention, but shop elsewhere if just touring: Seattle is on the small side with good transportation so other hotels are equally or more convenient--although we did enjoy the rooftop glass enclosed pool.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR31063639">We stayed in the new Union Tower which has beautiful, spacious rooms with excellent amenities.

A devoted Starwood member, I have always understood Westins to be of higher calibres than Sheratons. In this comparison, it's exactly the opposite. Huge and beautifully appointed, the Sheraton Seattle is at the center of everything; Nordstrom, Niketown, City Centre mall, Pacific Place mall and a very short, straight walk to Pike Place Market. If you don't feel like leaving the hotel, the gym is AMAZING and the pool quite inviting - I wished I had brought my suit. Of the two towers, ask to stay on the renovated side. As a Platinum Starwood member, I enjoyed a generous, delicious spread each morning for breakfast in the Club Lounge and cocktails each evening. Hotel also features a convenience store shop to buy sandwiches and light fare, as well as an attached restaurant, the Daily Grill (although ridiculously priced), and a gift shop.

I'm sure there are nicer sections of the hotel...perhpas we stayed in the older version, I'm not sure, but I'm glad I used priceline and didn't pay full price. One more complaint...the pool is on the 35th floo with beautiful views, but there were only 4 chairs. If you want to take your kids swimming, there's never a place to sit because people claim one of the 4 chairs. I mean, come on...nice pool, but 4 chairs?

Bathroom: the usual shampoo, body wash and conditioner--no shower cap. 2. The mini bar: No refrigerator, just a small ice bucket; and a basket of overpriced goodies. 3. One of the things I look for is a whirlpool (jacuzzi, spa, whatever you want to call it). The Sheraton's did not work. I called downstairs. Someone came up and fooled around with a broken treadmill, but did not come near the spa, probably because it needs professional attention and the hotel doesn't want to spend the money. 4. In general, the service was generally very good, but the room service??? Can you believe $10 per mediocre pancake? And to add insult to injury, they charge you $3.50 to deliver it!, plus the tip.! 5. The decor is so-so, with some scribbly, slap-dash prints adorning the walls and the carpets and wallpaper just a bit shy of the standard I'd expect for this price.

We were in the older tower, so the decor could use a bit of updating, but I have zero complaints about the property. The location was superb - made an excellent base for exploring the city. We used the updated fitness center a couple of times to work off all the great Seattle food. We also found the boarding pass station in the lobby to be very helpful.

There was a long line, and the color printer was broken. And forget printing quickly from a thumb drive. All of this is a big negative for a hotel that hosts major conferences. The business center should open no later than 6:00 AM and stay open till at least 9:00 PM. The room itself was nice--not spectacular, but good. The beds were comfy, the coffee maker worked well, etc. Nice large HDTV, working safe, the usual amenities. Also the usual sea of business-hotel beige, but I didn't care. The staff is not overly efficient: After checking in at about 10:00 PM, we went to our room and found someone else's room service cart full of dirty dishes near our front door. It took three calls to the front desk to get this hauled away. Same when we needed the room cleaned in the afternoon (after having the privacy sign up earlier in the day). I got the impression that the front desk staff simply forwards requests to housekeeping or room service, which are not under any great pressure to do anything. There is free wi-fi but only in the first-floor lobby; it goes away when you go one floor up to where the meeting rooms are. That floor has a different, fee-based wi-fi. Same with the guest rooms: It's $10/day for cable-based Internet. The location is great, however. As others have said, you're near just about everything. Avoid walking down Pike Street, however, as you'll be pestered by panhandlers. Take Pine instead, which is parallel. Take cabs at night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR29701164">I Stayed here for more than 20 days for a business meet. Very Good hospitality and service. I loved the atmosphere and service provided.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR29351438">Beds &amp; linens here are not up to the quality we usually find at 4* hotels. Also, we asked for a queen bed, but were given a room with two doubles after being told they were only an inch smaller than a queen, but they felt much smaller. Attention to details seems missing here - we needed to look up an address, but found that the yellow pages in the room didn't cover the downtown area. Even if we'd found it, the room had no pen to write it down. Small things, but indicative. To top things off, they didn't clean our room the second day. And no wireless internet in the rooms. Overall, I'd say the hotel is no better than your average 3* hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR28976424">I stayed at the Sheraton for a convention and found it very convenient to the convention center. It also has many good shops and restaurants conveniently located. The Daily Grill is the hotel restaurant and I found it to be good. I rated the cleanliness low because upon arrival there were some peanuts, loose change, and plastic clips from the previous people which clearly didn't get cleaned up by the housestaff...merely pushed up against the armoire. That said, when I mentioned it to housekeeping, they were extremely solicitous about it. I stayed on the 8th floor next to the elevator (the hotel was packed due to the convention) but had no trouble with noise. Higher floors may have a view of the bay, since I could see it from a meeting room that was higher up then my own room. My room was spacious and the bathroom was nice. The carpet has seen better days but wasn't scary. You have to pay about $10 for cable internet, but there is free wi fi in the lobby (when will some of these better hotels realize that they should get free wireless in the rooms?). Regarding the shopping, there is an H and M, the flagship Nordstrom store, Ann Taylor, Eileen Fischer, and many other high end shops and regular stores around the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR28791053">Just finished 3 nights here for a conference &amp; overall it was very nice. Lobby is lovely, guest room spacious, &amp; bathroom, although smaller than expected, had very nice fixtures. For some reason they choose to use flat bottom sheets on the bed, vs. expected fitted, which means a knot in the middle of your back once you turn over. Desk in the guest room is very large, as is the knee cut-out; so large, in fact, that 2 of us were able to sit side-by-side quite comfortably. My aircard didn't work as well as it should have &amp; I expect the hotel has some kind of blocking system to encourage guests to use, &amp; pay for, their own internet access. The hotel's restaurant is a Daily Grill, which is actually a chain, however, the breakfast we had there was wonderful! Skip the high-priced buffet &amp; order off the menu; set breakfasts are much more reasonable &amp; the portion I rec'd was so big I couldn't finish it. Also be sure to try Palomino, across the street, for lunch or dinner at least once; very nice. The hotel is a quick, level (both ways!), 5-block walk to Pike's Market &amp; worth the trip just to see all the variety of tulips at the different flower stands.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR28412444">I stayed here with my brother for a few days. I wanted a hotel that was downtown and very central. After reading a few dodgy reviews about some of the hotels in Seattle I decided on this one as it seemed to be in a safe area of the city and had good reviews. We weren't let down. This is bang in the middle of downtown, perfect for all the things in downtown. It also wasn't on the freeway which other nearby hotels on 6th Avenue backed on to. We were on the 18th floor, there was no noise- from other rooms or corridors, or outside the hotel. It was quiet. The room was very very nice. Simple room but nicely decorated. Very clean and kept in good order. 2 massive beds, tv, clean bathroom. Minibar on offer (not that we touched it with the prices!). Staff seemed nice and helpful. It seemed very posh after having stayed in a more budget style of hotel a few days earlier, but saying that it didn't make you feel uncomfortable. It was nice. The prices were pretty reasonable considering it's a hotel at the upper end of the scale. The hotel had a little shop 'the daily grill' which sold breakfast items (croissants, hot drinks, sandwiches etc), we used this a few times, kind of expensive but useful if you're hungry and want something straight away. I would highly recommend staying here, it was very pleasant.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR26809757">We were going to attend a charity event downtown (We live in Seattle), so we thought we would get a hotel just to be able to stay downtown. We got our room off Priceline for a good price $85 for a 4 star. The problem is I would not classify this hotel (at least our room) as 4 star. There were stains on the carpet, The bathroom lights were covered in dust, the furniture was the type of furniture you would find at a Days Inn. We opened our drawers to put our clothes away and the previous guest had left food in there that was not cleaned out. When we checked out the hotel was paid for by Priceline, but they went ahead and charged my card anyway and I had to have them correct it. They don't have wireless internet and the internet in the room was super slow. Overall it was fine because we got the room for cheap and the location is great, but I wouldn't stay here if you are really expecting a nice room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26291672">We decided to use priceline.com to book a one night 4 star hotel stay in Downtown Seattle just 1 night before our departure. This was the 1st time using priceline, and we had some reservations not knowing which hotel we would get. However, we were pleasantly surprised to be awarded Sheraton Seattle for an incredible price - 40% off the lowest price advertised on spg.com website. We are Starwood preferred members and typically book directly through spg, but had thought we would try priceline after hearing so much about it. This is our 2nd stay with Sheraton Seattle, the first being several years back when the renos were in place. This time round, we were given a room in the older tower which was fine with us. The room was spacious. I loved the clarity of the TV screen. We took a look at the gym and pool facilities which looked awesome to use, but as usual did not have time to utilize. Valet parking was $38 including taxes, though expensive was considered norm in downtown. We had to wait a while for check out and valet parking to bring our car, but I guess that was the peak check out time. I guess we could have used the express check out methods to save time. Ultimately, the location was the best..close to Pike's market, Westlake Centre, and lots of shopping/stores all around the hotel.. Too bad the weather wasn't that great this weekend with the wind, rain &amp; snow .<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR26078038">I loved the hotel and it's service...but I couldn't believe we had to pay for something most other less expensive and area hotels offer for free - **WIFI**, $10/day.

Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all. In fact, we had to walk to all of our destinations because the Taxi's and Public Transportation system were not running at full capacity. We even walked to Pike's Place and the Aquarium one day and the Seattle Center another (yeah, the monorail was down also!). Still quite bearable from the Sheraton and my son thought running through all the snow was a blast. A few interesting things I noticed, lots of people smoking, and it didn't seem that most folks walking around were very friendly or courteous at all. I got the feeling that if I didn't get out of someone's way they'd walk into me. Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a "liveable" place. The room was nice and comfortable. About what you'd expect from a four star hotel. Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar. From what I understand we stayed in the newer renovated tower which is supposed to be much nicer than the other, older tower. We were nearly at the top so views, while not spectacular, weren't bad since you see above most everything other building. I'd suggest staying away from the in hotel restaurant. Quite expensive and service was mediocre. Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food. Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast. My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all! There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby. The ones we went to seemed to be quite upscale so even the food court can be a bit pricey given the type of food served. All in all a pleasant stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23166312">We originally planned to stay here before Christmas for some family time since we live in the Seattle area but due to the snow and the poor job of keeping the streets clear by the city (Mayor) we changed our reservation for the weekend after Christmas. We had a special Macy's rate and the hotel was gracious enough to change our reservation and we were able to keep the same rate which included a Macy's gift card of $100. We had a corner king room on the 19th floor in the new Union Street tower. The room was very large with a great view of the city and the water but be forewarned the corner king room does not have a king bed but a queen bed! My husband and I thought the bed (Sheraton Sweet Sleeper) was too hard and each of us woke up with back aches. We have a memory foam bed with a memory foam topper at home for comparison purposes. I was surprised the bathroom was a compact tub/shower combo with a single vanity sink. I expected a separate tub and shower for this size of room especially since this tower was recently built. They had a 32" flat screen LCD TV which was nice however the room is so large it really needs a larger TV. We couldn't read the guide on the the TV because it was so far away from the bed. I loved all the space in this room. There was a large desk area and an over sized chair with an ottoman. there was a large dressing area near the entrance to the room and still lots of room to move around. We had drinks in the lobby bar which was nice but did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. Cheesecake factory (very good) and Palominos (very bad) were right near the hotel so we ate there. The hotel did not seem very busy so I was surprised there were dishes left out in the hallway for 2 days just down the hall from us. Not a pretty sight on your way out to eat. I would stay in this hotel again in this category of room if we could get a couple of mattress toppers to soften the bed. We had a very enjoyable time in the city and the Sheraton has a great location to shopping and dining and many other things our great city offers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR23061262">My wife and I stayed here on Dec 27th 2008, taking advantage of their Macy's shop and stay package $199/night rate that came with the Macy's $100 gift card. The pros: they upgraded our room to a reasonably high floor, quiet corner room. The room was clean and the sheets were clean. The bed was comfortable. The waitstaff was very friendly. The cons: The sheets were extremely noisy - I roll over often in the night and every time I moved I woke my wife up - I even woke myself up a few times. The worst thing though was the wait-staff attempting to barge into the room at 9:30am on Sunday morning (we had the door lock across, so they did not actually get in). My wife was getting dressed. They said they knocked, but my wife was near the door and did not hear any knock - it really upset and shook her up. The knock however to me that doesn't matter. We like to sleep in - we could have been asleep and they would have walked in and woke us up. No way should anyone be entering any occupied room at 9:30am on a Sunday. Just really poor policy. I really got upset with the manager, and to his credit, he tried to make good - he gave us the parking for free and said he would add another 2500 starpoints to my starwood card. I am not so sure I would stay here again - but I think that if I were to again, I would be sure to put the do not disturb sign outside my door and let the front desk know to keep the waitstaff out until checkout.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22708545">Very good convention hotel with nice lobby and newer Union Tower in great location by tourist area and convention center. Room was particularly good for a Sheraton. Gym and pool are nice. But there is an annoying issue that gets in the way of really enjoying this hotel--they overcharge for the basic necessities of business travel. Examples are $38 per night for fairly slow valet parking (front desk has an "it's a separate company" shrug), $10 per day for internet, $5 per day to use the gym. At comparable downtown Seattle hotels at which I have also stayed, parking is under $30 per night and the internet and gym are included in the room price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR22397964">Stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 6 nights for a work-related conference and to visit family in the Seattle area.

Checking in was fast and the room was extremely well-appointed. They have a TWO-level gym on the 35th floor with astounding city views. The gym is far superior to any hotel gym I've seen with twenty aerobic machines and many free weights and benches. I got in two workouts during my overnight stay. Now for the annoying news. In this day of free hotel WI-FI, the Sheraton charges guests $9.95 per day for a hard-wired network connection. Business travelers expect free Internet these days; however, I was able to justify it because of the low room price I got, The real kicker, though, was the $10.00 "handling" fee they charged me for receiving a UPS shipment. That, in my opinion, was way out of line.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21110989">The Good: The Sheraton has a great location. The lobby is nice and large with plenty of tables and comfy chairs/sofa . Some coffee tables are interactive w/ mapping software and music. Fun for the kids to play with. The Daily Grill kwiki store in the lobby makes an OK coffee and provides some reasonably healthy breakfasts options at an OK price (eg granola yougurt parfait for $4.50). The elevators were very available and fast for our four day stay, considering we were on the 23rd floor. Big flat screen TV in the room was OK if your into TV. The Bad: The front desk originally gave us a 1 bed room when we ordered a two-bed room (this with 2 adults and 2 kids standing in front of the desk clerk). After getting our two bed room we later find that its pretty dirty. You could write your name in the dust on the lamps in the bathroom (probably the short maids can't reach that high). The carpet could use a good cleaning, if not replacing. The beds were very uncomfortable compared to most 4 star hotels I've been in. No pulbic trash cans in the ice rooms for getting rid of extra trash from the rooms. My wife tried eating a candy bar from the overpriced room stack basket only to read the label and see the expiration date was for March of 2008. Bleahh... The Interesting: The workout room is beautiful on the top floor. Unfortunately the pool was closed waiting for city permits. It really sucked having no pool, especially since we had two kids with us.

I should have known that this stay would be a disaster when they told me they would have to move me from one room to another mid-stay. In order to avoid this, I am now paying extra for my room above the printed conference rate. Well, as I write this review, I am sitting in the hotel lobby. I have been here for about two hours because my room is not ready. Granted, check-in time is supposed to be at 3:00 and I did arrive early at 1:30. However, it is now 3:00 and I have just been told that I need to wait another hour. Apparently, in this entire hotel, there is not room ready for a guest?? No effort at all from the front desk except "housekeeping is working as fast as they can." They did not have a perky response when I noted that other people are being checked into their rooms. I know because I have been here for 2 hours watching! I have not even seen the room and I already dislike this place. I will not be returning and I will also suggest that my colleagues stay elsewhere when they attend conferences or vacation in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20741980">I stayed here for a few nights on business and was fully expecting a non-descript city hotel: beige walls, stained carpeting, etc. Instead, the lobby is expansive with a long marble check-in counter and a comfy seating area that has several Microsoft Surface tables. Check in was smooth and my room in the Union Street tower was beautiful. I think I may have been in a newly renovated room, because everything was immaculate. Flat screen TV, spotless carpeting, warm colors on the walls and bed linens, big work desk, and a bathroom that had updated hardware. Very plush and comfortable. Room comes stocked with a new coffee maker and Starbucks coffee, Bliss toiletries, and daily newspaper delivery. Room service that was ordered at 7:30 pm arrived less than 30 minutes after I hung up the phone (and was pretty decent!). The gym was just renovated and has a decent selection of cardio equipment and weight machines. The pool was still closed but days away from opening.

However, pool was closed for renovation. You can use the Westin's pool (5 blocks away) or pay money to use a club. The beds are nice, but that's about it. Rooms and hallways are a bit grim and dark, and none of the drains in the bathrooms worked properly. Needed late checkout, but was told the hotel was too full, which is fine but then they magically made a room available for a few hours for $50. But the key stopped working anyway.

We were disappointed when we checked in and I asked where the pool is located to be told the pool is closed for remodeling until September or October. I had called the Starwood reservations line directly in July and asked which of the Starwood hotels in Seattle had the best pool, picked the Sheraton based on their advice, told my daughter that she could go swimming, only to find it was closed. They did tell us we could go down and use the pool at the Westin but that just seemed like a mission since we only had one full day in Seattle at the tail end of this trip. Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel. We were supposed to be on the club floor, but had been moved to the union tower as we arrived after midnight I wasnt in the mood to make a fuss. We still got club room amenities - the breakfast was great and the staff were super. We were told that the union tower rooms were newer and nicer and we did have a lovely room with two very comfy beds, a flat screen tv and a nice bathroom. There was a nice big desk area and two comfortable chairs in a seating area. The decor is quite masculine - sort of comfortable modern look I suppose but it all worked and felt really comfortable. The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating, and these neat microsoft tables that are like huge touch screens with local maps etc. They were pretty cool. The location is great, we walked down to Pike market, walked over and caught the monorail to the Space Needle. We went up the space needle which my daughter loved! There are lots of great shops around the hotel. I would stay here again - particularly once the pool reopens ;)!

State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location. This was one of its sole redeeming factors. While the room was spacious, and the furniture was beautiful and well-made, the linens were of the cheapest quality. The towels were thin and scratchy; there were no robes. Our pillowcases were stained, and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned. We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights. We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it. However, when we got there, we were constantly nickel-and-dimed. Over thirty dollars a day for parking. What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars? For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking. Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop, and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each. I understand that these are luxury services and that some fees usually apply, but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling. Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star. The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it. I recommend this hotel only if you don't mind blithely throwing money around, and if you bring your own towels. Next year, we are trying somewhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19617248">Clean and well located, albeit over priced.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19493012">We arrived in Seattle after a long flight from London and our first impression of the Sheraton was very good. The external facade was impressive, the reception bright , spacious and airy and we received a warm welcome. Unfortunately, once we got to our Club Level Room, things began to go downhill. The room, whilst spacious and clean, looked tired and outdated, the colour scheme being shades of beige. The bathroom was small and the bathtub was about a foot deep and practically useless. However the worst was yet to come. After having a meal in the Daily Grill, which was fairly good, we went to bed. That is when the doors started slamming............all night! The door mechanisms failed to work so when everybody entered or exited their rooms the door slammed. You could hear doors slamming 10 rooms away and it coninued into the early hours of the morning. Hence, we did not have a proper nights sleep for 3 nights. When I raised the issue with the front desk, they knew immediately what I was coplaining about, so why has this not been resolved? This just shows contempt for the customer. This is unacceptable for any standard of hotel, never mind a four star establishment. I received a fifty dollar per night credit but frankly would have preferred to sleep. In conclusion, I would not recommend this hotel until they take the comfort of their guests more seriously and sort out the doors. In truth, it was an average hotel with a significant problem.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19362713">I have travelled all over the world and tend to stay in hotels which are 4 or 5 stars. We booked through the Sheraton website and got the room practically for free! (only $156 per night). So I was going into this with the mindset that if things weren't all that great, it was okay, because of the cheap price. I am so happy to say that this hotel was WONDERFUL! The rooms were new, beautifully decorated, and clean. The Sheraton chain is known for their great beds and pillows, and this hotel was no exception, among the best I've slept in. The staff were extremely professional, polite, and friendly. The bellhops and the receptionists were first rate. The location is excellent as it is only a few blocks from Pike Market. There are several restaurant and shopping options all within walking distance. Also, lots of banks nearby (if you need to withrdraw cash, etc). We used room service twice. The food was excellent and recieved very fast. Of course, it was expensive, but hey, it's room service and you're staying in an upscale hotel. If you're looking for an economical or practically priced meal, you need to leave the hotel and eat elsewhere. We also had breakfast in their restaurant. Excellent food, exquisite service. Again, pricey, but hey, if you're on a budget, don't stay at the Sheraton. One more thing to note, their toiletries were wonderful! Mandarin orange and mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions. I didn't even take my own out to use, as theirs were so nice. The only negative thing I can comment on is that when we arrived mid day, we took a nap. During the day it was quite difficult as it was very noisy outside the room, in the hallways. However, at night we had no problems and slept very well. I wouldn't even think about finding another hotel if I'm ever in Seattle again. The Sheraton is just right for me.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17698599">I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights in July while in the Seattle area on business.

I happened to be on the 34th floor, just below the fitness center and pool on the 35th floor which were under renovation. There was quite a bit of drilling/jack hammering going on from about 9:00AM until about 4:00PM, which was annoying, but at least it wasn't going on at 6AM. A temporary fitness facility has been setup in the newer tower, and it does the job. The room was comfortable with a nice, large flat panel television and plenty of space to spread out. The hotel staff was friendly and the check-in process was quick and efficient. The location is also great with plenty of shopping and restaurants within a quick walk from the front doors.

Went to Seattle for our Aniversary. They put us in a small room, with a horrible view. The worst thing was the beds were so small, we had to sleep in seperate beds!!!! The Pool, Spa, And exercise facility's are all closed and will not reopen until October, I think is the month the lady at the front desk said. She was very rude, and said the Hotel had notified Priceline of the facility closures. Our room was not cleaned properly, towels looked like they were thrown on the hooks, dirty glasses not exchanged, beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor??? Better bring alot of extra cash. Stayed 2 days parking was 56 bucks. The water in the room is not drinkable, However you can buy there's $$$$. Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$.

Sometimes I had 3 sets of towels, sometimes 2 sets. I found it a little odd that in the capitol of coffee, there wasn't a coffee stand available in the hotel. The closest Starbucks was a half block away at the Hyatt. Why one couldn't be made available in the hotel was a little odd. One inconvenience was that the work out room was being renovated and not available during my stay. If you are attending a meeting at the convention center, the Sheraton is directly across the street, but many other hotels are extremely short walks and less expensive. I'd probably recommend another hotel as the amenities were really nothing to write home about and the hotel is more costly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17161653">Great Location to downtown Seattle. Just around the corner is the monorail to Space Needle and EMP. Loved EMP and so did my family. Walking distance to Pike Market. We were on the 32 floor nice views. Checked in late that evening, hotel staff was very rude especially a manager 1 night and a little prejudice.

Arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and asked for early check-in. The front desk staff was nice. Upon seeing my SPG Gold membership card, she checked me in, even though technically Hotwire bookings do not qualify for SPG Gold benefits. The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's just a few blocks walk to the Pike Place market, the water front. Monorail station is just 2 blocks away. Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby. I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a "Thank you" note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel. This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind, the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in. The first day, the maid took the tip and left me a "thank you" note. The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon. That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room. I called the hotel immediately. The guest service rep took my room number, dates of stay, name and phone number, and said that they would call me if "someone turns it in". There was no indication that they are trying to look for it. I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest. One week passed and no phone call. I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle. The guest service simply said that "we have your inquiry on file. If it turns up, we will call you." Again no indication of any willingness to help. I know that leaving something behind is my mistake, but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR15095084">Just returned from the Sheraton in Seattle. I am a travel agent (Journeys Around the World) so try out many hotels each year. I was in Seattle for a conference &amp; it is right next door to the Convention Center, which was very convenient. The hotel is very very nice...beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, nice lobby bar (and very popular) &amp; good restaurant (although pricey). Stayed in the "new" tower &amp; the rooms were very nice with new flat screen tv. And with it being Seattle, there was Starbucks coffee in the room (with real creamer, rather than the powdered stuff!).

The hotel was perfect for business or pleasure.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15094607">I want to assure you I did not priceline this hotel, i wanted to be sure I stayed at the Sheraton and so I didn't risk it and paid the full price. Not cheap, anyway my gripe is this, the view was blah, and the room was blah, and the shower was a joke. Not 4 star quality, the linens and the bed comfort wise was great. The lobby was that of a 4star hotel, as was the valet parking price, the restaurant's breakfast was not. My biggest gripe was not the mishmash furniture in the room or even the 15 year old tv. My biggest let down was the shower, the tap had to practically be on the furthest hot setting for it to be even bearably warm and the water did not drain properly so I had to sit in 6 inches of water (cold water) while taking a shower. I did not complain to management as I was only there one night and only used the shower the morning I was leaving so there was nothing to be done at that point.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR15055746">My husband and I went to Seattle to see a Dave Matthews show, and stayed in the Sheraton (Main Tower/ King) for one night.

Get a round trip ticket on The Gray Line bus from the airport and you'll be able to walk or use public transportation for the rest of your trip. We were able to check in early, 11:00 am.

My only regret is that we only stayed one night!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14742815">My husband was attending a conference at the hotel and we chose to stay directly at the hotel for the latter part of the conference. The first few days we spent at the Alexis which was absolutely gorgeous. Even though we booked directly through the Sheraton's website, they were unable to accommodate us with a room in the newly refurbished section of the hotel unless we chose a room with only double beds. Although the room was good sized, it was very drab. The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered, and the toiletries provided were way too perfumey. What can I say, a simple pleasure of mine is to enjoy the lotions, etc. that the hotel provides. On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable and the heater noise was minimal. The front desk staff was also very nice. They nickel and dime you though. $12/day including tax for internet? Give me a break. I was spoiled by the room and amenities at the Alexis, and that's the only place I'll stay next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14710282">I have stayed at the Sheraton before the renovation and it was OK, dated, but not horrible. However, now the hotel is just great. Lobby looks amazing, fresh and luxurious. The rooms are great, updated in all possible ways. I cannot tell if the walls are very well insulated, or if the hotel was half-empty, but it was very quiet in the room. Location of the hotel is obviously excellent, right in the middle of downtown. On the negatives, the ice machine in our floor had not been turned on. Parking is very expensive and valet is slow at peak times. Hotel needs a bar with extended hours, we wanted one more rounds of drinks just after midnight on a Saturday night and nothing in the hotel was open. The staff could not tell where a closest bar would be.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14284087">The valets just stand around and stare at you instead of getting your keys or asking if you need help.

When I got there it was about noon and I had to wait until after 2:30 to check in but they held our bags for us &amp; we just went out and grabbed some lunch. There was a little bit if a mix- up regarding my request for a king size bed but the management ended up upgrading me to a corner room (larger room, HDTV, king bed) and didn't charge us. We also asked to be put in the new tower, as recommended by other people here. It was nice but we explored the older tower and it was nice too. My only complaint about the new tower is that the pool/spa/ workout area is located on top of the OLD tower and you have to go through the lobby to get to it. If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower. Free wifi in the lobby but you have to pay for it in the room. A GREAT room safe! I have a larger laptop and this is the first hotel that it could be locked up with room to spare. The staff was professional and polite, and they actually knew the answers to any questions I asked. The place was spotless, even with a convention going on. We asked for robes and they happily supplied 2 nice comfy ones...no charge. My only minuses were the bed was a little hard (but still comfy) and the additional fees for the little things...which is typical of the hotels in Seattle anyway. Parking was $35 a day and in-room internet was $11 a day. Otherwise: nice size rooms, good security, friendly staff, clean, and the employees were professional and friendly. If you are flying in I would suggest not renting a car as down Seattle can get crazy &amp; parking is expensive. This hotel was within walking distance to most attractions (the Space Needle has a monorail a couple of blocks away) and I would be happy to stay there again. A cab from/to the airport is about $30. They have a generic shuttle that runs through a string of different hotels for $18 round trip pp.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11098518">My family and I stayed at the Seatown Sheraton for some Black Friday shopping. We had 3 rooms on the 20th floor; the rooms we had were not the newly reno'd ones, but we did not mind. The carpets in the rooms and halls showed some wear, but overall the rooms, bathrooms and hallways were bright and clean and appointed nicely. As is usually the case for Sheratons, their beds are the best in the business, hands down. Our floor was very quite, as well. The lobby and common areas like the pool and fitness center were typical of this level of hotel. We did not eat at any of the restaurants. The best part of the hotel is definately the location. It is right beside some good shops and restaurants and is just a short (pleasant) stroll to Fishermans and Pioneer. We were pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the valet's. We had read a lot of complaints about the valet service, but we got very good, prompt service whenever we needed our cars pulled. This was considering that everyone seems to check in and out at exactly the same time!!! As is mentioned in other posts, if you don't want your car valet'd you can park across the street at the convention centre for a cheaper price.......... We used Starwood Hotel points for our rooms so I don't know what the typical rate for the rooms would be, but I would definately pay ~ $100-120 per night for these rooms; probably more if I was assured one of the new reno'd rooms.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11033824">Stayed here for some holiday shopping.

When we went to get our car the next day at check out it was over a half hour wait. We need to have a member of our party to the eastside in half an hour.

The hotel is literally a hop away from the Washington State Convention Center which was extremely convenient. Within 5 blks from the famous Farmers market and ocean ports. Plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. You are definately a cab ride away from the Space needle, SafeCo field and Qwest Stadiums. One thing about Seattle were the ever so present groups of mischevious teenagers hanging out on the streets and the lot of beggars constantly looking for spare change while you tried to navigate the streets and shop. Seattle is a very cute downtown with plenty to see. It smelled very clean and it was great to see the buses didn't emit nasty gases like they do where I'm from in Chicago. As for the hotel, the staff were very friendly and prompt for everything and anything you needed. They seemed to remember you. The lobby was impressive and very modern with nice floral touches. The elevators were always very fast. The room I stayed in was on the 16th floor (right off the bank of elevators), didn't hear a sound any of the 3 nights I stayed here. The room is very plain, didn't feel like a Sheraton, it was a plain room. However it was extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable and had 4 pillows on it! No wifi service in the room you need to go the lobby for free wifi, or pay for it in your room, which is annoying. The room service was very tasty and arrived within 30 minutes as promised. Maid service seemed to come late every day, about 4pm which was a little annoying.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10481482">I don't usually like to stay at the big hotel chains, but I tried Priceline for the first time and got this hotel for $100/night. Front desk gave us one of the new Tower Rooms without asking and they were really quite nice. WiFi is not free - I think it is about $10 a day, but they have a few computers on the main floor by the elevator along with a printer. It was actually very convenient. Location is great - close enough to the I-5, really easy access to any of the trendy Seattle neighbourhoods. Shopping, Pike Place, etc. is also walkable. If you are there over the weekend instead of the Valet parking, simply park it yourself across the street in the parkade - it is less than $10 a day, versus the $30 the Hotel apparently charges. And they park it there anyway. Note - we did leave it overnight for a day during the week and the garage charged $30. Good option - really nice staff - super clean. Would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10295428">I rate the Seattle Sheraton somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars based on 3 critiques. But first, the pros: *I made this booking on Hotwire, and got a fabulous rate (~$120 for a Fri. and Sat. in late Oct. This is a smashing deal considering you're right smack dab in the heart of Seattle. If you're a tourist and hate to drive, you can be dropped off by taxi and not need a car for the rest of your trip (you can walk to everything in the downtown core, and at any given moment, there are several thousand taxis swarming around the place). *The staff were perfectly adequate, and actually quite pleasant. *We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the Daily Grill. As at most hotel restaurants, they'll stick it to you with inflated prices. However, the continental breakfast buffet @ $11.95 was a good deal. It might sound gross, but if you fill up on oatmeal and smoked salmon, you can probably skip lunch and splurge on dinner! Now, those 3 criticisms, one of them admittedly incredibly petty: *My mom and I had to schlepp our own bags up to our (smoking) room. This is one of Seattle's largest hotels, especially after they renovated and built a 2nd tower. You're telling me that they don't have enough bell staff, especially the Friday night before a UW home game? Even if you're short-staffed, you tell the guests to check in and that their luggage will catch up to them eventually. You don't blithely look in the other direction and let the guests awkwardly corral their own bags. Boo. Minus stars. *The first room we were assigned reeked of smoke. I know, I know--the whole property is non-smoking; they can't help it if a few jerks--err, I mean, die-hard smokers--flaunt the rules and stink up the place. Anyway, we asked for a new room and were moved promptly. *My last complaint is really, really petty. I know Sheraton is a Starwood chain, and I fondly remember staying at a W a few years ago and ransacking their Aveda toiletries. (I mean, I practically absconded with my weight in tiny Aveda bottles.) So, imagine my puzzlement to discover Vaseline-brand body lotion in the bathroom! (The Rusk shampoo and conditioner was nice, but still--I love Aveda.) So, to summarize, if you can get a screaming good deal on Hotwire or wherever, by all means book/stay at the Seattle Sheraton. I highly recommend it--if you can't get a better rate at the Westin or Hyatt. Otherwise, it's a perfectly adequate venue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10287412">The location of the Sheraton Seattle is exemplary. Seattle Center (Space Needle), Pikes Place Market, the Waterfront, Capitol Hill and Museums are all within easy walking distance, and a bus to Bellevue is easy to come by. We even took a cab to a restaurant in Ballard and it wasn't very expensive. The rooms are nice, clean, average size. I was a bit disappointed in the tub, which was tiny (I'm 6'2" and like to have a relaxing bath when I travel), but definitely serviceable. The main down-side of the hotel is that everything costs extra, from wi-fi (how can hotels still charge for this?) to toll-free calls (I called my 1-800 number to call my home voice-mail and it ended up costing me $2.00), and the parking, which is exorbitant ($35 for valet, $28 for self-park). My advice would be to not even bring a car into downtown Seattle. Street parking is pretty difficult at all times. The concierge was very knowledgeable and friendly. The fitness center, pool and jacuzzi on the 35th floor of the old tower was nice, although the pool seem over-chlorinated. The view from up there is great. Walking around downtown I saw a few B&amp;Bs that might have been a more distinctive stay, but the Sheraton did us well. We paid $142/night via Priceline.com.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10098175">Park across the street, $6 for 24hrs on weekends, $35+ at the hotel. Check-in was efficient, mechanically so, but painless. Stayed in the old tower 10th floor. Nize size rooms with adequate bath. Quiet, comfy bed. However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit. The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross). Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all.

I stayed on the 27th floor of the "old" tower. I was tempted at check-in to ask for the "new" tower as TripAdvisor posts recommended. At the last moment though, I thought I would rough it. Truth be told - the "old" - I hate that descriptive - the "classic" tower was very nice. I got a great view of downtown in a room that was very comfortable and quiet. I liked how large the space was. Big bathroom, big bedroom, big dresser, ample closet space, etc. The room temperature stayed nice and I never touched the thermostat. The staff at the Sheraton were great too. At check-in, a tall, beautiful woman, zoomed me through the process - did not change her high level of service when she realized I was a hotwire customer and offered me upgrades without prompting. I was in the door of the hotel and into my room in 5-7 minutes. On my last day at the hotel - I hit the restaurant for a breakfast buffet. The sausage and potatoes with eggs were fantastic. They had an ample supply of fresh fruit and healthy alternatives - that I appreciated but avoided. I was overly hungry from eating sushi the night before - and feeling less than full. I highly recommend the Sheraton Seattle. What a great visit. When and if I go back - it'll be the Sheraton for sure. Other cool thing - the Grayline Boeing tour loads at none other than the Sheraton.

The second night we called security,which led to toning down of the noise for 20 minutes, but had to call again before people who were obviously totally drunk(or worse) left. The hotel stole our thunder the next morning by calling us to say that $50.00 would be taken off our bill--not really enough to compensate for two nights of disturbed sleep . We wondered whether security was really on top of things. Breakfast was a problem as there seemed to be many tours using the one facility, which had a long waiting time.

Despite the constant throng of arrivals and departures the team out front do a great job marshalling the press of traffic, parking and retrieving cars, getting cabs and keeping everything moving smoothly. The location for enjoying Seattleâ€™s shopping and dining is unsurpassed. Check in was friendly and efficient and the only mention of Priceline was, â€œYour room has been pre-paid by Priceline.â€� We really liked our room, it was a decent size for a city centre, the dÃ©cor was minimalist cool without sacrificing functionality and everywhere was clean. The bathroom was a good size, well fitted, supplied with nice toiletries and again clean. The Bad We were lucky, arriving in a comparative lull, and only waited while one person was checked in in front of us. Throughout our four night stay, every evening as we went out to dinner there was a snake of people wound to and fro round the lobby, wearily waiting in line to check in. Some of them looked as if they had been there for hours! Possibly connected to the above the extensive seating area of to one side of the lobby was always packed with people trying to sleep on the couches and armchairs with luggage strewn around them; it was reminiscent of a refugee clearing centre. You pay for the great team working out front. Valet parking is now an eye watering $35 per day. The Ugly We went into the bar one evening for a pre-dinner cocktail.

The location is EXCELLENT! I usually stay at the Vintage Park when visiting, but for some reason, the rates were pretty high and I found a very good rate of $169/night through their website for a room in the Union Tower. For that price, I was pretty satisfied. I usually dread sleeping away from home as I own a Presidential Plaza bed, but I gotta say the beds at this hotel were pretty damn comfortable and cozy! Only complaint I had was the room service food - OVERPRICED and GROSS! Also, the valet parking was $35/night, but I knew that before booking, so I decided to fly down instead and drive back up with some friends. The service is satisfactory, but not at all bad.

I didn't really expect to receive what I'd asked for, afterall I only payed $125 with Priceline. However, upon checkin I was pleasantly suprised to have been assigned a King room in the new tower. The room was lovely. Very comfy bed, lovely view, and a nicer TV than I have at home :), . Bathroom was bright, clean, and comfortable. Location was very convenient. Concierge was most helpful in helping us find out which city bus to take to get to King Street Station. Will not hesitate to stay here again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8604158">This was our third time staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Seattle and it was our third time being disappointed. Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006) and our last trip was during the last week of August 2007. The first year that we booked this hotel we called them directly (after booking our room with an on-line service) to comfirm that they were the same hotel that hosts the famous Ginger Bread House competition for the local chefs. Once we arrived to the hotel, we were very surprised to find that the hotel was not only in shambles from being under construction, but that they had moved the Ginger Bread houses to another location entirely (an imprortant fact that they forgot to mention when we were calling to confirm that the Ginger Bread houses were indeed going to be there). On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com. We were a little disappointed when we found out that the hotel that accepted our bid was the Sheraton. We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance. We thought that there was no way that the hotel could still be under construction, but once again we were greeted with the confusion and mess of construction. The place was a mess and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found. This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time. And once again we ended up with the Sheraton. I again decided that I would be optimistic and hope for the best. I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby and new tower were no longer a construction zone, but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on and the room we were given. The table outside of the elevator had garbage on it and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay. The room that they gave us looked out into the alley and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there. Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel. I think that their star rating should be brought down a notch or two. Needless to say, I don't think that we will be staying at the Sharaton any time soon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8591979">Stayed here for 2 nights. It was expensive (parking is $35/night) but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps. You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center. We stayed in the tower facing Union St which has been remodeled. We had a plasma in our king room and the furniture is contemporary. Really liked the room and had no problems with noise. If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay. Just make sure you stay in the remodeled section. And the concierge was extremely helpful. I believe the lobby has free wireless, but it may cost to connect in the room. The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost. I know it's a major city and it's downtown but I still think it's too high.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8516070">It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel. They were no help to us at all. The concierge had no idea about the sites in the city, how to get there and espically how to get back. After finding a concierge who knew where Fishermans Terminal was she advised taking a cab, which we did. Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area. We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do. Saw other guests who were also upset.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8510309">Stayed 3 nights at the hotel with my extended family. The location was great - we were able to easily walk to Pike's Market, the monorail to Seattle Center, and even to Safeco Field. We were in the new tower, and the room was immaculate, including an LCD, attached to the wall, TV (we didn't watch it much, but it had a really impressive picture). Health club was OK, as was the indoor pool, whose best recommendation was that it was on the 35th floor. The construction mentioned in earlier reviews is basically done, other than some areas near the restaurant (which we never used). There was a small problem in our room (one of the 2 beds was not stable), but the hotel fixed it promptly and took $20 off our bill for the trouble. I would definitely recommend the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8421414">I just got back from Seattle and I thought the Sheraton was just average. The room needed a make over. The carpet was stained in certain spots, the shower head needed to be replaced(you could hurt yourself with that thing) and the A/C didn't work very well. It turns out we were in one of the older rooms. The other tower had the newer updated rooms. The staff however was extremely helpful and nice. The location was awesome(just a few blocks from Pike's Market) and the rooms were very quiet. We really enjoyed the bar in the restaurant on the lower level and the drink prices were reasonable. I would stay here again but I would request a room in the new tower.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8399687">Stay here only if you like lots of noise, crowds, have fairly low standards, and get a deal. My experience here was much different than at other Starwood hotels. This is a huge convention hotel and hotel for people leaving on cruises. I suspect they pay very little for their rooms. Buses of people constantly arrived while we were there for a 3 night stay. Parking was $35 a night. If I did it again, I would look for a small boutique hotel. I booked 2 rooms via Starwood's website several weeks in advance of my stay. I am Starwood Gold. I called the hotel in advance and asked for 2 rooms connecting or adjacent on the club level, in a quiet area. I did not get a "deal." When checking in, there were probably 100 people in line--no joke. Fortunately there was a separate line for Gold and Platinum members. We were told we could not have adjacent rooms--they were on separate floors. We were not offered an upgrade. The rooms were not ready at 2:45 p.m. (Gold gets early check-in). Fortunately a big tip to a porter got us adjacent rooms on the club level, but in a VERY noisy area--right next to the club lounge and elevators that ding nonstop and feature a recorded lady's voice "You are on the 32nd floor." Parking was $35 a night. The workout room is dreary and in bad need of updating. The pool area looks a bit dated and sad. It's a big pool with enough chlorine to make you itch for weeks. You can't call for your car in advance--you wait at the valet for a long time before they will pull it around. I will pass next time!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8395400">This hotel was about a five minute walk from Pike's Market. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The fitness center is adequate and gives a great view while on the treadmill. Parking was pretty steep at 35 bucks a night. We spent two nights and with parking it cost us a little over 400 dollars. The business center offers free computer services and printing. This was helpful in getting directions from MapQuest.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8375714">We had a late arrival on July 19, 2007. We booked two rooms, the hotel once we arrived was sold out so our rooms were not adjacent nor in the new tower as requested through Sheraton. We arrived by limo from the airport as we had 3 adults and 2 children travelling. (limo was $45 -great deal at the airport and you don't have to wait in the taxi line!) Although they could not put me in the new tower like I had requested our room was great and overlooked the street right in front of the hotel. The pool on the top floor was great and had an amazing panaramic view of the entire city. The service was wonderful and we had an early check out at 6am on the 21st and the staff was very pleasant and were right there to help with all of our bags. I would without a doubt stay here again. All of the construction has been completed and the lobby is large and beautiful. The bar/restaurant has a great happy hour as well. The Sheraton Seattle made our short stay in Seattle perfect with its quick walk to Pike's Market where once there you can also catch a bus down to tour the Mariner's stadium - It's a great city!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8241371">The Hotel is in a great location. Staying on the club floor we got an awesome continental breakfast. The fruit selection was outstanding. I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice. It is in need of a serious upgrade. Treadmills were in very bad need of repair. (all of them)...The room was very small. If 8-10 people were in there, forget about working out. The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all. The pool was average at best. Rooms were nothing special. The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me. There is no way I would pay anything over 200 a night to stay here. There are many other quality hotels in all aspects for near that price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8215336">We booked this hotel on hotwire and the rate was still high...$200 per night. When we arrived at the hotel, my husband and I requested a king bed. We were asked to pay an additional $20 per night to have a king bed in the new tower. In addition, parking is $35 per night. So, just expect that you will pay a bit more than anticipated if you have special requests. On the good side, we ordered room service the first night which was delicious and delivered in 10 minutes! Room service is expensive, but that is always the case in hotels. Our room in the new tower was lovely and spacious with a great view of the city. We enjoyed the complimentary starbucks coffee. However, they put out "snacks" to tempt you to spend more. After the first night, I woke up early due to time zone changes. I decided to go to the gym. It does not open until 5:30 AM and there is no place to have coffee until then. The elevator won't allow you to access the 35th floor (location of pool/gym) until 5:30, so the front desk staff suggested I take the stairs. Well, the door on the 35th floor was locked so I almost got locked in the stairwell. The exercise room is good, but small. The pool was fine, but full of children. The jacuzzi was warm but the jets were broken. We loved the location of the hotel and enjoyed the convenient shoppoing and dining. Try the Tap...restaurant across the street. The food was reasonably priced, delcious, and they offered 160 types of beer on tap (not my thing, but interesting). We would stay at the Sheraton again, but would have open eyes about the expenses.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8181414">We got a rate of $99 on Priceline. They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways! On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the "room", strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room. The front desk is disorganized, the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.Theres a nice view from the pool/health club. The location is good for touring. Theres no place for breakfast. I would never consider staying here for rack rate but for a priceline stay, it's fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8123630">Requested new tower and upgrade (being Starwood Preferred member) - got neither - maybe call the day before? Anyway room was fine EXCEPT - ice maker on my floor didn't work my entire visit (I complained twice) - coffee pot in my room didn't work - they took it away but didn't bring a new one or hand towels until I reminded them a second time. also the malfunctioning coffee pot spilt over onto below the sink and they did not clean that. YOu have to go to the lobby for free internet. Business center was full at midnight when I went to print my boarding pass - I had to BEG at the desk to have them print it. Lots of construction still going on. But I do still love Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8015543">Booked a club level room for three nights for the price of two through a deal on the Starwoods website. I checked in on the weekend so obviously the lobby was very busy but service was fast &amp; efficient, checking out during the week had no waits. The lobby has free wireless internet available &amp; comfortable sofas/chairs. Had a room on the 33rd floor which included complimentary high speed internet; club lounge has complimentary continental breakfast of lots of varied fresh fruit, cereals, coffee &amp; pastries; hors d'oeuvres of veggies, cheeses, small desserts &amp; drinks in the evening. The only disappointing things were that there was bird defecation on the window &amp; the ice bucket still had a bag of water in it. I didn't use/touch it &amp; neither did housekeeping for 2 days. The bed of course was the best part with a great mattress &amp; sound sleep. Otherwise it was fairly standard: hairdryer, coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee &amp; tea, iron &amp; ironing board, large safe that you could fit a laptop inside of, good shower. Health club/pool/hot tub: I never went in the pool or hot tub because it was always busy morning/evening &amp; as well, lots of children/families. I did use the health club every day which consists of 4 treadmills with views of Seattle, one crosstrainer, a few bikes. My only complaint was that the room was too warm with the sun shining in &amp; just being in a small area with a lot of people working out. You can't beat the location: a block or two away from the main shopping street (Nordstroms, Barnes &amp; Noble, Sephora, etc), coffee places, restaurants. Also a 5 block or so quick, easy walk to Pike Market &amp; the new Seattle Art Museum on First Ave.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8002355">The renovations are now complete, or at least we didn't see or hear any construction. We stayed at this same hotel a few years ago. The hotel is nice, and even nicer now. However, the service is still poor. We paid a lot for our room ($200/per night). We choose the hotel because of the location. It took over 45 minutes to get our bags from the door to our room(and then we called to find out where they were). The room still had trash from the previous guest. Parking is $35/per day. We felt for the price we paid, the service could be better and the staff more friendly. A little extra could go a long way.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7869420">The hotel was nice even though it was still under renovations. One thing I noticed right away was that the staff didn't seem happy to be there, but it was friday night and I am sure they all didnt want to be there. I walked into my room not knowing what to expect and I was pleasantly suprised. The room was very spacias and the views were nice. The bed was comfortable. I was in RM 1901 - Traditional King. I didnt feel that this hotel was a 4 star, but it was stilla very good 3 - 3.5 star hotel but they charge a 4 star price. I would have not stayed here if I didnt get a steal of a deal on Hotwire. It was close to a lot of shopping and all the stores downtown and only a few blocks from Pike's Public Market. The only incident I had was at 11:15 friday night. I hadnt had anything to eat all night long so I called down to room service and was on hold for 15 minutes listening to music and the same hotel recording. I called down to the front desk and explained the issue and they just connected me to the same line - so after being on hold for another 10 minutes - I just went outside and found some dinner.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7854261">My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago. The lobby was not open (still under renovation, I guess) when we arrived, so the reception and concierge desks were shoved into a crowded hallway. Check in went smoothly, and we were given a room promptly even though we arrived a few hours before the official check-in time. When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom and the toilet was FILTHY! I will spare you the details, but clearly it had not been cleaned after the last guest. Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom, but that negative first impression still lingers. The rest of the room was OK - typical decor, above average bed, decent view of the city from our 20th floor room. The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location. It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference. It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops. There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either. No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though. I tried to get "take out" coffee from the restaurant, but the request seemed to confuse everyone. It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup. I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE! Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel. Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK. Its location made up for its weaknesses, but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center. If I were going back to Seattle just for vacation, I would probably try a different hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7854137">As many others have reported, we stayed at the Sheraton one night prior to taking a cruise. We had only positive experiences there. Check in was speedy, the bed was comfy, lunch the next day was good, and the employees were pleasant and helpful. We walked to Pikes Market with no problem, and if we ever return to Seattle we would most likely stay at the Sheraton again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7742356">My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so, our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers. Regardless, there are a few good things to mention. We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt. The beds were very comfortable and if you stay on the 30th floor or above, the views are spectacular. We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night. However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club. Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant. It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with and timeliness of service was an issue as well. Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget. This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves. So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7732693">The Sheraton is going through some construction phase but as an update to the previous reviews, the entrance into the lobby is now open as well as the driveway to the entrance. However, the lobby is still block off on the left hand-side which make the lobby a bit restrictive in size. I don't linger in the lobby so that is not a problem for me. The check-in was quick and friendly. By my SPG status I was upgraded to a corner room on the executive level on the 33rd floor. The room is above average size with the usual Sheraton yellow and buff stripes wallpaper. The room has been kept pretty clean although there are sign of date on parts of the room. There are obvious upgrades that has been done to the room to buff up its 80's image but there are still a few pieces of the furnitures that shows its age. The Sweet Sleeper bed is comfortable and on the soft side. The bed covers and accessories are a level above the usual standard Sheratons'. The mini-safe in the closet is the largest in-room safe that I have seen. It is almost as big as the mini-bar and can fit my laptop and still have plenty of space left for my SLR camera and lenses. The bathroom is actually larger than the usual Sheraton but due to the layout, it feels as if it is the same size. The Pantene bath products are omnipresent here as they are in other Sheraton. Nothing exceptional here. The location of the Sheraton is excellent, close to the Convention Center and major malls or tourist sites are just a few blocks from either way. This is one of the nicer Sheraton that I have stayed in and at the top of my list of Sheraton hotels in North America.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7683996">I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle one day before a cruise. The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many downtown restaurants and shops. The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel. The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street. There was no one there to help me with my luggage and no ramp up from the street. Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage. Too late! Check in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes. There are two sets of elevators depending on which floor you are on and I was directed to the wrong set. Fortunately I caught the error before getting on. The room was clean and standard but outdated in shades of buff and yellow. There is no gift/sundry shop due to the construction and the restaurant/bar is just a cordoned off section of the lobby. I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction and refurbishment is finished but not before then. Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7667939">My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for two nights prior to our Alaskan cruise out of Seattle. I booked this hotel on Hotwire for 129 per night, which I think is a good deal for the $$. Pro: Great location, just a few easy blocks straight down the street to Pikes Market, the monorail to the Space Needle, etc. Big bed, comfortable, good coffee. Quiet overall. Con: Small disorganized lobby (under renovation), slow elevators, dated room furniture and decor. Overall, a very nice place, and I have no major complaints. However, I wouldn't rate it a four star, nor would I be willing to pay much more for the room than what I paid.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7642084">My daughter and I (the mom) stayed at the Sheraton Seattle for two nights, Fri./Sat. in May. I was able to book a "week-end" special, so it ended up being cheaper than staying at the Best Western near the Space Needle. We couldn't have asked for a nicer room. It was actually a "handicap" room, and it was spacious. We had two over-sized double beds, which were more like queens, a huge bathroom, and a large picture window overlooking downtown. The room was located in a little alcove, so there was no noise from people walking by in the hallway. The Sheraton is located in the heart of the city, within walking distance of everything. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely stay at the Sheraton Seattle again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7628339">I write this review as a leisure traveller. This hotel has a superb location and the beds are super comfortable but that's about it. The valet parking is $35.00 enough said. The rooms are not modern in any way starting with a 10 year old television. What strikes me is the odd lay-out of the bathroom. Open the door and you walk straight into a wall( you better be sober!), step out of the shower and your foot will be in the toilet. This is not a quiet hotel. The noise from showers around you will not allow you to fall back to sleep if you are awaken. The noise from doors closing can be compared to how a door would close after a 6 hour arguement with your girlfriend or boyfriend, the foundations literallly shake. I don't know why someone would want to stay at this hotel for the prices charged, if you're going to spend the money stay at the Hyatt or Westin . If you're on a budget stay in Bellevue, the hotels are every bit as nice or better. I would recommend the Bellevue Athletic Club, the Hyatt or the Westin. Take a taxi or public transport into town and you'll save enough money for a steak dinner at Ruth Chris.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7591561">I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two small children, from May 2nd through May 5th. We were there so my husband could attend a meeting at the Convention Center. I really have no complaints. Our room was big and clean. We were on the 19th floor and had no problems with noise. They are still renovating so the lobby is small. However, it is clean and still very nice looking. Based on previous reviews I had some concern about staying at this hotel. I had no reason to worry. If you can enjoy a hotel without a large lobby, then don't worry about the renovations. What I want to convey to others considering this hotel is don't worry about choosing this hotel. It is nice and clean and is in a great location with tons of places to eat all around. I don't understand why a previous reviewer said there were few options. The shopping in the area is amazing. I lived in San Francisco for ten years so I know what a great downtown area is like and this is a great location. Easy walk to Pikes Market. My only suggestion to those traveling with small children, if you want a small fridge, the hotel charges $30 a day. I rented a fridge and microwave and bedrails from a local baby equipment rental company. The company delivers the equipment to the hotel and picks it up when you are finished. I believe they charged $30 per week for the fridge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7555690">My wife and I got married here back on Labor day September 4, 2006. I will just start by a couple quick comments on the wedding then get back to the rooms and facilities. Our wedding was perfect and we couldn't have asked for anything better. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the ballrooms were gorgeous. Back to the review, The construction at that point didn't effect us for the most part. The front of the hotel was being worked on but the main entrance was still open. I was in a standard room the first night. Nothing special really except for the great Sheraton beds which are to die for. The pool was average as well and the gym was nothing to write home about. I would expect a little more from the Sheraton chain in regards to these areas. The hallways and lobby are very nice and extremely clean. The suite we stayed in on our wedding night was very outdated. Run down furniture, old time TV (with a VCR no less). It was very clean and we had the staff's full attention but they should really modernize some of the rooms, especially the suites.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7461847">I stayed at the Sheraton while attending a conference across the street in the Seattle Convention Center (20-23 April). This was the conference hotel, so their rate was reasonable $209. As a Starwoods Preferred Member - Gold, I stayed on the Club floor - which allowed me access to their club room - serving continental breakfast and light food during the evening. Also, room had a nice view, television, internet and printer access and was open 24 hours. Free local and 800 phone use from the room. Hotel under major renovations currently, so the front door/lobby was missing. Adding a second tower to their facilities and moving the front door to match a driveway for drop-off. Be that as it may, they had temporary counter for check-in, concierge, bellman, etc. Check-in was slow though, as there was at first only one person at the counter, regardless of preferred member status or not. Hallways were all narrow given the temporary walls up for construction, so a queue of people waiting for check-in blocked easy access to the door and hallway leading to the concierge/etc. After check-in I had a room on the 34th floor w/ the 35th floor housing the pool, gym and meeting rooms. At night I would hear the staff moving furniture across the floor on rollers. Room was typical size, usual amenities. A larger size safe was available, which fit my laptop and other gadgets well. Bathroom was typical - no special amenities. Coffee machine serving Starbucks, mini-bar and assorted munchies available. Be careful - water bottles at $5.00/bottle. I was initially overcharged $28 for mini-bar use, when in fact, the key from the last guest was still in the fridge. Bed and bedding was nice. Two robes, towels fine, shower typical. Small desk with free internet connection available, though I was unable to connect to wi-fi, and had to use the wired connection taking me to the Sheraton website for log-in. Newspaper - Seattle Times and USA Today left at the door. Room service menu was not very appetizing, given the availability of local seafood. Not many restaurants nearby - Cheesecake Factory across the street. Other restaurants - Ruth Chris steakhouse, sushi/pan asian nearby in the Fairmont Hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant as it had the same menu as room service. Best part about the Sheraton was that it was directly across one street into the convention center - no other hotel that close. Also, plenty of security at the doors to limit traffic, as I noticed plenty of young kids and homeless panhandling in the area. Very typical convention hotel. I imagine once they open the 2nd tower the Sheraton will have a typical lobby, front entrance, drop-off area and other restaurants. No store available to offer toiletries, drinks, newspapers, etc, though I noticed behind the temporary counter they had a box of asundries available - toothpaste, brush, mouthwash, etc. Other reviews seem to indicate the need for fresh paint and new carpeting - I didn't see that in my room. Would stay here again, but may try something like the Westin or something near the waterfront area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7379873">I stayed here for a conference in March 2007, and even with the "special" conference rate, my 2-night stay was nearly $500.

Had a conference at the Convention center right around the back of the hotel, so it was super convenient. Had a view of the city and could see the Sound from my window. Great location and close to everything. We rented a car so we could get around if we needed to, but didn't use it too much. Husband came along with, and we had a great time. Walked down to the piers. Had a GREAT wine tasting dinner at Elliott's (highly recommended) and the obligatory bowl of clam chowder at Ivar's. My husband would bathe in that stuff if we could afford to get it shipped here in 100 gallon vats. (Gross, I know, but true.) Loved the Pike Place Market -- paid out the wazoo to ship home fresh salmon and halibut, but dang, was it good in my belly. Had a coffee at the original Starbucks, went to the Space Needle b/c you have to do it once (even though it's a rip off). Our favorite thing was taking our car on the ferry over to Bainbridge (sp?) Island and Fort Ward Park. Peaceful and we took lots of great pictures on our walk. I love ferry boats...(for all you GA fans out there, I wish SGH was a real place b/c I'd have thrown myself in front of a car just to need surgery in that place...kidding, obviously.) So....yes, I love Seattle, and the Sheraton is a nice hotel with a great location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7343281">The Sheraton Seattle is a great place to stay in Downtown Seattle on a budget. I received this hotel through a priceline bid that was half what the hotel cost through other sites. Had I paid full retail, I would have been disappointed, but it's a fine choice. Here are the Pros/Cons: Pros: 1. The location can't be beat. Awesome shopping - Nordstrom, Macy's and other great venues are within sight of the hotel. Nike Town and a great Adidas store are across the street. Great restaurants are nearby as well with a Cheesecake Factory across the street. Gameworks and a movie theater are across the street. It is right off of Pike Street and the Pike Street Market is within a few blocks of the hotel. 2. The staff is very nice and very accomodating. 3. I got a great rate through priceline. 4. The view. I could see the water and the mountains from my room - amazing. 5. People make a big deal of the remodel in their reviews. This is not an issue at all, but maybe that is because it's further along than when the early reviews were written. I didn't really notice anything. Cons: 1. They nickel and dime you horribly here. They charge something like $5-$7 a box if you have them delivered to your hotel from your office from FedEx/UPS. Maybe this is common, but I've never seen this and it's kind of ridiculous. 2. Parking is $36 a night! I've stayed in Chicago, San Fran and NYC and have not seen this - this is Seattle, not a top 5 sized market! 3. The room/furnishings are average at best. Hopefully the remodel helps this. The rooms isn't dirty or gross - just in need of some updating and the bed pales in comparison to a lot of hotel beds I've seen. Again, not bad, but not worthy of a "4-Star" hotel. If you get this through priceline, be happy - it's a great deal. If you paid retail, hopefully it works out for you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7265154">We just returned from a three night stay at the Seattle Sheaton and we couldn't have been happier. Thanks to previous postings, I booked our room through Priceline at an incredible $95/night. The parking was expensive at $28/night, but we felt that the cheap room made up for it. I did not have to wait in line at check-in and they gave us a room on the 30th floor with spectacular views of the city. The room was spotless and quiet. My kids loved the pool and it was very clean and never crowded. As a tourist, the location can't be beat. The main doors are on Pike Street and you are only a five block walk to the Pike Street Market. The monorail is two blocks away, and the shopping district is all around you. The construction is still going on in the lobby, but I never heard it or was inpacted by it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7239739">I stayed at the Sheraton recently while attending a conference. The proximity to the Convention Center and to Pike Place Market was a plus. The hotel is currently undergoing some renovations so the lobby is small and there was construction noise downstairs - but I couldn't hear the noise from the room. The room itself was fine but smallish. For the price, I have stayed in bigger places but I guess Seattle is expensive. The staff was pleasant but not over friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7191603">The hotel is under construction and the lobby is almost gone! The front desk can only accommodate 2-3 staff members so be prepared for a LONG wait checking in/out or to simply ask a question. While my spouse checked in, I went to ask the concierge for directions to a nearby restaurant that we had selected for dinner. There was no concierge at 8 P.M. on a Wednesday night. I then turned to the bellman who was very rude. Smokers line the walkway into the hotel so there is a smoke fog all the time. The room was ho-hum sand-colored Sheraton with no extras or frills. It had the minimum of niceties with a small predictable bathroom. We attended a reception in the Presidental Suite and the upholstery was so worn it was in shreds!!! Our room was not clean and the linens were not changed after it was requested daily. There were coffee grounds on the bathroom floor that were never cleaned the entire stay. There was an unidentified "something" on the edge of the toliet. I hate to think... We travel a lot and I would not stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6901969">My husband consistently waits until one month prior to book a hotel for his conferences. Hence we always get stuck with the 'fourth' choice at the 'conference rate'. There is a reason this Sheraton is 'fourth choice'. It lacks any kind of panache, pizazz or pleasantry. This is your straight up vanilla cookie cutter conference hotel. Rooms are boring, carpets are stained, tubs are old, phones still connected to cords in your room, tv doesn't swivel, amenities are lackluster at best (no Bliss or Aveda treats here), dings on all the furnishings, scuff marks on the walls and closet doors, ancient, and I do mean ancient thermostat controls which respond slower than a cat breathing on you. No lobby whatsoever to speak of, in fact, it's downright depressing when you walk in. I totally agree with the other reviewer on this. Now if you've never been to a W, or a Ritz, or another good upscale chain, you'll think this place just swell. Those of you expecting a little more - head elsewhere! There is not one, and I repeat not one impressive thing here. Upon check in - very late at night - we were told there were no King beds left, even though we had requested one, with a crib. So instead we were given a room with double beds, and they brought a crib up. Now 2 double beds and crib makes the room feel completely claustrophic and tiny. Not good. The front desk gent did give us the kindness of putting us on a much higher floor. The 30th floor, which is not concierge level, but is a 'preferred floor'. I really hope these rooms are not the 'renovated versions'. That said, the relatively good points include - Location - the location is absolutely ideal for shopping buffs. And good dining abounds in the area. Service is prompt and the concierge is really nice. The beds are ok if you like puffy, but I miss my firm matress. Very hot water is plentiful and the pressure is great! The best is housekeeping will come until 4:30pm, so there is no pressure to get out of the room by 11am. This is a really, really big plus when traveling with an infant. Paid conference rate of $206, I think it's actually worth $175 p/night, but that's just me.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6582149">We were actually pleasantly surprised by our stay at the Sheraton in Seattle. We booked it through Priceline, where we "named our own price" - and we figured that we wouldn't get the best room or hotel - we were wrong. The room that we got was on one of the very top floors, beautiful views, extremely comfortable bedding and brand new decor in the room. We were also able to use their business center and use their internet access for free. The only down fall that I would have to mention is the cost for parking. The hotel is going through a bit of a transition, as they are building a new tower, but that had absolutely no effect upon our stay. We were able to walk everywhere downtown and felt that it was great for the money that we spent. I would reccomend this property to friends and I would return again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6556030">I've stayed at the Sheraton Seattle numerous times on business over the last 3 years. I used to really enjoy it, but it has progressively gone down hill in my opinion. Unfortunately,. my last stay will likely be my last, despite the location, which is closest to my office. This last visit the hotel was packed, so there was a huge wait to check in, even late at night, and with my SPG status. The room I received was one of the larger suites, but it was really just a huge waste of space. The layout of the furniture was spartan at best. Most disturbingly, the room reeked of mildew and the linens seemed old and tired, long overdue for replacement. This property is undergoing an expansion, so construction noise was also a problem. After 1 night, the mildew was aggravating my allergies, so i asked to be switched to a different room. The room I was moved to was tiny, cramped and dark, and the view looked out on to a lower rooftop, where at 6 am, a construction crew convened. At $279 a night, I expect more. I won't be staying at this Sheraton again anytime soon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6527906">The Seattle Sheraton is an old hotel (as far as hotels go), and a major renovation of the public areas and construction of a new a tower are underway with completion scheduled for May, 2007. In the meantime, hotel public areas are virtually nonexistent except for the mezzanine level on which meeting rooms are located. The carpeting in this expansive area, by the way, is a series of white rectangles on a dark background, and it was busy enough in appearance to almost make me dizzy! Reception is a temporary desk crammed into the corner of what was probably just a hallway leading to a side exit (temporarily the main entrance). If the lack of a grand stylish entrance bothers you, pick another hotel. Unfortunately, the Sheraton (Starwood) website does not disclose this information, so one's arrival at the hotel can be quite jarring and disappointing. Service, however, is very cordial especially under difficult physical conditions. The rooms seem more updated and well maintained. My partner and I stayed on the 32nd floor (club level) and had access to a nice lounge that provided evening wine and munchies as well as a large continental breakfast in the morning. Complimentary wireless internet access was available in the lounge and access in the room was via an ethernet link. The Sheraton bed is as comfortable as any with a fluffy duvet and silky smooth sheets. A very nice, though small, pool is located on the 35th floor; however, it was long enough to do laps. Next to the pool is a well equipped fitness room with up-to-date cardiovascular equipment. The only problem here is a lot of equipment crammed into a relatively small space. It was quite dramatic using treadmill while overlooking downtown Seattle from 35 floors up! I wouldn't consider dining at the Sheraton until construction is complete. A breakfast and dinner buffet are available in the Cirrus Lounge on the 35th floor, but it's clear this is being offered as a stopgap measure. There are many choices for restaurants at all hours very close to the hotel. (Parenthetically, I do remember coming to the Sheraton in the early 80's when one of Seattle's finest restaurants was located in the hotel. Perhaps that will happen again.) In summary, staying at the Sheraton isn't unpleasant. It just feels functional and not especially elegant, and this is all due to the hotel being in transition. Like a restaurant that has just changed chefs, judgement should be deferred until a later time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6517065">Be careful with this hotel. They will cheat you. When I called to make a reservation for a government conference I was told the hotel was completely sold out. I requested to be put on a waiting list and they took my name. A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate. I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called. They gave me the run around and said an opening came up. I asked if an an opening came up, why didn't they call me since I was on the waiting list. They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay. But they would not give me the government rate even though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did. There is major construction going on at this hotel. In addition, the hotel is not very nice. They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet. They only have one place to eat and the prices are outrageous for very average food. Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel. There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests. The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service. Avoid this hotel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR6127428">Great location, clean comfy stylish room, great service, nice views, but I was so put off by the $26 parking fee.

It hurt to cough up that money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6022859">We had reserved our room for five days, however we checked out after the first night. Let me first state the good things about this hotel. It has an incredible view of the city and the location can't be beat. These two things were not enough to make us stay in our room which had definitely seen better days. The bed actually sagged in the middle, not terribly, but enough to indicate that it was old and should be replaced. The carpets appeared worn as did everything else. There was a huge cigarette burn mark on the bathroom counter. Hopefully they will renovate when the new tower is finished.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5974913">The good - While requesting a view in Seattle can be fruitless - I didn't even realize I had a view of the bay until the day after I checked in, which was when the clouds lifted enough to see the ferry cruising through the grey water - it's also rewarding when the sun comes out. The room itself was warm (a first in my experience with hotel rooms, which tend toward the chilly side), and cozily decorated in sandy tones, with a very appealing bureau instead of the typical TV cabinet with bottom drawers. The room was clean and nicely turned out when we arrived, comfortable bathroom, closet, etc. The hotel employees I spoke to were all very pleasant. The hotel's in an excellent location for tourism - the Pike Street Market is a very easy walk down the street, and taxis are readily available nearby. There are three upscale malls of various sizes in the immediate area, with two large movie theatres, Borders, Barnes &amp; Noble, Williams Sonoma, Anne Taylor, the original Nordstrom's, Nordstrom Rack, and I would say every other high-end retailer on the planet is represented. While much of downtown is hilly, Pike Street is very walkable, and not at all steep. Grayline Tours has a desk in the lobby, and picks up at the hotel for tours and for airport shuttles, which is handy. The bad - The hotel pool, which is inside on the top floor, was ill lit and rather chilly. Obviously heated, but not very well. The jacuzzi was very nice, however. The soda machine on my floor and on the floor above me were both broken, and the ones which did work refused to function if you used change rather than bills. The rather pleasant little porch area on the corner entrance was closed Sunday night, as part of the construction going on at the hotel, forcing everyone to enter and exit the hotel through the badly designed main entrance. This is essentially a driveway where the taxis, limos and cars are constantly arriving and leaving, so it's a bit hazardous to navigate, especially since there's no pedestrian walk that extends down to the public sidewalk; you just have to hop off the apron near the hotel doors and hope an SUV isn't about to swing around the corner, which is pretty much blind since there's a construction overhang. The lobby area was dark and uninviting. I'm guessing the Chihuly sculpture I kept reading about was removed during the construction, for safekeeping. Summary: overall, a nice hotel but with a few bad spots. I'd be a little concerned about the entrance issue if I was elderly, or travelling with someone elderly or shaky/weak on their feet, as getting from the door to the sidewalk is clearly a bit dangerous.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5823268">My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton for two nights prior to our Alaska cruise. We booked it through Hotwire. Our stay was more than we expected. A great room. An upgrade to the 29th floor and very close to Pikes Market. It was only a $10 cab ride to get to the pier. We purchased a roundtrip ticket on the Airporter to the Sheraton. Then took a cab to and from the pier. It saved about $15, which isn't alot, but it was very convenient and the bus drivers are much more friendly than the cabbies. All-in-all, if you wnat to be close to the downtown action, this is a great hotel to pick.

It's apparent Sheraton has taken steps to minimize inconvenience during the construction. The construction wasn't a problem when I got to my room though. It was on a high floor as I requested and was located well away from the construction. I only wish the Club Lounge was open all day like those at Ritz-Carlton. I tend to sleep late and always miss out on the continental breakfast! The 35th floor pool and jacuzzi had excellent views. The jacuzzi didn't work, but it was nice to sit in anyway. I think they overcholorinate the pool though. It was nice to have changing rooms at the hotel pool; I don't like to wander through a grand hotel in my swimsuit on my way to/from the pool! Pike's Place Cafe used to have such wonderful regional cuisine; they've since replaced the menu there and for room service with the new Sheraton standard. I like to experience regional cuisine when I travel, but I must admit, the carrot cake on Sheraton's menu is to die for! Guest service at this property is intuitive. When I asked the front desk for the location of the nearest cellular telephone store so I could buy a new charger for my cell phone, the clerk produced a box of them from housekeeping. Apparently a lot of guests leave cell phone chargers in their rooms and he allowed me to pick out the one that matched from the box!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5512928">We stayed at the Seattle Sheraton for 5 nights.

The service was horrendous, the beds were improperly made, front desk had attitude. There was no concierge and the business center was not available because of construction. I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory and the service provided was unpleasant. The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected. The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel and we found our selves sleeping on the bare mattress (disgusting) when we woke up in the morning. The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness. The food in the restaurant was cold, service was slow, and each time I ate in there (the first when we didnâ€™t know any better and the 2nd 2nd time was because of the food coupons) - either the silverware was dirty or the water glasses and coffee cups were dirty, and expensive â€“ breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool, shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open and a house doctor was called. I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning and all they said was they were sorry. The noise from the construction was annoying at 6am and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available. Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz. bottle of water in the vending machine was ridiculous - the picture showed a full size water bottle. Horrible - absolutely horrible.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4964406">The hotel itself was in the heart of downtown, so for the price, it was great. However, i hate to be "nickle and dimed" for everything. The major flaw was the valet parking at $28.00 a day, a daily charge of $9.95 for internet service, and the biggest flaw was the heat. The thermostat would not go below 65 degrees, well some of you might think that is cool enough, but not on the 19th floor. There was no cross air, so it was warm adn stuffy. Also the vent was about 1 foot by 1 foot, so not much area to blow cool out from either. The room became a sauna when showering, so if you styled your hair, it would be ruined from all the moist heat and no fan in the bathroom. also this hotel is rated as a 4 star, which I highly doubt and even the quality linens they advertise were sheets that you could see though, no fitted bottom sheet, so we were fighting the mattress pad all night, and their towels had holes! That is not a 4 star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4953743">I've stayed at the Seattle Sheraton a couple of times. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They show little wear. The hotel is well suited for family or business travel. The hotel location is excellent, centrally located in downtown Seattle. Major construction just started this spring and is scheduled to be done in 2007. 400 rooms are being added in a new tower being built next to the existing tower. According to the hotel staff, this will make the Sheraton the largest hotel in Seattle. Parking is problematic. All self-parking at the hotel is gone. It's all valet, at $28.00 bucks a day. No additional parking is being added for the expansion, so once complete, parking could become a major headache.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4625822">If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel right in the middle of everything, then this hotel is for you. The first thing that I have to say about this hotel is that it isn't overly fancy, but the important things are there. The rooms are simple but very clean, beds are comfortable, and all the basic ammenities that you would need are available. For me, the best part about the hotel is where it is situated. There are restaurants and shopping galore right outside your doorstep. Pike Place Market is about a ten minute walk and for those of you that have never been there, I highly recommend you reserve some of your time to check it out. There are so many cool little shops with things that you probably wouldn't find anywhere else and the prices are pretty reasonable as well. Also, if you are wondering about where to go for a fantastic meal, I recommend going to The Cheesecake Factory which is basically right across the street from The Sheraton. Not only do they have about twenty different kinds of mouth-watering cheesecake to choose from, but they also have regular food as well with a fifteen page menu to choose from. We had the best waiter that I have ever had and he was completely honest with us about what was good on the menu and what was not so good and he made us feel like we had known him for years!If you decide to eat here I suggest that you either come early or eat late otherwise you will probably have at least an hour wait to get a table. One last thing I have to mention about the hotel is that they are undergoing construction until spring of 2007 so the outside is not that attractive right now and if you are going to book a room there I would maybe suggest that you ask for a room on another side. They automatically put us on another side and we did not hear a thing. There isn't anything that stood out about this hotel that was fantastic but there wasn't anything that was bad either so I would definately suggest a stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4131729">I travel for a living and this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005. The room was on climate control and it was very cold. On the first day,the shower pressure was so low that I couln't wash the conditioner out of my hair. The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold. It would not reach a warm temperature. When I asked the clerk at the front desk, he said that the hotel was under construction and all of the pipes were messed up. Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting. I did not have time to eat. I tried to have a quick cup of coffee but it was stone cold. I had to argue with the staff to take the meal off my bill. Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again, the staff argued. I spent two hours in the business center preparing business related emails. The center took my $50 and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties. When I approached the front desk for assistance, I was told that there was nothing they could do, and literally responded that it was not they're problem. Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order. It was explained that I was charged for items from the previous customer. When I questioned how they did this, the staff argued with me rudely and insulted me. A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it. I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card. The staff shugged their shoulders and stated that that was the way they did things. Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes. As someone who travels internationally, he commented on the rude and hostile behavior of the clerk. I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments. I also left a telephone message for him but he never returned my call. Not only would I never stay in this hotel again, but I will never patronize another Sheraton establishment.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4111435">I was a little nervous about staying in this hotel as it was not in Trip Advisor's top 10! but we got an excellent deal with Expedia when we booked it along with return flights from LA with Alaska Airlines.

It has gone downhill in recent years. The nice restaurant is gone (but there are many close to the hotel). The lobby and rooms were a little shabby. I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired. It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter. I didn't get a mini bar key at check-in, or for 3 hours after requesting one (and boy did I need a beer after being delayed on Alaska Air!). I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb. I got a $20 certificate for the inconvenience. Room service is very quick, but the quality is poor. Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet. I have catered events at this hotel and they used to be great. Can't beat the view on the 35th floor. This year the food was barely good. The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom. Rooms are very small. Beds are comfy.

The location really can't be beat if you are there for the conference center or for if you're just dithering around downtown Seattle and want to stay in slightly upscale digs. It's very easy to get to Mt. Rainier from there as well. Check-in was a bit of a wait but the staff person was nice. I know that it was a holiday weekend but the hotel was one of the conference hotels so it wasn't like they were ignorant of our arrival. Later on in the stay I had to go back twice at different times of day to talk to someone about splitting the bill with my colleague. I thought it was a bit strange that the staff was having such a hard figuring it out. Very polite, though. The in-house restaurant is ridiculous. For a cheap breakfast go up a block towards the Hilton hotel and there is a reasonable breakfast/lunch kind of place. The owner lived for a long while in Hawaii and has dressed up the place with photos and knick knacks from the place. Very yummy egg sandwiches and his pancakes have a nice hawaiian twist to them. ;) The bed was SO comfortable and the room was kept up each day. There is a mini fridge in the room but it is locked up due to all the goodies stored inside. We didn't eat anything from the fridge but asked for the key so that we could store our cheesecake slices from the Cheesecake factory right around the corner. By the way, the hotel is in an excellent location for casual shopping at Pike Market or two mall type places. The hotel is only one short block from the conference center. It is also within easy walking distance of the monorail that takes you out to the space needle and science fiction museum. I rarely use the concierge at any hotel but we did this time at two different times. One person made a reservation for us at the Space Needle restaurant (it revolves and the food is decent) and another gave us directions for getting to Mt. Rainier. Don't use the hotels computer room, though. If you didn't bring your computer and you want to check your email or make quick copies, just run over to the Kinko's in the conference center. The minute charges are 20cents cheaper. I never thought I would ever say that Kinko's was cheap but there it is.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3554657">I stayed at the Sheraton for four days in May 2005. The goods: Location: Great. Walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in the downtown area. Rooms: Really nice. Light soothing decor. Very comfortable bed with a variety of pillows. coffee maker. Concierge: Very helpful The bads: Elevators: -- not enough and very slow Coffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive. There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular. I only wanted oatmeal, juice and coffee so ordered from the menu. The bill was still $20. Desk staff: Well -- After being notified by phone message at 5:00p.m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching. I told the desk person to find it and I would pick it up after dinner. At 9 p.m. I asked again. After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message and there was no fax. I said I doubted that and said that I was expecting a fax. I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room. At 10:00 p.m. the fax was slipped under my door. It had actually been received at the hotel at 10:00a.m. on Thursday morning -- 36 hours before I received it. As it was after business hours there was nothing I could do about the important message that needed a timely response. I complained to the manager on duty the next morning and she did apologize and she credited $75 against my hotel bill. That did not compensate for the cost to me because I couldn't respond to the fax. Would I stay there again -- Maybe. It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3546924">I stayed here, for 6 days in October 2004, while at a convention. I brought my wife and toddler son. The location is incredibly convenient in downtown Seattle, close to the Convention Center, Pike's Marketplace and several restaurants. The front desk staff was less than cordial but provided us with the room we wanted in a reasonable amount of time. The room we received had a good view (we could see a little of Puget Sound) and was clean and comfortable. The facilities were well maintained and the pool was an added plus. Service (room service, bell staff, maid service, concierge) was friendly and excellent. On-site restaurants were over-priced, with unimpressive food and spotty service. The hotel was a little pricey, despite convention-associated discounts, but reasonable considering the overall consistent quality. Notably, on checking out there was a mistake on the bill (a mini-bar charge of &lt; $10) which was disputed and removed promptly, but without any type of apology for the mistake. Overall, the front desk again left me with a bad taste in my mouth that marred an otherwise decent stay. In sum, a great hotel with consistently excellent service which is family-friendly. It's a little pricey, considering the mediocre restaurant offerings, but a reasonable value. They probably need to monitor their front desk staff more carefully, who offer both the first impression and the last impression to customers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3544950">The hotel itself is in a great location.

A friend mentioned he had stayed for a very reasonable rate at a hotel called the SIXTH AVENUE INN. I found the hotel on Expedia and found the prices fit my budget, the amenities were excellent, the staff unfailing in their effort to please me and all suggestions of restaurants and clubs/pubs were spot on. The other members of my group who joined me at the hotel were completely impressed and still laud the hotel when our trip is brought up in conversation. A great feature is the hotels proximity to a fabulous gentlemans club, "lil darlings", at the foot of their parking lot. I will defiantly utilize this hotel when in Seattle for future sporting weekend trips with my friends. Top notch A+.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124943811">good location in down town short walk to Pike place and seattle center. We stayed here for two nights Feb. 18-19 with our two small children under 5. The hotel has a bad small to it when you walk in. The staff is very nice and rooms are clean but the hotel is an older one, the rooms are not as nice so seen in the pics also the bathrooms only have showers no baths at lease the room we stayed in didnt. The beds are ok, not that great &amp; they are small for two adutls. The coffee in the room is really good. The people who stay in the hotel are mainly young adults and college students. The hotel is very loud all night long. On the back side of the hotel is strip club so you hear the music til very late in the night. (If I would of know this we wouldnt of stayed because of the strip club due to small children) We went to buy a fan to keep the noise down because of the kids. People were in and out of the rooms and hall way on our floor so that made the noise louder. We paid $212 for both nights with $15 parking each night, which is crazy because we are already paying to stay in the hotel. I wasnt happy. We will not stay in the hotel again due to the fact of the noise with the kids but if you are alone or with a spouse it could be great. Also a car was broken into the last night we were there, so keep everything of value with you in your room!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124723171">This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel while working the Northwest Flower &amp; Garden Show. The Show is at the Washington State Convention &amp; Trade Center, about six blocks from the hotel, so location is great in that regard-don't have to drive in downtown Seattle! They have (some) covered, but not secure parking-it's open to the street, but I never had any trouble with my vehicle. This year they charged $15 a day for parking (which is not unusual in a big city) but last year not. Apparently there was a promo for free parking but our boss didn't get in on that-so check if there's any specials if you're going to an event. Westlake Avenue in on one side of the building and a strip joint on the other, but we never observed anything offensive. Just keep that in mind if you have kids! Room was clean, basic. We didn't know to request a microwave in advance, so make sure you do so when making the reservation. They have a very nice bar &amp; grill in the hotel, but if you're working a trade show for a week you probably don't have the energy for that. One young man at the front dest snotily offered that we could move our room rather than move a microwave in, but another kind gentleman (observing my jaw on the floor) assured us they could manage to move a small appliance in. Thank you James! Biggest problem was the maids apparently don't know how to count towels and don't know about the "hang your towel up if you want to re-use it" program. First night I requested an extra bath towel (girls with long hair need two!) We hung them up, but that night found the maid had taken our three towels and left only two clean ones. The "houseman" Carlos promptly brought another; I got to know Carlos quite well as we went through this a few nights in a row. I got to be known as the Towel Lady. Best part of this place is the staff. I forgot my personal pillow when packing up. Called the next day and they promptly returned my call having found it. They do charge shipping to return forgotten items, but that's pretty normal. At least they're honest. Julia at the front desk is awesome!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122878317">Very shady place! I cannot recommend this hotel at all. My room door did not lock properly, the bathroom was absolutely disgusting and dirty upon my arrival, the elevator got stuck several times during my stay (and of course had no inspection sticker whatsoever) and when I asked them to call me a taxi cab to the airport, a car arrived that was not labeled as a taxi, had no meter in it, the driver had no id, taxi license, or permit but still tried to charge me $5 more for a trip to the airport than the local yellow cabs. I booked the room to avoid the high costs of the conference hotels nearby, but I will never make this mistake again. Even their cheap rates were overpriced for the rooms and service they offer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR122251223">I have been staying at Sixth Avenue Inn every month for 2+ years. I am an "older" graduate student at Antioch University, and this has been my â€œhomeâ€� when in Seattle. The Belltown location is fantastic â€“ lots of great restaurants, 5 blocks to Whole Foods, easy walking distance to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, Downtown, Seattle Center and the Space Needle, and a transit hub at Westlake to get anywhere in the city you need to go. But the most important quality is the staff â€“ I cannot praise them highly enough! From my first stay there, everyone has gone out of their way to make sure I have everything I need. From the front desk, to the restaurant, to maintenance and housekeeping, to management, they provide 5-star (maybe 6-star) service â€“ better than I often get in so-called luxury hotels (I travel a lot on business). If you want a modest, spotlessly clean, well-located city location for your Seattle stay, with a welcome that makes you know that they are TRULY glad you are there, check out the Sixth Avenue Inn!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119490347">We have stayed in Seattle once before and made the mistake of staying too far away from the centre. We found the Sixth Avenue Inn to be a reasonable compromise between location and the price we had to pay. Hence we were not too surprised when the room looked a little tired. Don`t get me wrong, it did everything it needed to do well enough, but the carpet was ready for replacement and the bathroom needed redecorating. None of it was BAD, just past its best. Our only gripe was that previous reviews had suggested asking for a 6th. Ave side room to avoid the noise from the "Gentlemen`s Club" behind the property. However the road noise was pretty loud. I don`t think the windows were double glazed - if they were they were from a different era. However, apart from that it did the job perfectly well and we would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a hotel room at a reasonable price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119377716">A small, unassuming place, located in the downtown area. Stores, upscale restaurants, coffiee shops, Pike Place Market and other attractions are within walking distance. There's a nice little restaurant on site and the food we had was good (the local constabulary frequent this place so the food and service must be decent). The staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are basic and a little dated, but they're clean and the beds comfy. There's some traffic noise at night, altho it didn't keep us awake. We've stayed here more than once and have found the place totally acceptable. We walked everywhere and the buses run nearby. I would recommend it to those who are on a tight budget or who would like to park the car for the time they're in the city.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119303882">The main draw of this hotel would be price and location. It's within several blocks of the terminus of the airport train and within six blocks of the waterfront area. Pretty good location considering. This is an old hotel that has not been renovated, per se, but kept up in most regards. The staff is upbeat and helpful, although a little quirky. For example, when my key woudn't get me into the small workout room, the front desk staff advised me to tell the maintenance guy that he neeeded to rekey the door on the workout room. Then the maintenance guy told me that front desk guys really just didn't code my key right. Whatever. The workout room is a brutally uninspiring room with a total of three machines (bike, treadmill, and stairclimber). There is a pay-per laundry, which is convenient. I found the bed very comfortable and there is a small desk in the room, but it is not well outfitted for business. For example, I found only one outlet within reach of the desk. When I plugged my phone charger in a wall socket, it would fall out due to the weight of the plug. The place as been around for awhile. There's an on-site restaurant and bar, which is cozy and convenient. Don't expect fine cuisine. This is food that likely comes from some sort of premade service. Considering the range of good restaurants in walking range, I'd recommend something else based on my experience. There's a McDonald's right next door if you want cheap. Basically, this is a bland property, with not much to recommend it and not much to disparage it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119302814">We just wanted a cheap stop over place before starting out on our journey to Yellowstone.

However, maybe due to the high occupancy or who knows why, the service this year was much worse. We came back to our room everyday to find some unpleasant surprise, like something had not been done by the maids. We let it go when it wasn't really disrruptive. However, the last day, we found that the beds had been only half-made. We went to the front desk to complain, and had to show the pictures we had taken from the room so as to prove our point. The person in the frontdesk wasn't impressed either, but there was nothing they could/would do about it. He tried to convince us that we might have left the "do not disturb" sign at the door, which wasn't the case. Something had been done around the room like rearranging the towels, and so on, but the beds weren't completely made and the pillows were lying on the floor to our disgust. We were told that the manager would contact us back, but I'm still waiting (since the beginning of July, so I do not think this will even happen). I said last year that we couldn't wait to book with them for the years to come, but unfortunately, I think this was the last time we will have ever stayed at this hotel, as we found that the quality level has dropped dramatically and there are better options around for about the same price.

My friend has some dietary restrictions and they tried very hard to work with the chef to accomodate her needs. I had heard about the "gentlemen's club" behind the hotel and was a bit worried about the noise so I asked for a room on the Sixth Avenue side. Fifth floor was quiet with just the usual city street noises in the morning, but being downtown I expected that. Hotel is non-smoking, which I appreciated, so don't stay here if you smoke.

This one ended up being $155 per night + $15 per night parking. The room had a queen bed that was comfortable. A flat screen TV which was nice. The rest of the room seemed older. The carpet was at best so so. The bathroom, specifically the shower was horrible. No bathtub at all, was a stand up shower with OLD tile. It looked like an old Gym shower. On the morning I was leaving I just skipped the shower. The wallpaper was starting to peel back in spots in the bathroom and there was black mold forming underneath it. The toilet seemed newer. The sink seemed newer but the handles on the sink where odd. One would face East/west when on or off and the other faced North/south. Its like whoever installed it didnt know how to put the handles on. Going back to the bed. It was decently comfortable but I found it odd that there was no comforter on it at all. It was 1 Sheet, 1 very thin blanket and then another sheet on top of that which I suppose was acting as the comforter. Was wierd. They did offer free internet that was VERY slow. Dialup slow. I was able to connect to the building across the streets internet which was much faster. Dont count on the hotels internet if you actually want to do anything. Overall, you are paying for location. 20 Minute walk to the waterfront, reasonable walk to the space needle.

The Sixth Avenue Inn was just the place for us.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116148374">I really appreciated the free cookies available at the front desk when we checked in at 11pm. They were probably the most impressive part of my entire stay, but that's not really a disappointment when you're paying just over $60 a night for a room in such a central location. The 6th Ave is the only survivor among a number of classic motor inn type establishments formerly available in this area, the others have been converted into dorms for Cornish College. Call them directly and they usually have something available well below market rate for the neighborhood. Like I said, though, it's acceptable but absolutely nothing beyond. The decor was probably original and not very attractive. The bathroom was clean. The bath/shower combo featured permanently installed product dispensers and scaldingly hot water. Noise travels a lot, especially if you have your windows open. Not my favorite place, but good for what it is.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116111012">Although the hotel looks like a mid-rise sixties hotel from the outside, our room was clean, large and bright with comfortable mattresses and a renovated bathroom. It was a terrific value given it's location a few blocks from Pike Place Market. Although, there's just a small lobby and desk, the attached restaurant was comfortable with a well-balanced menu, attentive waitresses and comfortable, clubby interior. Although, we used it for only a one-night stay before a cruise, it would certainly be fine for staying a few days and sightseeing because of its great location. Major chain hotels nearby were much pricier with amenities we did not require for this trip.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115934770">Family of 4 stayed here 3 nights in June.

Not only is the hotel in a seedy part of town, but the hotel itself is not clean or inviting at all.The first room we were given, after we hauled all our luggage up to it on a luggage cart, smelled like mold and mildew and decay. We changed rooms, hauling our luggage to the next room. It smelled a little better, but still had a view of a strip club and sketchy people walking. The sirens and motorcycles went most of the night, and the old style air conditioning unit was loud and cycled on and off all night. Do not stay at this hotel unless you go there and check it out first.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115713889">We have stayed at this hotel before in 2003 and '07. It was good then but it looks like the owners have not invested a penny in the property. Very slow internet, carpets worn, signs of plumbing repairs visible in the room. Biggest pain was the key system. This one was very picky. The only staff who could consistently open the door on the first try were the maids. Everyone else either failed and got so frustrated that they ran to get a Master key, or something that wold get us in our room. Were we never able to successfully open the door!! We won't be staying there anymore. Friends said we should check out the Holiday Inn Express.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115705678">Like the other reviews, the location of the hotel is excellent. Walking distance (6 blocks) to Pike Place and the Waterfront and probably walking to the Space Needle (we didn't attempt). My son is 5 and he walked everywhere with us. You can take the Monorail, which is about a 7 minutes walk, to the Space Needle. We stayed 4 days and used our car only once, to drive out to Gas Works Park. Our room was on the backside, facing gentleman's club. The windows are thin, but we didn't hear anything. We stayed over a Saturday night, too. I say this room is "Very Good for the Effort" because it is clear that the staff has put a lot of energy into making this decent hotel. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. From the outside, it looks shabby. However, the lobby was comfortable, although small. Our room was large and the beds were comfortable. 99% of it was clean. Unfortunately, there was mold on the ceiling in the bath. There was also a foul smell in the hallway two nights in a row. But, we weren't sleeping in the hallway - just something my husband and I noticed when we walked from the elevator to our room. The weather was mild, but I tested the AC and it seemed to run quietly. Not sure if there was a smell, though. We would probably stay here again because of the price. It was worth it to be so close to everything.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115620227">Because there wasso much to see and do in Seattle, this place really was just a great place to park our car.

McDonald's is right next door for a quick breakfast.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115539952">We stayed for 3 nights after a cruise and arrived around 10 am. Our room was ready for us, no waiting around. Reception staff were knowledgeable and friendly, especially as the hotel was busy with the International Lions Convention. We had no problem with noise from outside or inside and our room was at the front of the building. The rooms are quite spacious, with a fridge and coffeemaker. The beds are really comfy and the bathroom spotlessly clean. Great location for shopping, Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle (we walked there and took the monorail back). We were able to use the computers free of charge to do on-line check in and also print out our boarding cards - amazing considering what you have to pay for this service elsewhere. We used the lightrail to get to and from the airport, another amazing bargain. We only used taxis to and from the port. The subway is less than 5/10 mins walk and there's also a lift - useful when you have luggage. There was no pressure to vacate our room although we were ready to leave on time and our luggage was stored free of charge until we left for the airport. We only used the restaurant once for breakfast and were happy with what we ordered. Again, the staff are friendly and helpful.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115420876">We stayed at this hotel for one night before a Cruise. The hotel's location and price, including how close it is to the attractions downtown and to the Seattle light rail were all big positives when we were considering which hotel to pick. We were assigned a room facing the "club" that is next door, and that club was very loud throughout the night. The noise stopped at about 4am Saturday morning. I'm not sure if that "club" is that loud every Friday night, or if our night (June 24) was an exception. The hotel itself was great; there is no free breakfast, but there is a McD's very close by that of course serves a decent hot breakfast for a decent price. The room had an in-room safe, and the staff was helpful in getting us into our room a little earlier than the official checkin time. They also gave us a late checkout, which we appreciated. Overall, we had no complaints regarding the hotel or its operations itself; the complaints we have were about the loudness of the club that is next door. I'm sure people staying at the other nearby hotels likely also had our complaint that night. There also are two internet enabled computers for free usage in the lobby. I would consider staying at this hotel again, but not on a Friday or (I'm guessing) Saturday night. I'd also stay away from other hotels in this area for the same reasons on Friday and (likely)Saturday nights.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115406810">This is a great hotel.

This property offered that. We were in walking distance with 6 year olds to the local attractions. The staff was extremely courteous and went out of their way to ensure everything was ok. The beds were not comfortable, but for a short stay it didn't matter. The onsite restaurant offered good food at a reasonable price. Free WIFI is a plus. The hotel offers soap, lotion and shampoo in a dispenser for the Eco-conscious consumer. If you are looking for luxury, this is probably not your spot, but if you need a place to stay in town while you're waiting on your cruise to take off or for a few days this property will work.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114326598">Great location, clean rooms, staff a bit confused but in a nice way :) We get some special vacation offer and we get free great breakfast and free parking.

We walked everywhere (Space Needle, Pike Place Market etc) What I found even more convenient was that you can take the light rail directly from the Seattle airport to just outside the hotel. Prob about a five minute walk from where you get off the train. Staff were extremely helpful, very friendly and provided much needed info on the city of seattle. Room was basic. Nothing fancy. But very CLEAN which is always important to us when we travel. I gave it 3 stars because that's exactly what we expected and exactly what we got (considering this is a 3 star hotel) although I must say the staff and service were 5 star all the way!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR113718245">We would defenitely stay there again. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Our room looked like the advertisment. They do need to get hypoallergenic pillows, they have feather pillows which I'm allergic to. The bus stop is a couple blocks away and its also part of the free bus zone meaning: you can ride it for free. For Seattle you won't find a better hotel for the price. For breakfast we went into the Bar and Grill. The staff were very friendly and prompt with service. We had a muffin and cereal so I can't comment on the rest of the menu however, it was busy while we were there, which is usually a good indication that the food is good. The decor was also nice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR111208700">The good: Location is very good. The not so good: As other people have said the rooms are clean kind of refurbished in the sense they are painted but not remolded you still get that youâ€™re in motor lodge and very old hotel. Booked two nights on Hotwire 2 star for $85 a night. The hotel bar dead, bad wine choices in the sense wine by the glass is like two choices and cheap wine. The very bad: I booked this hotel because I was traveling to Seattle and wanted to do some bike riding and most times it is easier to stay at a smaller hotel such as this. For $10-$20 more though on Hotwire you can stay at a 3-4star such as Westin etc. would recommend that. But where the bad takes place is the hospitality; I have traveled all over the world with my bikes for twenty years so when I was checking in I asked if I could leave my case here (which is the size of a suite case airline regulation size) and another suite case while I travel around for a week and I will book a room right now for my return day at whatever the rack rate was which I think was $98. The front desk guy told me they really only store luggage for 24hrs. but I can ask the manager tomorrow. The next day waited to speak and caught up with him and he informed they cannot store my suite cases for a week that they do not have the room. Even though when I was speaking with him they have shelves half empty with suite cases and I seen their laundry maintenance area next to the elevators with plenty of room. I completely understand that no hotel has room if every guest wanted to store stuff for a week. But come on throw it in a corner somewhere and make me sign something that your not liable if that is the issue. Now for where my trip got good again and you see the true hospitality of Seattle people and and other hotel chains why their so successful. I figured let me walk up the street about 8 blocks to the Marriott Spring Hill Suites I walk in the door and am greeted excellent I ask the gentleman working the front desk I ask the gentleman that I was bike ride and tour over the next week and I need to leave my suite cases somewhere for a week I will make a reservation for next week for the night of my return would it be possible to leave them here. First words out of his mouth â€œAbsolutelyâ€� I say they are two large suite cases is that ok â€œnot a problemâ€� no matter what I said this guy was going to satisfy me. Next day dropped my cases off walk in told a different front desk clerk I have a reservation wanted to leave these hear for a week again â€œno problemâ€� not once did they flinch about them, have to get their manager they were empowered to satisfy the guest. The bar also at this location Marriott location is happening the drinks are good priced right what else can you say and to top it off the room was free as I turned in Marriott miles. I tipped the bell hop / valet guy $1 a day per bag for storage so 5 days I gave him $10 for two bags and he was like let me get you change I said no you guys stored them all week for me and he says sir that is no problem â€œthank you very muchâ€�. Bottom-line stay somewhere else with better hospitality, not as run down older property, better bar. Would never stay here again and would not recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR110866968">We depend a great deal on this web site when we choose hotels for our trips. Trip Advisor didn't fail us this time either! Great value! The room was spacious. We had a choice between a room with a tub/shower combination or a shower stall alone. We traveled with another couple. Their room was as nice and bright as ours. The staff was great! Very efficient and helpful. There is a restaurant on location. We ate breakfast there and dinner there one night. Excellent place to eat. Great atmosphere. Within walking distance to Pike Place Mkt (even with walking up and down hills). Also within walking distance to the Space Needle - flat terrain. We came into town from the airport on the Light Link Rail line. It cost less than $3 per person and took about 1/2 hour.

The Sixth Avenue Inn is conveniently located in downtown Seattle. It is walking distance from the Space Needle, Pike's Market, many restaurants, and stores. The bus in the area is free from certain times and up to certain streets. The drivers are very helpful. Back to Sixth Avenue Inn....The room was clean with double queen beds and lots of space. We also got a microwave and little refrigerator, which we requested when making reservations. A flat panel TV, coffeemaker, blowdryer, iron, ironing board, and closet safe were standard in our room without requesting. The front desk staff were always very pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful with directions or any questions we had. They even gave us several maps to help us in our walking adventures. The fresh cookies were an awesome bonus! The hotel restaurant located on the second floor honors take out orders which we made good use of. The pleasant restaurant staff delivered our food to our room as we enjoyed a few drinks at the bar while waiting for our take out order. The only negative thing was the heavy footed neighbors upstairs. We could hear them walking around every once in a while. Overall we would definitely stay there again and recommend this Inn to others.

I chose this hotel because it was relatively cheap ($85/night) and the location seems great for where we needed to be. Note that this is a budget hotel so everything is very basic. Pros: The location is fairly central so we were able to walk everywhere. The employees were all friendly and extremely helpful. They offer free wi-fi; the room comes with a fridge and microwave; and parking is cheap for Seattle standards at $15/day. Cons: Paper thin walls, so thin, we were kept awake by our neighbours talking (not yelling, but talking) 'til the wee hours of the morning (5AM). The water pressure in the shower is not the greatest. I think the windows were NOT double glazed, so there was not much insulation from the noise outside, but this did not really bother us as we are used to city noise (in fact, it seemed quieter than what we are used to living in downtown Vancouver). Would I stay here again? Probably not, especially if I can get a 4* hotel on Priceline for approximately the same price. I actually feel terrible for saying this because the staff were nothing but helpful, friendly, and amazing. Too bad about the paper-thin walls and lack of water pressure - these are possible deal breakers for me because I need my sleep and a hot steamy shower.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR99450603">We stay in downtown Seattle 5 or 6 times a year. When we're on a budget, this is THE place. It's just a 950 foot walk to Westlake Center, and minutes to Pike Place Market, or anywhere else downtown. A walk back from Pioneer Square took about 18 minutes. This time we got rates of: $76.46 for Friday and $71.58 on Saturday night (I believe I asked for either a AAA or Government rate), before fees. The $15 parking is also a great deal for downtown Seattle. The Lounge/Restaurant is adequate, and room service was quick. I'll let the pictures speak for the room itsel...well, ok, I will add that it was clean, nice size, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. This place can not be beat for value and location. PS. My wife asked to mention that the in room toiletries come out of a dispenser, which some folks may not like. The dispenser says that it may save 1000 soap and shampoo bottles each year.

The hotel was easy to find in a central location. The hotel is quite dated starting with the entrance and main check in desk. The halls are musty, and reminded me of visiting my grandmothers old apartment. The location is poor with a clear view of a strip club and adult shop across the parking lot from our room. The crowd roaming the streets were very undesireable. The room was in disrepair, with a hole in the bathroom door, old furniture, and a very dated bathroom. The rest of the room was adequate and the beds were good. Ticking and clicking air vents kept my family up for several hours. Security brought up ear plugs which helped some of us. We checked out and did not stay the second night. It is time to tear this hotel down and rebuild.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR76890321">I was in Seattle twice in July. The first time I stayed at the Red Lion and loved it; great views, good room, well located. And it had the price to go with all of that. So when I had to go back two weeks later I wanted to stay someplace that was much less expensive. After checking the reviews I selected the Sixth Ave. Inn and was happy with my choice. First, be clear that this hotel is exactly what is described, a budget hotel. It's a good budget hotel but it's not more than that. The front desk staff was great, no one with attitude there! The rooms were not large and are not modern, at least by my standards. However, the two rooms I rented were very clean. I also have to hand it to the hotel for being responsive to guest's concerns. I emailed the hotel when I made the reservations and asked that my rooms be as quiet as possible as this is important to me. Our rooms were reasonably quiet (for a downtown location). I can see that some rooms might get street noise so if this is of concern to you then let the hotel know ahead of time. I was also concerned about the "gentlemen's club" that is mentioned in several reviews, as I was booking one of the rooms for a relative that I was meeting in Seattle. Our rooms didn't look that direction but I have to say that it wouldn't have bothered me if they had. The "club" is in the next building but it isn't like it's right against the hotel, there is a bit of separation. Things that may raise eyebrows: first, the outside of the building is painted concrete block (at least that's what it appears to be). The building is well maintained generally (there were a few missing tiles in my bathroom but it appears that repair work had recently been done and the tiles not yet re-installed). One thing that I didn't particularly care for were the wall dispensers for the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc. That's personal preference and for the money I was saving I could live with it. In the two rooms that I rented there were no bathtubs, only showers (fine by me). I will also have to say that the air conditioning in our rooms worked great. I happen to hit Seattle during hot spells both times. The a/c at the Red Lion was okay but the a/c at the 6th Ave. could really chill a room. Bottom line: it's a very well run budget hotel. The location is great and I do mean great; we walked everywhere except for the brief ride on the monorail. The staff all seem to have an interest in their guests. If you time your afternoon visit to the front desk just right you'll also get a warm cookie.

You can got to Westlake centre on the 3rd floor for a meal as it has a food court there, and Mc Donalds next door (but the staff there is so rude and unfriendly. The room was large and comfortable the only negative thing is that on our floor the smell was not so pleasant on the corridor as you get out of the lift. We were pleasantly surprised that we had a microwave, fridge, coffe maker to which we had coffee replenished daily. There was also a drink dispenser on our floor and the cost was.40cents cheaper that outside. fantastic place with great value for money. do not be put off by me saying about the smell on the corridor. Everything was in order. Had a good time. There is not much to do here if you have travelled before as the activies lik e the aquarium, etc is the same as every where else so I say 2 days is enough for a short visit.

Unfortunately when we arrived, the hotel had given us two single-bed rooms instead of ones with two-queen beds. The room director had said that 3rd party companies promise a room-type, when in fact it's just a room-request -- actual availability can only be guaranteed by the Hotel. We've booked via companies like Priceline, Expedia, Travelocity and hotwire for 10 years and have never had this excuse given to us; besides, when the invoice specifically stated that we had selected a room with two-queen beds as opposed to one, it really is not supposed to be the customer's problem to deal with. Because the Sakura-con Anime convention was happening that same weekend, the entire hotel was booked solid. Management had offered us roll-away beds, but room service ran it up to the wrong suite. Since our key-cards kept demagnetizing, we ended up taking several trips to verify this. In the end, they refunded us one day's parking fee for our troubles ($15) after some lengthy discussion at the front-desk. Location was nice, within blocks to dining (Dahlia Lounge/Lola/Pacific Kitchen) and about sixth blocks walk to Pike's Market/shopping. There is a Mcdonald's right across the street for convenience. However, our rooms were facing a strip club next door. Walls &amp; windows weren't insulated enough -- We could hear outside ambulance/police sirens, and talking/speaking in the hallways. Having seen four rooms, we found that there was inconsistency in how the rooms were setup: some had fridges while some didn't, some had different placements for AC plugs, and all had three pillows per bed (not four) Parking is $15 for downtown, about standard. Free internet wifi was a plus. Primarily due to the hotel booking mixup, we will not be staying here and advise our friends/family to avoid this hotel in their Seattle stays. There are simply too many other options elsewhere downtown to overlook this experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR59196633">We stayed for 3 nights in a standard room. Although the view wasn't fancy the rooms were clean, modern and the staff were friendly. There was a restaurant downstairs that was nice enough if you didn't feel like going out. With the price we paid I expected a dingy room with staff that didn't care and not the best cleaning -- this really exceeded my expectations. The location was great (just across the road from the Westin) and it was close enough to both the space needle and the shops downtown. The markets were a little walk, nothing difficult though and even in the rain it wasn't a problem. They had a nice little room downstairs where you could use the internet and printer. The combination of clenliness, friendly staff and great location made this a stand out bargain for me. I would def stay here again.... unless I won the lotto and decided to upgrade!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR57166730">great location, friendly staff, big rooms but if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs.

The location of the hotel is great, we were originally going to stay somewhere near the space needle but were glad that we choose this location instead. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food and service at the bar/restaurant was great and the meals are value for money plus they do room service. The room itself was clean and comfortable. It's not the newest or most upmarket hotel in town but it was a great base and place to sleep. I would recommend it to other travellers looking for good, cheap accommodation in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56217780">I got a good last minute deal and had a nice clean room - nothing fancy, but better than a Motel 6 or Super 8. Great location downtown, within walking distance to department stores and 10 minutes to Pike Place Market. Very friendly staff. However, both mornings I awoke to the sounds from the ceiling above me, hearing footsteps and TV noises nearby. Seems like the building has a cheap wooden construction with bad sound isolation. Without ear plugs, you cannot sleep late, which is the main reason I went there in the first place...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR55196241">We stayed there on a 3-day-city-trip to Seattle. Generally speaking, the motel itself exceeded my expectations. For a motel in this price class it was exceptionally clean, comfortable and well-equipped. Furthermore, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful in a way I rarely have seen before. Great experience! The guys at the front des can supply you with the best local information. The motel is comfortably close to downtown, which is great for sightseeing. However, this makes it also a bit noisy. They also have a wifi-hotspot, but beware: the signal strength at the 5th floor is horrible. In that case you should go to the lobby or the free business center. The only VERY negative thing: it seemed to be kind of a party motel. We experienced an extremely high noise level during the nights until 5 am every night. Partying room neighbors, drunk people in and outside the hotel. I slept maybe 2 hours each night!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR53969572">We stayed at the 6th Avenue Inn for three nights when we were starting a road trip from Seattle to Las Vegas. It's a fairly short walk from the coach station which makes it cheap to get to from the airport and manageable even with a fair amount of luggage. There are also some great bars a few streets away, although it's a schlep to the main part of town (we only walked it a couple of times). The room itself was large and reasonably clean, although the shower was not exactly powerful. My one issue was with the staff - not particularly friendly or helpful, took far too long to check us in (there were two staff on duty, neither of whom paid us any attention for 15 minutes so we were stood like lemons while they both appeared to be checking the computer for a while). No recommendations about local places to go or eat - the small lobby has some leaflets but we were looking for advice about a local restaurant. Ended up walking and finding somewhere great anyway. Fabulous trip and we'll go back to Seattle again - but we're not staying here. Other places in the area offered much better service and nicer rooms for a similar rate.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR52174296">I was not sure just what to expect from this hotel. I had read great reviews and not so great reviews. I was not disappointed. The hotel was very clean throughout. Appeared to be new carpet, paint, etc. The hotel staff was excellent, the on site restaurant and lounge were very nice and the breakfast fantastic. Free WiFi that was excellent (wireless starting next week). Within walking distance of everything I wanted to see. I had no issue with street noise but I could see where this could be a problem as sound does seem to carry through the windows very easily. The hotel is only 5 stories so you are not very high above noise if it is there. Like I said it was not an issue for me. If you are on a budget or just want to save your money for the great food in the city I would highly recommend this hotel.

You get what you pay for, it's a no frills, low bidget place. Front desk staff was trying to help a large group when we checked in so they were a bit overwhelmed but otherwise I had no issues with them. The windows in the rooms appear to be single-paned so yes you will hear all the traffic noise outside. There was only 1 thin blanket on the bed, so we asked for a second one. The heating unit is old so it didn't work that great but it also wasn't that cold at night. The bathroom vent was LOUD, but there was a second light in the bathroom so I didn't need to hear the vent everytime the light was on. The bathtub is small and the showerhead was so low I had to bend over to wash my hair. There was maybe 6 drawers and 6 hangers so plenty of room to put away our clothes. No safe in the room but we didn't have a need for one. The iron looked new/barely used and the full-size ironing board was nice to iron clothes. Parking is $15/night and seemed secure enough, I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood at night. There is a McDonald's right across the street and a Starbucks 1 block over. We didn't eat in the restaurant since the breakfast prices looked a bit high.

They did not tell us we could get there easily for $2.50 per person on the new light rail--we located it on our own and it was great and convenient to the hotel.

To be honest we weren't expecting much, for only $104 a night we didn't really know what we were getting. We were suprised when we arrived, the lobby is very nice, the staff is nice and informative as well. Our room was clean and relaxing. After coming back from the baseball game we went to the lounge for a couple drinks, the bartender was excellent. She was very helpful and had offered very quick service. She didn't kick us out right at closing time either, she let us sit and enjoy our drinks with the other people that were there. I noticed that in another post it mentions the gentlemen's club just across the street. Well there was no noise from there, it was quiet. And if you pay much attention to the streets in Seattle there are actually quite a few of those places around, so it's not a reflection of the hotel itself.

Every morning there was even a complimentary Seattle Times newspaper on the door. It is a great hotel, very well located, at a really good price for downtown Seattle. The only bad detail, is that the walls are a little bit thin, as a result sometimes it is possible to hear your neighbors. For the price, this place is very hard to beat. Great location, friendly and helpful staff and clean, comfortable rooms. I highly recommend it, for the budget oriented traveler.

We chose this based on its location - the cheapest available in the area! Location: Excellent. Five minutes to the downtown shopping district. about 15 minutes from Pike's Place Market. However there is a gentlemen's club at the back side of the hotel and the area may not be that safe to walk around late at night. Amenities: Exercise room is minimal but equipment is functional. No cleaning agent for wiping down the machines after use though. Room: Old but adequate. The bath tub is really narrow and small. Problems with dialing outside calls. Complimentary internet access but the wire (wire only, no wi-fi) is very, very short and is awkwardly located in between two beds...

It is within walking distance of almost anything you would want to see or do making it safe to party without worrying about who is going to drive. The rooms are incredibly outdated but if you can see past the decor, this is your hotel. The bells and whistles are kept to a minimum, which may be why the price is lower than some of the larger hotels. The restaurant on the lower level is a cool spot to grab a bite and drinks. The ambiance on the bar side is is a lot like the bar in the movie National Lampoon's Vacation. Dark yet comfortable. If the fire is not lit, ask them to...it makes it so much better for late night drinks. Be sure to leave extra time when checking out as a lot of people tend to leave around the same time and the one person behind the desk gets busy fast.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR32653812">Fast check in. Love the wall of windows in the room. Very comfortable, large room convenient to attractions. Good, secure internet connection. The bed was ok, but not great. Street noise can be a little loud so you may need earplugs if you aren't used to it. Ralph's grocery was just two blocks away for room snacks. The happy hour at the hotel was very romantic in front of the fireplace (with the air conditioning on!). Keep in mind that there is $15 a day car parking fees. The free bus definitely is an experience to see lots of unusual people. We were warned about crime in the area and there were lots of pan handlers close by the hotel as well as lots more in the Pioneer Square area. We did the 3 hour Gray Line segway tour and loved it.

The woman at the desk commented that "this has been a non-smoking hotel since I've worked here for a couple of years," so this doesn't make much sense. (Esp. since I've now read the management's comments here that they just took over in Oct. '08 and transitioned to a non-smoking hotel.) However, she moved us to a different room and was very pleasant about it. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. The location is very good - walking distance to Pike's Place market, Monorail, and Space Needle, as well as some good restaurants. The beds were comfortable but the room overall was rather shabby, with stained carpet and scuffs on the wall. The bath contained the narrowest tub/shower I've ever encountered in this country, and the "hot" water ranged from warm to occasionally cold - the temperature varied during my shower. During the first morning's shower I discovered there was no shower gel and almost no soap in the dispenser, so we hunted down the housekeeping staff in the hall and asked her to refill them so my travelling companion could take her shower. Again, this was done politely and cheerfully. I was also surprised to learn of the fee for parking, although now I see that info buried on the "amenities" page. Overall, it's a great location and a decent night's sleep, so if you don't look too closely at your surroundings it's OK. The next trip we would probably inquire if the rooms had been refurbished, or consider another low-price chain hotel in the area next time.

It was on their list of budget motels close to the pier and downtown. I had read TripAdvisor reviews, but not knowing Seattle and on a limited budget, I agreed to the booking. I am sorry I did. I was traveling with my tween daughter and reserved a double double. The elevator was cramped with worn carpet on the floor and walls. Upon entering the room, we both noticed an odd odor. The carpet was worn and had stains. The bedspreads had stains. The beds were somewhat comfortable, but lumpy. The fan was so squeaky, I had to turn it off by unplugging it from the wall. There were no polarized plugs in in the room. The TV was plugged in with an adapter and on a extended outlet addition. The paint was worn and chipped in several areas. The bathroom had chips in the paint over the tile and the shower/tub wall had peeling paint. To top it off, all double double rooms overlook a 7th Avenue business called "Little Darlings" "an intimate gentleman's club". When I asked to be changed to another room, the staff informed me that the best they could do was to put me in a queen room with a roll away.

Definitly on the short list for future stays in town.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16776015">We booked our flights to Seattle as a package and got a great deal! $660 for two people, three nights, and airfare, but we didn't have a choice as to where we were to stay. The hotel itself if old and kind of stinky. I refused to go in the elevator because it was a bit decrepit and smelled of vomit, and the stairways smelled like pee, but the room itself was quite clean, though very bare. We walked all over the city many times over, as the location of the hotel is superb. You're in Belltown so there are tons of cute places to eat or drink, and you're right next to downtown with a plethora of chain clothing stores. I don't know that I'd stay there again, but it was certainly sufficient for our low budget, last minute, long weekend trip.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16716506">The location is great; right behind the Westin &amp; next to a McDonalds, within walking distance to downtown &amp; the monorail. The outside it looks like an older small Motel, but inside it's as good as any mid-level (think Holiday Inn). It has a resturant that's a bit pricy, but the food is good quality and the atmosphere's great with it's wood burning fireplace. Nice place to be during a gray day in Seattle. I booked through my airline so I could get milage points, but I would highly reccommend it to anyone.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR16665860">We visited Seattle for 6 days at the end of May 2008. A fancy hotel is not important to us but we do require a safe and clean place to stay. The Sixth Avenue Inn was just what we needed - it was fairly cheap compared to the other hotels - and it's location was great, which was about 6 blocks from the piers. It was a little run down and the elevators and hallways sometimes smelled a little funny, but the rooms were always clean and smelled fine. If you want a luxury hotel, this is NOT the place for you, but it was perfect for travelers who want a comfortable place to come home to at night, and a safe place to leave your things during the day.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15469475">A great bargain for Downtown Seattle. It's old, but clean and a little noisy. The location is great. Staff is friendlly. We were able to leave our car in the parking lot for hours after we checked out, which was a real nice bonus. If you just need a place to sleep for the night at a bargain price, this is it. If you want more amenities, go elsewhere. We will stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14181097">We stayed here for the price and location. The room was very outdated but we only slept there. We had the great fortune of looking out at the adult store from our window but that didn't bother us. We were only a short walk away from the shopping center and city tram which we took to the Space Needle even though we could have walked there. Once at the shopping center, we took a carriage ride which was cool. We were within walking distance to Pike Market and restaurants and bars. We would stay here again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11693449">The room price was OK for Seattle. It was the first hotel that I ever stayed that had NO pictuers hanging in the rooms or in the halls. There was a draft under the door as it was an inch off the floor &amp; was very noisy when in the room, poor water pressure &amp; the fellow at the front desk was not very courteous upon check-in..

I was concerned after I'd read reviews before going there - as it turned out, rightfully so. My room - a queen - was dingy and smelly. I couldn't identify the odor, but it may have been a combination of a former smoking room and, well, I don't know what. The place was also not designed for a business traveler. My laptop computer uses a 3-prong plug. My room had only one 3-prong outlet, nowhere convenient to where I needed to use my computer. Incredibly, the coffee maker, also with a 3-prong outlet, used a hardware store 3-to-2-prong adapter. I strongly suspect that's a violation of every fire code in the US, especially for commercial buildings. While they claim to have internet access, in my room there was no wireless, and the wired version cable was so short it did not reach to either the bed or the table. I never did figure out where one could use it. They've not figured out to put a water proof shower curtain liner inside the shower curtain - instead, they use 2 fabric shower curtains, so if one puts one on the outside and the other on the inside of the tub, after the shower, one was left with a flood in the bathroom. When I was gone during the day and the room was made up, half-filled styrofoam coffee cups and dirty water glasses were left where they were. I don't recall having every stayed in a hotel where I didn't want my feet to touch any floor surface, or my body to touch the bedspread or blanket. It was just grungy. The only upsides: location is good, and staff was very friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10343597">We had booked before checking TripAdvisor and were worried after reading some of the very negative reviews but were pleasantly surprised when we got there. All staff we met were friendly and helpful, our room was clean, so were the beds and bathroom. There were four of us in the room and there was enough space for our 3-night stay. We had sufficient coffee, tea, iron, hairdryer, towels, soaps, etc. The beds were very soft. It's so close to the major shops (Nordstrom, Macy's, Pacific Place) that one could shop, drop it all off back at the hotel and go back again for more. Good restaurants nearby. The breakfast in the hotel wasn't too bad either and again very friendly staff.

The motel is just that, a motel, right in the middle of Downtown Seattle. I think I remember it from the Seattle World's Fair in 1962! It's a bit dated and our bathroom didn't have any shelf space, but IMO, you can overlook that type of thing because of the amazing safe location. You'll think you've returned to the 60's when you drive up (easy access to I-5, which is also very important), but the location is unbeatable --- and no long waits for elevators or walks through endless lobbies). Poof and you're out the door on your way to Pike Place Market, Belltown, Downtown, monorail. Pro football and baseball venues are a 15 min bus ride south. If exploring Downtown Seattle is your goal, and you want to PLAY with your dollars instead of paying for a high rise with a view, try this motel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10002392">I don't understand many of the negative reviews here.

We are by no means stuck up people who expect 5 star hotels at a budget price. What we did expect was simple, clean accommodations. We got simple, but we didn't get clean. The room had a very strong bad smell, was dirty and the carpet all around the bathroom was wet. My kids even thought it was gross and asked if they could keep their shoes on in the room - pretty bad when boys think it's dirty. On the bright side, it was less than $10 by cab to Safeco Field.

I've been to Seattle numerous times; used to live there actually. 2. I'm not a highbrow traveler. 3. With that being said, since I did want to save a few bucks on my most recent trip to Seattle, I decided to check out the 6th Ave Inn. I've seen this place numerous times and it looked ok from the outside and was in an ok location (not the best, but not the worst). 4. My overall impression? * Yes, it is cheaper than the better hotels--&gt; for example the Westin, which is one block away, BUT, if you just hate staying at the place, what's the point? * The rooms--&gt; old. They're clean, but old... and small. * The overall hotel is, old. * The overall hotel and my "nonsmoking" room just smelled... a mixture of smoke and various bodily odors that apparently mixed into the establishment over the years. * The bed / mattress--&gt; old and soft. * The bottomline--&gt; Motel 6 is a better quality motel / rooms at a cheaper price. The problem is, there are no Motel 6s in the downtown area. It's one of the dilemmas, if you want to be in a decent location and want a nice room, you'll have to pay the extra 100.0-150.00 / night. Via this most recent trip, I realized that it's worth it to spend the extra money so that I can actually enjoy the trip... OR perhaps get one of the nice suite type rooms around Lake Union (but again--&gt; you'll be away from the downtown area).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7868734">My family and I just finished a 7-day Alaskan Cruise. We were looking for a hotel in Seattle, WA that had a shuttle service from the Pier to the Hotel, from the Hotel to the Airport, and a place to leave our luggage for 5-6 hrs as we went around site seeing in downtown. The booking company for this particular hotel assured me that all of my criteria's were met with this hotel and I booked the room (just to store our luggage) for $115. It ended up there were no travel accomodations to the hotel or to the airport. We ended up having to take 2 taxis to each of the destinations. Needless to say, I was very angry and it was an extra $80 over the hotel bill! The hotel manager was not around or ever available via phone. The customer service reps finally got back to me after I called 5-6 times and sent an email from their website. The matter was resolved, hopefully. They said they would reimburse me for the taxi fares, but I'll believe it when I see it. My advice for anyone in the same situation is to grab a taxi to the airport ($30 flat fee from anywhere downtown to the SEATAC airport), check in your luggage early, and take the ride-on bus back to downtown ($1.50 each way, .25 for seniors, free kids). It's free to ride on the bus in downtown Seattle until 7pm everyday.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7719984">We've stayed at this property a few times now.

Pillows felt filled with cotton balls, bed creaked and squeaked with the slightest movement (as did everyone else's around us too), walls and carpet were stained, did not feel the lock on the door would work. We faced a lovely strip club. The noise outside the hotel was expected due to the downtown location, but the noise from inside the hotel was obscene! People banging on our door at 3 in the morning, a party in the room above us (not to mention the 'lovemaking' we felt as if we were right in the bed with them!) Walls in general were paper thin could hear all of our neighbours conversations and whatever show they were watching on TV. Some of the staff was very friendly, others not the sharpest...

I know what I can get for the money and I have stayed in some pretty basic places before. But the stay at this hotel was so unsatifactory that we left early. We got to the hotel before check-in time. So we explained who we were and left our bags. When we arrived in the evening, there were hardly any rooms left and the 2-bed room that we reserved was gone (I don't know how this was possible since we pre-checked in before anyone else even got there). The front desk service was completely unbending in their uncourteous and non-helpful nature. THE ROOM: I was pregnant and my husband and I had to share one bed with our toddler. The brass bed was so unstable that we were rolling off the edges and it creaked, rattled and shook all night long. No roll-away was provided and my husband ended up having to sit in a small wooden chair for part of the night to sleep in. I got a total of 3 hours sleep because of it. The bathroom had disgusting unsanitary remains of the last people to stay there (smears along the sink and tile). The toilet was shotty. The carpet was scary to have a young child walk, sit or play on. WE got up early that morning and checked out 2 days early. Luckily the manager allowed us to get a refunded amount for the two nights we would not be there but was in no way wanting to make up for the night that we did stay there. We went out of the city center to stay in tukwila and had a great time the rest of the trip.

We wanted a decent hotel in a great location downtown. We found it in The Sixth Avenue Inn! The building is older, but we enjoyed our small room with newly remodeled bathroom. The bathroom fan didn't work when we arrived, but we voiced our request to have it fixed and it was within the day while we were out sightseeing. Housekeeping was wonderful--very helpful, quiet, and willing to go the extra mile. The front desk staff was also great to chat with and help direct us toward what we wanted to see/do. The streets are busy with trucks and buses, which did highlight the single paned windows, but it's just that....a busy downtown area! We loved the location to the many shops and places to eat. There is such a variety of both within blocks so we were very pleased. The restaurant within was charming. Most of the wait staff were pleasant and prompt. The value and quantity of food for the cost is within reason--breakfasts were huge! We would stay here again---we booked this hotel on Hotwire and received a rate much lower than usual.

My complaints the next day were waved off until I insisted on a maintenance person coming up to inspect the staining and bubbling of paint in my bathroom. Bedding was poor -- the sheets on my queen-sized bed were for a twin? In any case, the sheets could not be tucked in top and bottom.

It was a nice, central location for the price we paid. We got a slightly better rate via Expedia than was available booking direct via their web site. We had a room with one queen bed on the 4th floor, on the side of the hotel not facing the adult bookstore. It looked like perhaps those on that side were all doubles? The neighborhood seemed safe, and was within easy walking distance to many restaurants, shops, etc. Hotel furnishings were not new by any means, definitely showing signs of wear, but no real complaints in that department. We could hear a bit of street and hall noise at times, but never enough to keep us awake at night. It was always much quieter when we had the curtains closed. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful, both at the desk and in the restaurant. Restaurant menu was limited overall, but had a good selection of reasonably priced items for breakfast. The room service menu (which we never utilitized) featured a handful of the same restaurant items at an average of $2 additional per item. Our room was clean, and housekeeping staff did a good job throughout the week. They give you the option of new sheets/towels each day.

My son and I stayed for two nights and had no problems at all. On the plus side, we were allowed to check in early into our rooms (at 11:30 a.m.) for no extra charge. That made a big difference. I enjoyed doing a load of laundry after camping for eight straight nights. The washer and dryer were clean and in good working condition. The staff was extremely polite and friendly. They reserved a Town Car for us the morning we left and it was only $30.00 to get to the airport. The driver was there early and it was much nicer than taking a cab. The hotel is conveniently located. We walked to the Space Needle, Pike's Market and Pioneer Square. Our room was 330 square feet, so I was puzzled about some of the complaints about the rooms being small. Our room was only $129.00 in the heart of the summer, which I didn't think was too bad. On the negative side, we did have a view of an adult entertainment store. The rooms are a little worn and shabby--not dirty but not at all elegant. But when I realized that we would be out of the room almost all day and that the Westin was almost twice what we were paying, we decided to spend our extra money on the dining room at the Edgewater Inn on the waterfront. We ate outside and had a fabulous view of the Sound. Anyway, I felt the room was of reasonable quality for the money and the staff was a lot friendlier than at the more expensive hotel we stayed at in San Francisco!

The parking is not free. There is a $10 dollar charge per night if you want to park in their lot. Another comment relating to other reviews given here: if you can get this place for as low as $66 or $80 a night it is well worth it. We ended up paying $180 since it was short notice stay on a weekend and didn't have an easy time finding a hotel with vacancy. The hotel itself is nice for a low to mid range hotel. The staff is helpful and courteous. They even accomidated a middle of the night request for silverware brought to our room. The rooms were quite clean and the furnishings were in good condition and of moderate quality. They have a fitness room, offered to guests free of charge, which i took advantage of. This room had 3 different machines (bike, eliptical, and treadmill). I'm not much for bikes but tried the elliptical and the treadmill. the elliptical didn't seem to work quite right but the treadmill was adequate. All the equipment seemed a bit dated, likely from the 90's. The treadmill was in good solid working condition although I can't state the condition of the other two. I'm not sure if the fact that I am in great need for a new matress in my own bed at home or if the bed i slept in at this hotel were as exceptional as it seemed. I slept like a baby though. This is saying something too because the walls in this hotel were thin and the windows were alluminum. You could hear police sirens at all hours of the day and night. This didn't bother me so much but if you are looking for a bit more luxury try another hotel. The food at the restraunt was delicious. We ate in the lounge and the ambience and atmosphere was very cozy. Really if it weren't for the high cost of the room i would be completely satisfied.

They even have a Bar&amp;Grill located in the hotel that had pretty decent food and not to mention our waiter was very funny. The only cons I had was the road noise, which was bearable and the squeaking floors from the room above us other than that everything was fine. I would say this has one of the best locations for a budget hotel, there is a McDonalds at the corner and a Starbucks near by. Everything is withing walking distance but you can catch the free bus zone stop at the corner which can take you 3 stops closer to the middle of downtown and in to the heart of all the shopping. The Seattle Center is about 8-10 blocks away on foot, which took us 15 minutes for us to walk. Everything is walkable but just have your walking shoes ready. If you do decided to ride the Grayline Downtown Aiporter Bus, the stop is at the Westin, which is a block away.

The rooms are basic but clean, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are clean with hot water but very small showers, and the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, but do not go "above and beyond." Essentially, this is a two star hotel, fair and square. Bring earplugs, as the walls are paper thin, and there is constant noise either from the street or from other rooms. Even just the people in the room above you moving around is enough to keep you awake at night, since it creates a loud creaking and thumping sound with every step they take. The area is so-so. It is within walking distance to main areas and attractions, and cab rides are short and cheap from this central location, but I wouldn't want to be walking in the immediate area surrounding the hotel. The best feature of this hotel is the restaurant. The staff is amazingly friendly, attentive and FAST! Service is top notch. The food is also great for what it is. Don't expect gourmet cusine, by why would you at a hotel of this callibre. It's homestyle American food, and it is good, with oversized portions (perfect for sharing!).

Then we were surprised at how stained the carpet was. The furniture was all chipped and worn, the walls definitely needed painted. When we entered the little bathroom the paint peeling from the ceiling was quite obvious. I sprayed perfume in the room so we could stand to stay there. The one bed was apparent that most people slept on the left side, you rolled that way. I did bring it to the attention of the front desk and he said we could move the next day. The next morning while my husband was showering, he came out very unhappy. The obvious peeling paint was from the tub above our room, as it drained cold water on his head. We were then transfered to another room that wasn't much cleaner. When you opened the bathroom door it only opened half way as it got caught on the floor. Big tripping hazard. Will never stay there again. Spend a little more on another place, it will be well worth it. This place is WAY over priced and very unkept. Erga in the lounge was great though.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4102703">Twice I have stayed here as a cheap alternative to the Westin, where I was at a conference. For $100 less per night, you get a perfectly adequate room. They may have done some work in the two years since I was last there. I found the room fine, though it and the bath were a bit small. Iron, coffee maker, hair dryer, lights and TV fine. The food is OK but the restaurant a bit on the dark side. I really liked my little room, except the windows are single pane and daytime traffic noise is a bit loud (get a room on the upper floor, or at the back). This is a budget hotel, but it is not a dive. Definitely a step up from Motel 6 style places. Lots of food in the places - just blocks from Westlake Center. Bed and linens were just fine. I have always found the staff to be pleasant. I'll stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4033975">Free parking, friendly staff, nice, basic, clean room, just what we needed.

Pike's Market, shopping, and dining are easily within walking distance and the bus and light rail easily accessible within a couple of blocks. Great location. The rooms are large and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is small but there is a nice walk in shower and make up mirror with good lighting. The suites have a cushy sofa that pulls out to a comfortable bed. The lobby is warm and welcoming. I appreciated the fireplace coming in from the cold weather. Our check in was delayed due to linen arriving late which was disappointing after a long flight. We were finally given keys to a room that other guests were clearly occupying. The staff was quick to get us to another room and get us settled in.

Re-visiting this weekend was a bit disappointing. The room was nice - roomy, sofa to relax in, wet bar with coffee maker, small bath with walk-in shower, good closet/dressing space, comfortable bed, reasonably quiet. But everything is just a little frayed around the edges, I'd say. The sink in the wet bar only worked for hot water - no cold. The common areas are worn, carpet dirty, etc. People are friendly. In-house restaurant expensive. ($11 for a small bowl of granola? seriously?) No valet to take our car at 10 p.m. on Sunday when we returned from dinner.

We had a great experience at the hotel and in Seattle! We stayed 3 nights in a Luxe Suite and feel like, compared to "normal" prices for a downtown hotel room, we got a good deal at $169 per night. Andra is close to EVERYTHING downtown. It's an easy 4 block walk to Pike Place Market, 2 blocks to Westlake Center for shopping, and there are outstanding restaurants all over the place. You can also take the monorail from Westlake for a 5 minute trip to the Space Needle and the EMP. The Sea-Tac train is across the street from Westlake as well so you can take it from the airport and back if you don't mind taking your luggage two blocks. We had carry-ons so it wasn't a big deal. You don't need a car here! Everything is close! :) We were met by the front desk employees for check-in and it went very smoothly. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area and the city. They also did things little things for you like hit the "down" button on the elevator for you as you walked down the hall if they happened to be standing close by. The lobby is great for sitting and visiting with friends or colleagues with nice furniture and a fireplace. There is easy access off the lobby to the bar area as well. The place is decorated beautifully with contemporary furnishings. The room was a typical two-room suite with a living area and separate bedroom with a french door entry. There was a couple of flat screen TVs and a desk for work if you need it. My wife liked the sitting area for putting on make-up, and that was needed considering the bathroom was a little on the small side. This is normal for older hotels that have been remodeled and it wasn't an issue. The entire room was roomy, and comfortable. There was ZERO wear and tear on this place. The upkeep seems to be really good and they take great care in making the place very clean. It's even nicer than it looks in the photos. My wife commented that it "looks better than the web site". The turn down service was great too as they put on nice music and leave delicious dark chocolates. Restaurants: Eat at Lola in the lobby! Great eggs benedict! Across the street is Dahlia Lounge which was good. Serious Pie (pizza) is across the street on Virginia Street and is SERIOUSLY good. We had it twice! Ralph's Grocery is at the end of the block on 4th Street take a right out of the lobby and it's on the corner. They have a really good wine selection, groceries, food, etc. I was actually really surprised how nice it was inside. Of course, go the the market on the water, and don't miss Etta's for AMAZING crab benedict and Cafe Campagne for some of the best French food I've ever had!

The hotel admits that it has a security video of a professional thief stealing my bag off its bellhopâ€™s luggage cart, but it will not compensate me. The wonderful consumer advocate Chris Elliott investigated and confirmed my version of the incident, and you can read his blog about it at his website, [--] for all the details. Now I am just getting the word out to everyone else. So the short version of events is that back in August, the bellhop unloaded my things from the rental car onto a cart, whisked it away, and as it turns out, parked it in the lobby. When the luggage came to the room later, my backpack (including eyeglasses and medicine) was missing. Only after I yelled at the people at the front desk did the hotel review its security tapes and sure enough, a week after we left, it confirmed that a man is seen on the tape stealing my bag. The hotel said he looked like a professional, but the hotel never even bothered to call the police. Meanwhile, the hotelâ€™s insurance company denied coverage because the bellhop was so stupid as to leave the bag unattended in the lobby, a public space. The only correct response from the hotel should have been, â€œWe are so sorry. How can we fix this?â€� Nope. Instead, a month after the incident, I was told that the clerk behind the counter says she offered to move my luggage to a more secure location. That is total nonsense. Why would I possibly refuse such an offer if it ever had been made? The same clerk also said she tried to call my husband on his cell while he was returning the rental car. Of course, there is no cell record of this because she never actually did that. So the director of rooms refunded the first night of our hotel stay when we checked out because the hotel had given me the runaround and treated me so poorly while I was there. The manager later refunded our second night, while specifically denying the hotel was responsible. How could it not be?! And the refund covers only half the value of the bag. Really, really awful hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120921020">The location was extremely convenient to downtown Seattle with the Washington State Convention Center and Pike Place market both a brief stroll from Hotel Andra.

We booked the Northern Neighbours Package that included free internet and 50% off parking and a complimentary room grade upon arrival. Before leaving home I decided I wanted to guarantee the suite, so I emailed the hotel and asked to be moved into a Suite, the told me there were not any available. So I checked Hotels.ca and there were suites showing as available. I phoned the Hotel and was told that there were suites, so upgrade my reservation. Then later that same day I received and email saying there had been cancellations so a suite was available (this email from the person that had earlier said there were no suites until I asked via email why Hotels.ca was showing them). So all that was a bit confusing for me. In the end we got the suite as a complimentary upgrade for the misunderstanding and miscommunication. First, I love small boutique hotels, I am not a fan of mega hotels. I loved the lobby and the design. I loved the furnishings in the rooms, a mix of contemporary decor within a historic building. One issue though was the lighting in the room was horrible. I could not see in the closet, I could not see in the dresser and had to feel around for my clothes, even with the lights all turned on and the drapes open. The bathroom was surprisingly small considering the size of the rest of the suite. We had also asked for housekeeping to put the pull our sofa away during the day and make it up again at night for our daughter. This never happened as requested. We also arrived back one afternoon at 4:00 to find the room still had not been cleaned for the day. This was quite disappointing. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and treated my daughter with respect and kindness. The location was great for walking pretty much everywhere. The TV in the elevator - they have to go.... I don't watch TV and I don't allow my daughter to watch TV so I am very disturbed when I see TVs in public spaces where I have no control over what she sees. And even if I was not traveling with her , I don't want to be bombarded by marketing and the negativity on the news in every public space I visit. The desk space in the suite was great for working however the internet was quite sloe..So all in all some mixed feelings about the hotel.

Downsides were many. the bed was so bad, there was a huge dip in the middle where literally, you had to either hover on the edge of the bed or roll into the big hole in the middle. My husband and I had the worst sleep ever. We complained, no change, no reply. Ditto about the shower. It did not drain. About three minutes into your shower and you are standing in ankle deep water. That to me, is disgusting. We asked three times for a plumber to fix it. No luck. It remained that way for our entire stay. Room service only has Greek food on the menu. It was from Lola's. It tasted pretty good, but way too limited in variety. Overall, it wasn't the worst place ever, but we expect good service and response, and a comfortable bed and nice bathroom are important to us, plus we order a fair amount of room service. So, overall there were just too many negatives and with many other great choices in Seattle, this one just isn't worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118626512">We arrived earlier than expected (11 am) and were going to leave the car and check in at the regular time (3 pm), but the staff checked and our room was ready ahead of schedule - perfect!

I think that while it is not a 3-star hotel, it is also not quite a 4-hotel. I would say that this hotel lies in the "3.5-star" range. First of all, I think that the boutique concept has been lost. The hotel room is no more comfortable or contain more finesse than other similar priced hotels in cities. In fact, there are a few things about the room (minibar quality, bed frame, coffee table, shower) that are sub-par. I think that a Boutique hotel should also provide warm service and a personal touch. While the service was in no way bad, the staff at Hotel Andra did not fulfill that criterion. In addition, I was confused as to how this hotel can be good for business travelers without free-WIFI, complimentary in-room broadband, and complimentary use of computers and printers. Overall a nice hotel to stay in with a great restaurant below, but may be slightly over-hyped.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116771655">We met some friends in Seattle to watch some baseball for the week-end.

The rooms are spacious, compared to NYC. The toiletries are FACE stockholm and the towels are Frette. However, the service could use some extra training. It first started with the reception. She asked if I would like a map of Seattle. And she asked if I would like a key to the mini-bar. And she knew I was a guest of a wedding party. So, why did I end up going to my room without my map, key or the wedding info packet that everyone was supposed to receive? AND without my credit card!! I was preoccupied with getting my sister checked in that I didn't bother to follow up with the receptionist. And then when I asked her for the wedding packet, she picked up a stack of stuff on the front desk, looked underneath and then disappeared into the back room and then came back, picked up the stack again and found the pack. Our next interesting interaction involved the valet. We were coming home from the wedding friday late evening and decided to tidy up the car a bit before we went up to our room. When we all emerged from the car, I asked the valet, who was at his stand, if i should leave the key in the car, he said, "i wouldn't if i were you." without even looking up at me. Well, "where should i put it?' he requested that i bring the key to him. really? are you chained to your stand? unbelievable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116607553">We stayed at the Hotel Andra the night before starting a cruise.

Despite the aesthetics, our upgrade and checkout staff were incredible rude which was unfortunate given our stay was for Valentines. For example, after getting a cold checkout my partner and I waiting outside for a valet to get our car key which was already parked up front. After five minutes of waiting in the cold, I returned to the desk and asked the clerk to call the valet - attitude, no apology for inconvenience and to add further insult to injury she hadn't called herself despite seeing us waiting. The valet was equally rude and handed me my keys with a "here" - no thank you, no do you need directions, no look forward to seeing you again.

Modern furnishings in clean rooms are a plus. Andra promotes "free valet parking" when booking best available rate thru internet or direct with hotel. Upon check-in I was advised that parking would be +$39.00 since I booked "early rate" rather than best available. I thought the early booking rate was the best available. Apparently not so. Best available rate is actually $41.00 more than early booking. Sounds like the old doublespeak "up 10%, down 10%" flim-flam sales promo. I was totally confused and told check-in agent that this web site is misleading. The desk agent did the right thing however and agreed not to charge us the $39. We would not have taken our car if this was relatively clear. Hopefully Andra will "correct" this so others do not fall into the dilemna we had.

We travel relatively frequently and Seattle always makes for a great romantic get-away weekend, which typically includes shopping, dining and clubbing. We've stayed in a variety of hotels in Seattle (often selected by Hotwire or Priceline because you can get some great deals using both) and while most of them have been "nice," none of them have ever just blown us out. As I wanted this weekend to be extra-special, I decided to do research and book directly thru the hotel. My final selection was a suite the Hotel Andra. Wow! What a fantastic find. From the staff, to the decor, to the room size, it was perfection in every way. It was a front corner suite with loads of light and great views of the active neighborhood. We were not bothered by street noise, as a number of people had reported. About the only bad thing I could find was an area of common complaint in other reviews: The bathroom is small and poorly lit. We brought a floor lamp in from the living room for extra light. This is not saying that it wasn't stylish - it was quite stylish. it was also small and dark. There's not much they can do about the size (old building) but some additional light would be nice. The service was exceptional and anything we wanted or needed was taken care of perfectly. When Lola, one of two restaurants in the hotel, was packed, we called downstairs and had a table waiting in short order. Lola was the other great find of the weekend, by the way. What a great restaurant. We had both dinner and breakfast there and both were REALLY good. Back to the hotel. We arrived at 4pm intending to relax, go out to dinner and then head out to some clubs for the night. We didn't leave the hotel until 2pm the following afternoon. Between the fantastic suite, the great bar and two top restaurants, there was no reason to leave the building!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR94202258">A hip hotel, ideally situated, with good energy and containing a great restaurant, Lola.

Our room was not ready till after 6pm, then when we got settled into our room my 4 year old son found drug paraphanalia on the floor in front of the couch. When my partner went down to talk to the manager, they didn't really act like it was a big deal. My partner works for the department of justice and really tried to press the severity of a little kid coming accross drugs in our room. So after dinner we go back up to our room to set the kids up with a movie in the living room, and the TV doesn't work, so we all end up in the main bedroom with the kids watching a movie. Instead of having the tiny amount of space we were supposed to have. The next day they offered a free movie rental, which really doesn't make up for a ruined night.

My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary in Seattle and of course wanted it to be as special as possible. From reservation to check-out, we have nothing but great feedback. Upon arrival, we were greeted outside as we arrived by taxi by the door person who graciously loaded our luggage onto a bell cart and assured us our luggage will be sent to our room once we check in - and it was. The front desk agents were attentive to our needs and answered our questions as we thought of them and check in was flawless - we stayed in a corner Lux suite on the 10th floor. Upon entering our room, I have a habit of checking the entire room to make sure it is cleaned and everything works. I have to say, I was extremely impressed by the overall cleanliness and attention to detail, so kudos to the guest room attendants who keep this room clean. Not an ounce of dust to be found, amenities set up to perfection. Furthermore, as we ventured out into the city each day, our room was 'reset' just as though we were arriving for the first time and let's not forget about the daily turndown service! Throughout our stay as we entered and exited the hotel, the staff always smiled at us and genuinely looked like they wanted to be there and that speaks volumes.

The rooms are freshly redone in a stylish contemporary vein. We stayed in a jr. suite, which was very roomy and separated the bedroom from the living room by louvered doors (very handy when one partner wants to sleep and the other wants to read). The restaurant Lola occupies the corner and adjoins the lobby. The food is excellent and they were still serving dinner when we checked in at 11:30 PM on a Monday night (they provide the 24 hr. room service, which was also excellent). The location is great, just a couple of blocks up the hill from Pike's Market and other downtown attractions. Other Tom Douglas restaurants (Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery, Serious Pie) are right across the street. The staff was super friendly and efficient.

It was our first time in Seattle and we picked this hotel based on its location and the reviews that we had read. First off, the rooms are a lot smaller than what we are used to, but it's clean and comfortably decorated. Second of all, they keep charging us for things that we did not consume! We got a charge for a bottle of water that we did not drink. I already found it strange when we went back to the hotel after housekeeping came in the second day, we found an extra bottle of water by our night stand. We didn't think much of it since the seal is still intact, so we just left it where we found it. When we checked out the next morning, there was a charge of almost $4 for that bottle of water. After I explained it to them, they did take it off. As I was going through my credit card statement after we got home, I noticed there was another charge of $5.48 from the hotel. I called and asked and was told that was for a bag of m&amp;ms and a snickers bar, which again we did not have!!!!!!

And they lost my breakfast room service reservation that I stuck to my door the night before, which was very inconvenient as I was in a rush. Even considering that, of my three-night stay, I would much prefer to stay there than anywhere else in Seattle.

We went to a concert at the Moore Theater so the hotel location was very convenient for walking back and forth and close to restaurant options. I had two dissatisfactions after our stay there - one was that there was some very slight damage to the bumper of our car after we used the valet service. The bumper looked like it had been pulled away from the car and one of the clips was broken. I noticed it as soon as we got to our destination after check out and called about 20 minutes after picking up the car. The response from the hotel was ok, but after the "investigation" we were basically penalized for waiting until the next morning to bring it by to have the hotel look at it and not immediately after calling. Who wants to drive all the way back downtown when given the choice of coming in the next morning when it's more convenient? If that was going to be an issue when investigating what happened to the car, then say we needed to come right back to have them look at it. After looking into it the manager felt they weren't responsible and it really wasn't a huge issue - more annoying that anything. The other annoyance is that they overcharged us after the fact and said we ate some of the food in the room. It wasn't a huge charge, but after the car thing and having to call twice to have it credited back it would make me think twice about staying there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR66676150">An amazing hotel....Booked it through the websites -- 2 hours after booking, I got to the hotel, they had my room ready, and had a great stay.

I found the numerous items for sale in the room tiresome, not least the bottled oxygen on the bathroom shelf with a toothpaste stained card announcing I'd be charged if the wrapping was damaged. The sink and toilet are very low, and the bath tub is old and needs refinishing. The outlet drain is placed too low to allow a deep soak.

The small disappointment was when we checked out. First of all the wake up call came 15 minutes too late. Futhermore we were recommended to take a town car to the airport which would only be a few dollars more than a normal taxi and much more comfortable.

Our room was quiet even though there seemed to be a party going on down the hall in one of the other suites, glad we weren't next door to them. The decor is starting to look a little tired, almost like they used cheap materials which are now showing their age. The bathroom is the smallest I have ever come across, I could stand in the middle and touch all four walls.

They offered to let us use the business office to check -in and print boarding passes. The Valet even got a scale so we could weigh our luggage. The hotel also offers to setup "town car rides" at $ 45 per car ( we had 4 passengers) from the airport to the Andra, and $25 per car from the Andra to the cruise ships.

The hotel looks like a great European Boutique hotel, which we liked. The area seems to be quiet and sweetâ€¦just watch which way you walk. There are many vagrants wandering the streets as you get closer to Pike Place Market. The hotel itself is nice. The staff could just use a bit of a pep talk. When we checked in, the front desk attendant tried to change the price of one of the 2 nights of our original reservation. Then when my husband asked for an itemized receipt to verify upon checkout, another clerk seemed as if he couldnâ€™t be bothered. The room was comfortable, two cozy Queen beds, a sofa and table, desk, large marble-top bar area, and a huge walk in closet that was great for storing luggage. The bathroom was a little small. My biggest complaint about the room is the lighting. All light in the room comes from small lamps except for the light over the bar. The hotel is romantic, but not the best for familyâ€¦also there is no pool. Internet access is not free, and there was no water in the fitness center just FYI.

From a local perspective, it's a great way to take in the character of the city. Location - Andra is conveniently located close to the heart of downtown shopping, and not too far to walk to the Pike Place Market and art museum. There is construction as others have noted, but it's not loud. The best part is being literally within striking distance of some of the city's best restaurants - especially those owned by celeb chef Tom Douglas. Dine at Lola, Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery (casual cafe), or Serious Pie if you're looking for great food. I recommend Lola for dinner - great Mediterranean/Morrocan fare (adjoins the lobby), and Dahlia Lounge for brunch. Room/Decor - Very tastefully decorated and modern. Our bathroom in the standard room was small (particularly the shower/tub), but the main living area was very spacious and the bed quite comfortable. There is a little vanity/seating area for getting ready, nice bathrobes and decent bath products. General Hotel/Service - Everything was very clean, the lobby and lounge very attractive.

I loved the hotel when I first started staying there, but it was looking a little rough around the edges on the last stay there so I moved down the street to another hotel on my most recent trip. The carpets could do with replacing, for example. The beds are comfortable, although don't go to the bathroom in the dark if you don't want bruised shins/stubbed toes from the unnessecarily sharp and protruding bed bases. If you want a room with less constuction noise, request one that looks onto 4th Avenue and not Virginia Street. Wifi charge is extra, which in this day and age, is more than a bit cheeky. Trot down to Top Pot on 5th Avenue for choice donuts and free Wifi. Regret to say that some of the front desk staff have always come across as somewhat snooty and arrogant, particulaly one young lady with reddish, straight hair. A polite change request for items in the room due to an allergy is always met with borderline contempt. Crack a smile, lady! Room service from Lola is good, but extremely expensive with the hotel charges. Better to grab it at the bar or take a table. Breakfast and Lunch at Lola is superb, dinner less so. Very nice, knowledgable and efficient wait staff, but I suspect front of house went to the same School of Snoot as Andra front desk. Excellent wine and drinks list, with a very nice happy hour. I might stay there again once the construction is complete, and hope the hotel staff seem a little happier to be there next time, so would still recommend it. There are nicer hotels in Seattle, I have found, so shop around.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR35920285">My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Andra for six nights to celebrate our 5 year anniversary and enjoy the sites in downtown Seattle. We absolutely loved the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. There was so much to do, so many great places to eat and so much within walking distance. We walked to a Mariners baseball game, to Pike's Place, to the waterfront to catch a ferry to Bainbridge Island and even stopped by the funky public library. Our Queen suite was huge and clean. The bed was ridiculously comfortable. The bathroom was huge and had great shelving space and an oustanding two headed shower. The extra space in the room allowed us to enjoy breakfast in our room most mornings. The walk in closet was outstanding and provided great storage. We never heard any other guests and were always treated kindly by the helpful staff. There was construction going on in the building next door that started early in the morning. But, we are from a big city and are used to outside noise - so that wasn't too much of a problem. Overall - what an amazingly convenient, luxurious, and comfortable hotel!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR26834384">This was the last hotel we stayed in on our multi-state honeymoon. We splurged and wish we'd chosen somewhere else. The bed was really, really, really comfortable, and the bathroom design and decor was nice, but those are about the only good things to say about it. Usually I'm reasonably happy with hotels, but this was such a disappointment. When you pay $180/night for a room, it should be worth it. What Went Wrong: --Reservations staff noticed we were on honeymoon and offered, pre-trip, complimentary champagne; the front desk staff forgot until two hours after we'd been in our room. --We arrived precisely at check-in time with luggage, and they wouldn't change our designated room (same price!) so we had to leave our luggage at the desk. When we returned an hour later, they hadn't delivered our luggage to our room, as promised. --Other reviewers mentioned it, but I was shocked anyway: The volume of ridiculous stuff in your room that is only accessible through paying for it. It seemed really tacky to have $50 oxygen therapy something (canisters?) - why are they shilling for that product? --I'm used to small spaces, but really. The room was ridiculously small. --Furniture was in poor condition.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26303543">Excellent location, tasteful, nice sized room in a hip hotel with a swell restaurant. I had business in town, so my husband and I stayed over the weekend and enjoyed Seattle. We were able to walk just about everywhere in town from the hotel. Lola Restaurant downstairs was eclectic, fun and delicious! Bar scene off of lobby seemed very happening. Dahlia Lounge, Dahlia Bakery and Serious Pies are right across the street. Best coconut cream pies and donuts ever. Our only complaint was the size of the bathroom, too small for two people, so getting ready in the morning took a little longer. The closet was huge though and the flat screen TV was nice. The bed was crazy comfortable. Watch out for the bottled air in the bathroom, you will be charged about $60 if the wrapper is removed! Not a place for little ones.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24534929">We had stayed at the Andra before and really enjoyed the location, the rooms--the whole experience! This time unfortunately the room next to us and the one across the hall were occupied by people who were partying all night. After being asked twice by management to be quiet, they still continued. They should have removed the people from their room rather that allowing them to disturb the sleep of everyone on the floor. We were given credit for the parking charge--big deal! I know it was just the luck of the draw but we won't stay there again.

Mainly, I wanted larger rooms, and that's what I got. I got the King Suite and it was very roomy and spacious for the price. The room was very well appointed, very modern, but not cold like the W. I compare this hotel to the W because I often stay at W's when I travel because I like the service and quality of their rooms. Andra is a very well appointed and designed hotel. I like the stylistic touches you'll see throughout the property. In a lot of ways, it was much better than any W I've been too, especially for the price. The service was really great. I saw lots of hustle with the bell captains, and desk staff. NYE is a very busy night, and there was no lack of attention anywhere. The best part of the hotel is that it's in the middle of Tom Douglas' restaurant Disneyland. Lola's is in the hotel, Dahlia Lounge is across the street, and Serious Pie is a block up. My dinner at Lola's and Dahlia lounge was extraordinary, and the quality of the meal and attention to detail to food rivals restaurants that cost ten times more in L.A. and NY. Lola's is also the "kitchen" for the hotel. GET BREAKFAST IN BED IN THE MORNING. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. GET THE BREAKFAST WITH THE HOME MADE SAUSAGES AND CRAVE THEM...FOREVER! ...also, there's a Martini at the Dahlia Lounge made with a local gin from DRY FLY in which, if the craving doesn't subside, I will have to fly up to Seattle just to savor it's taste again. I'm thinking if you just stay here at the hotel, hit all the Tom Douglas' restaurants, you're in for a very chic and satisfying getaway.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22062459">The title of my review basically sums up our recent stay at the Andra. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay, as we got a deep discount, but I'm left wondering how or why they are listed with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. We had a Lux King corner suite, and the suite itself is quite spacious, and very quiet, we did have a restful sleep. Beds/linens were soft and comfortable, and they brought up extra pillows as requested. There was plenty of storage in our suite -- 2 closets and a set of drawers, plus the generously-sized night tables were a plus. However, the sofa was disappointing -- of cheap construction, and sagging in the middle; fairly uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv. The armchair seriously needed recovering, as the edges were worn, dirty and frayed. The suite is due for an overhaul soon; we noticed chipped paint throughout, plus chipped and scratched furniture. The carpets felt a bit grimy -- there was an overall feeling that the room could have been cleaner. The bathroom is small (I knew this going in, having read past reviews). This did not bother me much, as there were adequate shelves and storage. However, if you like soaking in the tub, forget it. The tub has a very low overflow drain, obviously designed by someone who hates baths. I'm 5'2" and not very big -- the maximum water level came up to my lower abdomen. As I reclined trying to soak, the water kept draining off, and I gave up after about 5 minutes. Shower pressure is good and tons of hot water any time of the day. The Face Stockholm amenities are a delicious subtle white tea fragrance; however the bottles are the size of postage stamps, which seems cheap for a "luxury" hotel. The staff are happy to send up more, but it was tiring to request this on a daily basis. The staff were mostly 20-30 somethings and very pleasant and eager to please. However, I still feel they have not achieved a "luxury" level of service. We had a simple request that we be sent a Seattle Times, v. a New York times as we like to read local news. On a daily basis we received a New York times, which to give them credit, was swiftly replaced with a Seattle Times on request, but we shouldn't have had to keep asking for 4 days in a row. Another time we asked a desk person to reconfirm a reservation (the concierge had left) and he looked at us like we handed him a dead fish. It may seem that I'm nitpicking, but I would expect this from maybe a Motel 6 v. a "luxury" hotel. I would actually place the Andra slightly above a 3 star hotel, not at a "luxury" level. The staff for the most part, are accomodating and pleasant, and the room was ok. We would stay again if we got the same low rate; however, we would not stay if we had to pay the high season rate of approx $480.00 -- we felt the service and room would not be worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21981805">Stayed here for a friend's wedding. I had high expectations going into this hotel, and I was not impressed at all after I checked in. The rooms were very small and cramped. The bathrooms seemed small too. I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle the previous two nights and paid about the same price...and was far more impressed with the accommodations at the Sheraton....they had better accommodations, bigger rooms, bigger bathrooms, and everything seemed cleaner &amp; more upscale. During checkout I checked my bags with the hotel so I could get lunch. When I came back for my bags, nobody was able to find them. I ended up having to ask a bellboy to take me down into the basement myself so I could see if my bags were there or not.....I ended up finding them locked in some random room in the basement. So staff seemed pretty worthless that I had to find my bags that they lost themselves.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR21720053">My work responsibilities have taken me to Seattle 4-6 times a year over the last five years and I now have stayed at Hotel Andra about two dozen times, 2-5 nights each stay. In that time period, I have had to travel extensively elsewhere (domestically and internationally) as well but this is my favorite hotel. Apart from a superb location at the seam of downtown Seattle and Bell Town with all its wonderful restaurants -- a location which cannot be beat in my view -- this non-convention style hotel is very contemporary in its furnishings, has comfortable beds and efficient workspaces (with easy internet access), and has two excellent restaurants on either side (one accessible through its lobby). The breakfasts at Lola are just outstanding; on the other side, Assaggio is a terrific Italian place for dinner (and across the street one can have an excellent lunch or dinner at Dahlia Lounge). Most of all, the staff is particularly friendly and responsive, happy to accommodate reasonable requests for favors. And, as if that were not enough, as a news junkie I really value the fact that one only has to ask and, presto, you have a free copy of the New York Times (including Sunday's!) at your door each morning!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR21548448">I have had the priveledge of staying at the Hotel Andra in Seattle twice this year.

Initially I was put in a room on the Virginia Street side where there is a huge apartment building going up. The first night I was woken up at 6:45 AM due to extremely loud construction drilling, banging, trucks driving, &amp; men at work. I asked to have my room changed immediately &amp; the staff was accommodating. I was moved to the 4th Avenue side of the hotel &amp; able to sleep undisturbed. The hotel location is great. The rooms were fine, but I would say that the lights were very dim. Brighter lighting would be helpful. I second some of the comments here about the mildew in bathrooms &amp; small size of the bathrooms. However, the closets were quite large. The hotel gym was quite small &amp; had only 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical machine &amp; 1 stairmaster. The business center was also small-with only 2 computers, but free internet access &amp; printing. The lobby is nice with the fireplace &amp; Scandinavian decor.

I got a good deal on hotels.com for a package that included a $40 per night coupon at one of the Tom Douglas restaurants and parking. The other reviews generally capture the pluses and minuses of the hotel. Pluses -- rooms are nicely designed, and the location is excellent. I wouldn't describe the decor as ultra-hip, but modern and comfortable. The minuses -- the bathroom is small and not luxurious at all (basically a minimally remodeled older style bath from the 1930s or 40s); the internet access is not good (I had assumed it was free since it didn't say there was a charge on the internet, and there is a $10 charge, which I find annoying); and the service was on the poor side. This isn't a rant, but we checked in at 3 pm, our room was not ready, the front desk said we couldn't leave the bags in the room, and no effort to try to compensate us in some way -- not a really big deal, just tiresome and not the kind of thing that makes you feel like the service was great.

Before my review I want to mention that all the public busses are free in downtown Seattle all the time just hop on, no charge!! We are kinda fussy travelers. We would not hesitate to recomend this hotel. Rooms are beautiful, roomy sort of a mini suite. Everything seems brand new. Robes are to die for. The bathroom maybe small but....they are clean and nothing to even mention as a negative,and there is sort of a dressing area outside the bathroom by the walk in closet. The immediate area has several nice resturants, also a pizza place (Serious Pie) and a bakery accross the street.

I have never checked out of a hotel early in my many years of travel. I booked a room at the Hotel Andra almost 6 months before we went to Seattle. I booked directly through their website for a room described as "2 Queens or 1 King". I made a note in the reservation that I wanted the 1 King, as I was going with my boyfriend. When I got my confirmation via email, it said "2 Queens" but the note was on there about the 1 King, so I didn't worry about it. When we arrived, I verified with the front desk agent that we were indeed getting 1 King, not 2 Queens. He said only the 2 Queens room was available. Obviously, we did not want to spend our vacation time sleeping in separate beds. The only thing available with 1 bed was a Queen. In other words, we were downgraded. There was no offer made to lower our rate, though. I blew it off at first because we had received a great rate anyway. After we spent one night in the room, we were both miserable and grumpy with each other. The queen bed was just way too tiny after being used to a King at home, and the room itself was also incredibly small. The bathroom was hardly big enough to turn around in. And our view? Construction and another apartment building. I complained to a manager, who said they were completely booked so there was nothing he could do. We went back to our room, looked online, and were able to book a much nicer room beginning the next day (we were in town for 5 nights). I told the manager I was going to check out the next day. He told me I'd have to pay a $75 cancellation fee! When I balked, he said he'd have to talk to the reservation manager to get that waived, and he'd call me in the morning. We checked out and I told the woman at the front desk that I did not want to be charged the fee. She said ok, and didn't charge me. So, this was the only positive part of the experience. The reservation manager never called me. Aside from all this, I still wouldn't have liked this place- the neighborhood is really sketchy, even though there's a bunch of nice restaurants. We got asked for money every time we walked out of the hotel. As a side note, the Silver Cloud Inn at Lake Union was amazing, for the same price (large suite, free breakfast, free wifi).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17567015">Stayed at this hotel for one night .Good Value, courteous staff.

Very disappointed. First, there is a MAJOR construction project going on across the street. They blow the whistle (literally) at 7:30 and the noise does not subside until the end of the day. I am amazed that the hotel did not disclose this. Second, this hotel has no soul. It is constructed of cheap materials...kind of a hotel IKEA, if you know what I mean. Everytime we left the hotel our keys would de-magnetize and after a while we learned to just stop at the desk on the way back to the room to have them re-programmed...a bit of a hassle as we would have to "wait our turn". They did not re-fill the mini-bar every day. And last, when Saturday finally came and they could not do construction across the street and we could sleep in, the maid service came knocking on our door at EIGHT AM (!) despite that there was a newspaper outside our door (we obvioulsy had not opened our door yet). I would never stay here again. There are so many great hotels in Seattle and this is just not one of them!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7292645">My favorite type of hotel is the kind that makes you feel like you're staying in an incredible home, without any traces of those standard, cookie cutter rooms that are a dime a dozen. I prefer something that offers a distinct personality but also a calming sense of familiarity. That said, I hereby declare that the Hotel Andra in Seattle is the Tina Fey of the hospitality industry - alluring and cool and quirky and fun, all rolled into one. It's a rare find that offers exceptional design, ample space, distinct character, and stellar customer service. I came across the Andra via my secret weapon, aka my friend Steve who just happens to work for the Seattle Convention and Visitor's Bureau. With a prime location in the heart of Seattle's Belltown area and moderate price range (under $200/night), I knew we were off to a good start, and after poking around their website, the vibe and decor seemed like the right match too. I was instantly drawn in by the sleek lighting, clean lines, and tasteful color palette of muted blues, greys, and taupes, with touches of Scandanvian inspiration. The Andra was our last stop during our recent honeymoon vacation, and prior to checking in, I had just made my detour to Cupcake Royale. So as I approached the reception desk with a box of treats in hand, in lieu of the standard welcome, the person behind the counter launched into a bit about how nice it was for me to bring him cupcakes. I played right along - I love it when people loosen up and goof around like that, especially people who work in the higher end of the hospitality world, where more often than not you'll encounter some pretty stiff attitudes. The front desk staff seemed to think they were in a improv group, with me as their special guest star, so score one for the Andra. Score two was finding out upon check in that we'd been upgraded to a suite (thanks to the little Upgrade Fairy, also known as my friend Steve who had put in a call to the manager). Also, the timing couldn't have been better in terms of being granted additional space - we'd accumulated a lot of goodies over the past week, and found ourselves in a serious repacking situation, which meant needing some room to spread out. Wish granted: a corner suite with a spacious living room area that included a flatscreen TV, giant desk, and full length mirror, along with another flatscreen TV in the separate bedroom. The bathroom was also really cute and stylish, and the stash of Face Stockholm products made me a very happy girl. The Andra proved to be the perfect end to our trip - so if you're headed to Seattle, this is the place to stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5729283">Disappointed. Paid a huge amount for a Jr suite or shall I say "tiny suite" no bigger then your average holiday inn, in fact they may be larger in sq ft. Don't let the pictures fool you, its nothing big or special. The bathrooms are so small you could wash your hands as you sat on the toilet.

The bed was very comfortable, and the plasma TV screen and furnishings were modern and stylish. The staff were courteous and helpful at all times. My only criticism was the room service from the Lola restaurant. Not only did they deliver the wrong order, but it was over-salted and over-priced.

Once checked in and in my room, I tried to use the two telephones to make an urgent phone call only to find they were still 'barred' so I couldn't call out. Then 30 minutes later the problem still wasn't fixed. Not offering any solutions I asked to move rooms which was such a hassle for them, even though the facilities in my room weren't working. The following day I put laundry in to be done (at a ridiculous cost) and found only half my things were delivered back to me and no one seemed to know where my missing items were. On the same day a colleague also staying there had his laundry declared lost after it had been missing for two days. By this stage I was quite stressed so booked an in-room massage for the evening asking for pricing in writing. The massge was good, but at the end of it I was told the front desk had quoted the wrong price and I was charged an additional $25.

The fitness room is the same size as a regular guest room. It has a few cardio mechines and a few hand weights. Overall, the room wasn't bad. I was just disappointed that the "suit" is so small.

Overall we had a great experience. We unexpectedly decided to stay at the hotel a second night. After our great experience the first night, we decided to save some money and get the smaller Andra Studio because we didn't think we'd mind a simple size change, we expected everything else to be of the same quality. I can tell you the room size was pretty much the only physical change, but the service the second night didn't reflect it's four star rating. First, the window didn't open. Now this isn't a big deal to us, but when we called the front desk to see if there was a trick to getting the window open (because the windows in the suite opened), the gentleman told us that it doesn't open because of fire code, and all the windows on that floor were sealed shut. I know that's not true because we had stayed on the same floor the night before. We didn't appreciate being lied to. Next, we went to turn on the TV. It didn't work. We checked the plug, it was fine. We called the front desk. They said they'd send someone up to check on it. Forty-five minutes later, a girl from the front desk arrived, announced that maintenance was unavailable and that she was going to check it out. She walked over to the TV, pressed the same power button we had tried and checked the same plug we had checked (just like we told her on the phone). After she was unsuccessful, she told us that she didn't know what was going on, and that she'd try to find maintenance. Another twenty minutes go by, and she calls to tell us that eminence wasn't working and wouldn't be until morning. I told her that was unacceptable because we had plans to stay in for the remainder of the night and were going to watch TV. I requested a new room with a working TV. She told me there were no rooms available and that we'd just have to wait until eminence arrived. I explained that I found it hard to believe that they were sold out all of a sudden, considering we had checked in two hours earlier and they had all kinds of other room options available (including the suite we had stayed in the night before and the mid-range Andra Room). She then told me she'd have to call me back. They ended up moving us and the new room was just across the hall, the Andra Room (and by the way, the windows opened in it, too). This was the second lie of the night. In the morning, we hit the valet key on the phone, to request our car. The front desk answered and said that she'd be happy to have the valet pull the car. We waited ten minutes and walked downstairs (that's about how long it had taken them the day before). When we got down there, there were two valets standing around having a personal conversation. After we stood there for ten minutes, holding the blue valet ticket and tip money in my hand, one of them comes over and asked if we needed our car. I explained that we had called and the front desk said they were going to call out and request the car. He said they hadn't and it didn't surprise him because "it had already happened a few times that morning". All in all, I can't say much bad about the hotel, the rooms or the restaurant. I don't mind little things like the window not opening or having to change rooms because the TV doesn't work. What I do mind is being lied to repeatedly and a supposed four star hotel dropping the ball on customer service in such a big way.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3908299">All the good reviews the Andra gets makes me wonder if I stayed at the same place. My wife and I spent the last three nights of our honeymoon in Seattle at the Andra. I wish it had at least been the first three days of our trip so that we didn't have such an anti-climax. Having read a previous bad review of this hotel, I contacted the Andra in advance to reserve a room on a high floor away from the elevators as soundproofing is non-existent. What room did I get? One on a lower floor opposite the elevator. They were only willing to move us away from the elevator but on the same floor. Our package included champagne and truffles upon arrival. The truffles didn't arrive until our final night after two complaints to the front desk. I handed an item of clothing in to be laundered. It came back ruined. Overall, the Andra is a great looking hotel and would get more marks from me but for the poor service. The only saving grace was the adjacent Lola restaurant which serves up great food.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3907774">first off, the staff at this hotel are JUST wonderful- they all were pleasant, very helpful , and went out of their way to treat their guests well. If you worked Sept. 11-12, 2005, we thank all of you - special thanks to Anthony, who let us weary cruise travelers check in early. The hotel is pretty cool design wise........ they have turned a residential property into a nice place. The downtown location was convient, able to walk to shopping. I dont know if I would walk around at night, one block was nice, the next alittle shady- thou not the fault of the hotel !!! Our room was smaller than imagined. We travelled with our 2 children, and when the rollaway bed was put down, it was tight. The street facing windows (that opened, which was a nice treat) were fun to look out of and gave us wonderful fresh air. The bed was comfortable by hotel standards (thou the Grand Hyatt bed was just incredible ), and had cool blue reading lights. The closet for luggage storage was huge- and had lots of hanger space too. The bathroom too small with new fixtures styled in the 1920-1930 design. The sitting couch was the only seating, and wasn't too comfortable. It was a nice place visually, but dont know if we would stay there again- just wasnt worth the $$. Lola, the ajoining eatery though was superb- wow, what great food !! Ben, our server was friendly and prompt (and cute too!) Maxwell's, Central Ca.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3905875">My stay at the Andra was exceptional. The location was terrific. Within walking distance of Pike Street, Needle, Jazz Clubs, Fine Restruants, and just plain city kicking around. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The staff was the best. The beds were unreal. If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable. My wife and myself were so impressed that we have swore to return for a long weekend. For those who are taking a cruise out of Seattle , like us, plan an extra day or two prior to your leaving and stay at the Andra (about 3 minutes form the debarkation dock) to compliment your trip. You will not be dissapointed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3790165">I chose this hotel for a trip with a girlfriend because it is listed on the Small Luxury Hotels of the World registry. I was disappointed, as the other hotels listed with SLHW have been perfect in every way, and Hotel Andra was truly average. Fine, but average. We stayed for 5 nights. The rooms were fine, but not luxurious. The bathroom was tiny. One of the problems is that no one who works there is over the age of 25. They really need a seasoned, professional concierge who knows what he or she is doing. Here's just one example: I check out early on the morning of our departure, pay a reasonable but hefty bill (after 5 nights) and before turning away, ask the desk clerk for a map to the airport. She proceeds to argue with me about whether I need a map, and how easy it is to get to the airport from downtown Seattle. She finally says, "well, I guess I could print you something off of Mapquest." This should have been a no-brainer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3788533">for $240 (tax incl). Nice room, good shower with no tub, good Turkish towels, that can be a little rough. Pleasant staff that doesn't know too much, like no one knew how long it took to get to the opera house. We were there for the Wagner Ring cycle. Cabs almost impossible to get during rush hour, but very helpful doormen. Biggest asset: Lola's restaurant (through lobby), great bk, dinner, and late night snacks. Would probably return.....<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3547775">I stayed at the Hotel Andra recently for a shopping weekend and had a great time shopping but wasn't blown away by the hotel. The place does have a neat look to it, though the lobby look was a bit undecided- half ski lodge with the fireplace and wood table, and half more clean cut and trendy. The room was fine, nothing spectacular, and I have to agree that the bathroom was quite teensy, and definitely not new, though there were some new pieces in it, I guess. The beds were very comfy though. No problems with onion smells, or the valet, and the girl at the front desk/concierge who checked us in was very helpful and pleasant actually. Would i go back? For a good rate I would, but I'm going to shop around next time to see what else there is. The pieces weren't quite completely pulled together in the room, and the bathrooms were definitely not my favourite, but the location is pretty fantastic. You're right by the shopping, right by the main restaurant strip, a couple blocks from Pike Place market. So for a good rate, and a shopping weekend, it's perfect!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3546904">My husband and I and friends really enjoyed our weekend stay. The rooms were just as advertised and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Lola was also very good. We didn't get to try Assaiggio but we heard some other guests talking about their great experience there. The location is near shopping and the Market. Our room rate was comparable with other hotels we considered but I think the Andra rooms are larger on the average. Would definately recommend to others.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3489209">I was really looking forward to staying at the Hotel Andra as I had seen it be annointed as one of the best new hotels in the U.S. by Traveler magazine. Unfortunately, my stay did not live up to the hype. Things started off bad right off the bat due to the awful valet parking situation at this hotel. The valet parking attendants were not to be found so we sat there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to show up and give us a claim ticket. Throughout the three days we spent there, the valet parking situation was a constant hassle. Sometimes no one was there; sometimes there was no space in front of the hotel to drop off the car because limos and other cars were parked there for the adjacent restaurants; sometimes even when someone was there it took them over 15 minutes to get the car brought around (and this was after calling them from the room ahead of time to have the car brought around). We discovered that the hotel is contracting this service out and will not be providing valet parking service on its own until the beginning of next year. This was a really annoying aspect of the hotel. We tried to check in at 3 p.m. Mind you, we had called ahead of time since we were out shopping and asked if the room would be ready at 3 p.m. and we were assured that it would be. We got to the hotel at 3:15 p.m. and sure enough, the room was not ready. It was not ready for another 30 minutes. The front desk staff was aloof, unhelpful and lacking in social skills. There was only one front desk employee during the course of the three days that actually seemed like he enjoyed helping the clientele. The rest just sat there chatting with each other and barely looked up when anyone passed by. One night we discovered that the valet parking attedant was not outside to take our car because he was inside chatting and laughing with the two girls at the front desk. Needless to say, I was not amused. The previous comments about the hotel smelling like onion is absolutely. . .TRUE. At night when the restaurant in the lobby gets cooking, you will smell onions throughout the hotel. We were on the NINTH floor and we smelled it in the hallways up there. Luckily, the smell did not travel into our room, but every time we walked through the lobby I thought I was going to hurl. It was that strong. Perhaps the front desk people at night were so much like zombies because they had to inhale that awful stench all night long. As far as the room goes, I was very unimpressed. The bathroom was tiny and very hard to get around. The bath products were average at best. I decided to use my own that I had brought from home, and I almost never do that. To their credit, the bed was extremely comfortable. The pillows could have been fluffier though. We had a junior suite, so we had some extra space. There was a couch, coffee table and a small bar area in the living portion of the room. The room had absolutely no view, so we did not spend much time in the room at all. The air conditioning worked well, so that was a saving grace for the room. The location is very good. It is central to shopping and the sights. Personally, I prefer to stay closer to the shops. I definitely recommend the Grand Hyatt Elliott Bay as a wonderful 5-star hotel with impeccable rooms, service and location. The Hotel Andra was very disappointing. I kept trying to be optimistic and find positive things about the experience. But, quite frankly, there were very few things about my stay there that leave happy memories. I would definitely never stay at this hotel again. I just can't express how truly disappointed I am. Book me at the Hyatt next time!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3477688">As an add-on to a work trip, I booked two days at the Andra for my birthday, based on the web-site and positive reviews here. I must say, I left being a little obsessed with the place. 1. I was upgraded to the suite, which of course is just a larger room with a couch. However, it was a very snazzy couch. I asked to see a regular room so I would be able to see what I paid for. It was a standard size room, but... 2. The blue and beige Scandanavian-inspired color scheme is quite striking. I understand that in five years it will need to be redone or it will look both dated and frayed, but for now it is a cut above similarly priced entries. 3. Fascinated by other problems with restaurant smells, I am almost disappointed to say I had no such problems. However, I did have breakfast at Lola. Expensive, but delicious. No octopus for me, but the smashed potatoes were scrumptuous. 4. I cannot abide a hotel that doesn't have a computer room with free acccess. The Lola provides. There is also a workout room. It's small, but I overheard a staff member saying they are planning to move it to a larger space. 5. My local friend told me they pumped a ton of money into this and it shows. But as always, it's the little things that make an impact. I liked the design of the paper coasters. 6. Have you noticed that many new hotel designs don't provide for much in the way of drawerspace? Is everyone living out of their suitcases? I'm sorry, but I like to unpack. 7. Parking is valet only, and quite high compared to the room cost. You can park across the street in a garage and save about $7 a day. But if you're like me and winging it carless, it's not an issue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR89393416">The hotel is in the pleasant embassy quarter in the north east, too far away from the centre to walk, but a relatively easy bus ride away from the Repubblica metro stop. Still, for such a distant location it is an expensive hotel. Upon first view I tended to understand the steep price, because the Principe Torlonia looks great from the outside, and the garden, while not big, is also very nice. The big problem came when entering the room. I should point out that we didn't stay in the main building, so I cannot comment on those rooms. We stayed in one of the special hotel suites in the little, separate building in the garden. While these suites were comfortable enough, the smell of mold and fungi was so strong that one could barely stand it. Ventilation did not solve it, so it must be a persistent problem. For this price this is really unacceptable. So if you decide to stay at this hotel, request that you are in the main building.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72100003">We spent five nights at this hotel and were with friends for three of those nights. What started as a wonderful stay ended not so great and I am really disappointed it ended like that. Initially we thought the hotel was in the middle of nowhere but we hired motor scooters which made our time in Rome a lot more enjoyable and made the hotel in an excellent location! The hotel is close (5-10 minute walk) from a metro stop and is just off Via Nomentana, a fairly main road which connects you quickly and easily to the centre of Rome (very easily on a scooter!). The hotel was refurbished only a few years ago and the rooms are well appointed, some smaller than others but a good size given you are in Europe. The garden is lovely if you are missing a bit of green and sitting outside on the patio is wonderful after a hot day sightseeing. Some of the staff left a bit to be desired. Simon and his Manager were outstanding and despite Simon having only worked there few a fortnight when we visited he was friendly, helpful and he made our stay very good. Luckily the rather arrogant attitudes of the women working there had not rubbed off on him yet. Example, on the night of the FIFA World Cup final, we decided to watch the extra time period in the bar at the hotel. When we politely asked her to switch the TV on she said it didn't work. We knew this not to be true and her just really being too lazy to get up walk ten metres and switch it on because it had been on the previous evening. Slack. She did however feel it necessary to bark at our friend when she was reading a book on the couch (sitting not lying) and tell her that she wasn't allowed to fall asleep! Crazy. Another lady there sent us out with wild directions to a place we had asked for and that she had offered to print out for us (good so far) however she printed them in Italian (English Speakers) and it wasn't even to the right place! Hopeless. Unfortunately as we were checking out, there was a hidden charge for parking our scooters there which we were not told about nor did we think we a valid charge. The scooters were not valet parked nor did they take up much space yet it was a dispute which left us thinking not so great things especially after staying for a total of eight room nights. At least the girl on the desk managed to have a laugh at this one and at the non-sensical nature of the problem! Despite this, Simon and the property made this a good place to stay in Rome. Just don't expect all of the staff to go out of their way for you, in fact don't even expect them to get off their seat for you!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR52052139">The danger in writing a well-deserved, glowing review of the Prime Hotel Principe Torlonia is that too many people will discover it and it will not be available when we want to return! This hotel is a gem nestled among an up-scale neighborhood outside the Historic Center of Rome. While that may not appeal to some, the Bologna Metro B line is a few short blocks away and the distance from the tourist circuit gives the willing traveler a taste of daily Roman life. The restaurants in the area were all outstanding and the nearby supermarket made picking up picnic supplies easy. The staff were all warm and friendly and Ramona, in particular, went out of her way to arrange for tables at restaurants during the hit and miss Christmas holiday. We are particularly grateful for her assistance with our trip. If you want to be in the middle of the Historic Center of Rome near all the tourist spots and everything that goes along with them, this is not the place for you. If you are able to navigate yourself on the public transportation system (or have a rental car or pockets full of cab fare) and want a quiet place to start and end your day in Rome, give this hotel serious consideration.

They could not activate two card keys to our room so that we could both have our own keys. They would fix one and the other would stop working. Breakfast was nothing more than mediocre. And they had the nerve to charge for a coffee refill. There was no privacy and it appeared that our coming and going was "monitored" and we felt like we were staying at our grandmother's place.

We do this on a frequent basis, at least once a month. We ended up getting the Edgewater and were looking forward as we have never stayed there before. What a disappointment. It is not a four star facility in any way. Sure the location is beautiful being a waterfront property. However, it is completely off the beaten path. They do have a shuttle, but it will only take you within a one mile radios and only until 9pm. Our first impression: pulling up to a sign that states parking is a whopping $36.00 plus tax per night ! There is no self parking available. Ouch! Having stayed at many different hotels in Seattle I do know that parking can be expensive. Usually though the hotel will offer self parking options. Furthermore the most that I have ever seen is $20.00 NOT 36.00! Also, the Marriot across the street is $15.00 per night. I did ask the front desk associate if there was any other option, and she really was not concerned in the least, she said we could park on the street and feed the meter every two hours if we wanted! Now, the rooms are outdated, and quite small. The room we got was directly above the front lobby area. It was very loud, with cars pulling up all night and guests coming and going. The hotel is also directly across from some train tracks, so you have the constant noise of the trains all night. Also, the room was not clean at all. From questionable long liquid like stains across from the bed on the wall, to the very dirty bathroom. But the worst part, there is no air conditioning it the hotel at all! So, after playing around with the thermostat I called down and asked. The front desk solution? Either open the window or he would send up a fan! I actually tried to open the window and to my shock, the windows do open all the way. 5 floors up from the ground, with no protection! I have a three and a four year old, under no circumstances would this be a safe solution to ANY parent! So, we suffered in a hot room instead! We will never stay here again, there is no value to staying at the Edgewater!

The room was fine and was the best part of the stay. Bathroom was redone and very nice. Room was somewhat updated. On the downside...the corridors etc felt very old and tired. Also, we were woken several times throughout the night by a train traveling past the hotel. And finally the distance from the hotel to the downtown core was just too far. They did have a shuttle that took us downtown and that was great, but we had to cab it back after a night out at the theater. The staff was neither overly friendly nor rude etc., but nothing memorable either way. We visit Seattle 2-3 times a year and this was our first visit to the Edgewater.

I liked that we could go down to the lounge with a glass of wine and watch the sun set while playing a game of chess or backgammon. Room was nice; not the best view but clean. Our last night we went to the bar for dinner, food was good but very expensive and small portions. The only part of our stay I did not appreciate was on the morning of my departure the maid kept knocking on our door what seemed like every half hour to see if we had left.

I read about the beautiful views of the water and thought that would be nice. Our view was the parking lot and the train crossing. The trains come through about once and hour, so there is no restful sleep when you have one of those rooms. The room was quite small, but the bathroom was a good size. There is no dresser in the room. I also found it odd to have the coffee machine in the bathroom, which doesn't seem very sanitary. The hallways are dark and dreary and look like they need a good cleaning. Our son lives in Seattle and we were going to drive his car back to the hotel in the evenings and park it there, only to find out there was an outragious fee to park there. They don't let the guests park there for free even though they have a huge parking lot. The one good thing about the Edgewater is that they have a very friendly and professional staff. We will not stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126511669">This is one Hotel than can expect a return visit from us! They were almost booked when I set up the reservation, about a month prior to our travel, and only City views remained. Upon check-in, however, "Camille" said a Bay view room was available, for a $50 upgrade. We took it, and this room (454) had a view of both the City and Elliott Bay. Breathtakingly gorgeous. Gas fireplace in the room, which we turned on immediately (temps were only in the 30's that evening). It heated up the room rather quickly. Very clean, with field stone on the floor of the bathroom. Our group of four dined in their dining room and, although pricey, was delicious, both presentation and taste. If no one is staying in "The Beatles Suite" (room 272) ask Camille (front desk) if you can see the room. It's usually booked, but that evening (we were lucky) it was not. All furnishings have long since been renovated, since the Beatles stayed in this room, back in the early 60's, but it was still a thrill for our group to "take in" where the Fab Four once stayed. Photos of the Beatles fishing off the balcony from this room into Elliott Bay are available in their Gift Shop. A classy Hotel, beautiful location, friendly staff (look for Camille). You won't be disappointed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126399863">I have never gone to a site to give a bad review, but don't want anyone else to wasted their time an money thinking they are going to be staying in a beautiful place. I booked the room for a 50th birthday getaway and really wanted the Edgewater for the experience. I normally go through pirceline and get great deals on hotels in Seattle, but given that it was a present and I wanted to be sure of where we would stay, I went ahead and splurged big time on a full waterview clawfoot tub room. I was told by the booking agent that the tub was very large and both of us could easily fit for a nice long soak. She apparently had never seen one of the tubs in person because it was one of the smallest I have ever seen and in no way could be considered large enough for two normal sized adults. The booking agent also said that they would be sure to do something special for his birthday and nothing at all was done. The halls of the hotel are an unbelievable mess with carpet that in not only tread barren, but filthy looking. The bedding had a horrible stench to it that made one wonder how long they allow it to go between cleanings, the bed also squeaked terribly any time you moved. The glass in the doors separating the bathroom and bedroom had hand prints and smudge marks all over it. While the fireplace was lovely, the glass to it was filthy as well and there was a timer for it and at the end of the time the fireplace would turn off and then the timer would start beeping very loudly apparently to warn you that the fireplace had turned off. I'm sorry, but I don't need to be woken up by an alarm an hour after I have turned in to tell me the fireplace turned off!!! I have never stayed at a hotel where the you heard absolutely ever noise that happened in the hall and every single door open and shut while in your room with the door closed. It was as if the door was wide open it was so loud. Unfortunately, the loudest ones in the hallway were the housekeeping staff early Sunday morning. At best, I would say that the hotel is an extremely over priced mediocre Best Western level of quality hotel with a fantastic view and location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126354749">Spectacular room, excellent staff, and off-the-charts terrific dining experiences. I stayed for four days and enjoyed every minute of it. The Edgewater is one of those rare hotels where you are sorry to leave the premises to do your business, even in a beautiful city like Seattle. I entertained some locals who were blown away by the experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126305077">This hotel does a lot of things right: My favorite being the fireplace in my room. It shuts off automatically after an hour, so I'd wake up, turn it on, and then right when I was about to turn in for the night, watch it until I fell asleep. It made my winter stay in Seattle so cozy. Also, it's a short walk to Pike's Place. A small thing I adored, was that they actually have bottles of shampoo and conditioner, instead of those tiny travel sizes. Of course, you can't take it with you, but who needs 1,000 mini bottles of shampoo? They're saving the environment and that is just damn nice. Every morning, I had breakfast on the water. The breakfast food is to die for and the wait staff impeccable. I recommend the oatmeal, made with heavy cream and infused with ginger. A hot cup of coffee, and a few of the bay, it's hard to beat this hotel for a dreamy spot in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126291491">We stayed here because priceline had it rated 4 stars and in the Pike Place Market area; both grossly inaccurate! Our room was slightly larger than the full size bed (aka "queen" according to the front desk) and two people could not stand at the bathroom sink at the same time. There was no desk and a bedside table on one side only. Our room was quite warm when we arrived, despite a thermostat setting at 60.5Â°; we complained and when we returned the room was at 72Â°F (22Â°C). The lower room numbers are quite close to the freight train railway crossing, and a note in the room explains that some guests find this romantic â€”Â especially the bells that ring each time the gates go up or down? â€” while others will want to use the "complimentary earplugs" they provide. I counted at least 4 crossings during our night there, between 11pm and 8am. They do accommodate pets and were great with our dogs.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126212050">The City Queen is not worth $231. Not even 1/4 of it. It's tiny. Tinier than Extended Stay, La Quinta, Holiday Inn, and even some hotels in Europe! You can't lay any piece of luggage flat on the floor &amp; we had 3 medium sized bags! The bathroom looks nice but has unnecessary things. The bed does not look like a queen; looks like a double. And you can only get on it from one side. Also, it's likely very noisy because the train runs by regularly. The larger Water View rooms are better. It's bigger and nicer. The four poster bed is a king sized. The bathroom is much bigger but the granite floor for the shower is uncomfortable. Also, the shower doesn't have a door. It's just covered by a piece of glass that only covers 2/3 of the shower. They have amenities you can only use when you're there which I suppose makes sense, but charging you $25 if you take them is outrageous. Not even the most organic shampoo &amp; body wash would cost $25! That is just stupidly outrageous. The parking is absurd. It is $36 valet only and they park your car out in their open parking lot, so your car will be covered in rain, snow, or hot like an oven, depending on the weather &amp; season. $36? Please! We parked on the street. But it was really annoying to go out, repark it elsewhere when we had to, and drive it up to the entrance to get our bags. I can't believe they have to make it so hard for us. Having stayed there for the night, I noticed more problems. First, it was noisy. I could hear people in the hallway walking &amp; talking and I wear silicone ear plugs. It's like the building is made out wood from the 1930s and the wood is starting to break down. The next night I wasn't as tired &amp; was often woken up by the sound of the train or a ship on the water sounding its horn. As usual, the people in the hallway woke me up. I'm so glad I wasn't stuck in the other levels, where I would've heard people above me. I believe others have complained about this as well. Also, the bed is too soft. The location is not that great. The ships were noisy, the train was noisy, and it's not within reasonable walking distance to Pine &amp; Pike St. I'm definitely going back to La Quinta &amp; Holiday Inn. They're just not as fancy but way more worth it. This hotel spends too much money on unnecessary things. The fake tree branches that can be manually adjusted at different limb points in the lobby area? The tiny elevator with the tv and the holes resembling kelp? The light up mirror in the washroom? This hotel needs a lot of changing for me before I come back or recommend anyone to come.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126205969">I've been meaning to write this review for about 1.5 years now - I love this hotel and everything about it. I'm there on the average of twice a month for business, so I think I know of what I speak! The Edgewater is pure Pacific Northwest. The interior is in keeping with the beauty and style of the area, with high beamed rustic ceilings and big fireplaces. The location is fabulous - it's built on a pier right on Elliott Bay. The view from the water side rooms, restaurant/bar and common area is nothing short of spectacular. You can watch the ferries and sailboats go by, watch the lights come on from across the bay, watch a storm come in, see the Olympics on a clear day - wow, just gorgeous. Every room has a fireplace, which is very cozy and takes the chill off Seattle nights. The bed - it's wonderful - with just the right amount of firmness and cool, crisp sheets. The bathroom is all done in stone - I liked it so much I copied it for a remodel I was doing of our house. The gift shop has the best selection of gifts -- and scarves -- that I always buy something unique there. The staff is superb! I'll do a special call-out to Tanya, the manager and Rick, the bellman. They are so helpful and nice and make me feel very welcome. The bar is a blast - great happy hour with good drinks and small plates. Lunch in the restaurant is amazing, especially the "bento box" lunch where you can taste many of their specialties, including their excellent clam chowder and house made potato chips. I cannot say enough about this hotel. I've traveled a lot, and this is still one of my top 3 places in the world. If you go, spring for the waterside and enjoy!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR126156376">My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Edgewater Hotel. We had a great time. The room was great and the bathroom was terrific. Huge shower, big enough for 2. Our room on the 3rd floor overlooked the water. The view was amazing. We had the best time at happy hour. The waitresses are terrific and fun, and the view is spectacular. The food was really great especially Armondine's salumi platter, the cod fish and chips, and the blackberry wings. At lunch or dinner, try the clam chowder. We had it for lunch, and it was Yummy! There is a free shuttle that leaves every hour on the hour to take you to places close by. That was great. The hotel is within walking distance for Pikes Place Market and other things, if you like to walk. Overall, we had a great time and would love to go back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125899600">We booked online and got a great rate for our five night stay. After the first night with a "city view" room and three freight trains in the morning, we upgraded to a water view room for $50/night. The room was larger, had a balcony and a great view of the harbor and the Olympic Mountains beyond. Breakfast was not inexpensive but was very good as was the view from the restaurant. I thought the four stars was a bit of a stretch - the rooms and hallways were in need of some updating. In all - a great stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125764314">I had bought an internet coupon for my stay. The hotel was lovely and the staff was friendly. However, when I buy an internet coupon I expect it to be honored as such. After buying the $259 voucher for a two night stay, the taxes/fees and parking amounted to an addtional $205 upon check out. I felt ripped off. Though the staff was friendly and the hotel was clean,it was NOT worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR125729690">We booked this hotel online and paid extra... a lot extra, for the waterfront room. This was for a special occaison, and I have to say it was worth it, though I don't feel as good about it knowing some people were able to get that for free. The Edge really does nickle and dime you at every opportunity... 25$ if you tried to steal one of the bath products? 30$ for the teddy bear that your kids will start asking for when you walk in the room? Wifi another extra daily charge. Valet parking another charge. Try not to drive there. There is a shuttle leaving the hotel on the hour, that will take patrons downtown or to the Amtrak station. No charge other than a gratuity for the driver. In the room, you will also find the usual high end hotel items like bottled water, snacks and the minibar. Loved the cute bear ottoman, noticed you can get one in the gift shop for 425$. OK this is a hotel for rich people, we may never do this again. The coffee at least was free, but I called the front desk just to make sure. Now that I've gotten done complaining, on to the good......rooms are comfortable, bathrooms are obviously remodeled and quite nice....the entire hotel is lovely, the staff are outstanding, and the onsite restaraunt, 67, is NOT to be missed. In fact it is a destination on its own. Waterfront views, impeccable service, tasteful, relaxing ambience, and the food was excellent - everything was presented wonderfully and tasted great. We may not be able to afford this hotel again if visiting Seattle in the future, but we will make it a point to visit 67 regardless.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR125608323">Although I usually stay in a hotel within walking distance of the shopping area around Norsdtrom, this was a pleasant change. My only complaint was they charge for WiFi. This in very annoying in a 4 star hotel. Also, there's no self parking so whenever someone came to visit me they paid $6 plus tip. I usually don't hang out in hotel lobbys, but I found this one very inviting with a great view of the Sound. Maybe because I booked through Hotels.com and got a great deal, I had a view of the parking lot. The fireplace was nice and the hotel gift shop is a lot of fun - another unusual element. I'd stay here again if I could get an ocean view.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR125510539">We had stayed here many years ago and had a great time and loved the hotel. Based on our past experience we booked it again for the President's Day weekend with two other friends. What a disappointment this time! The first thing you see when you drive into the parking lot is a sign saying that valet parking is required at $36 per night! It was my recollection that when we stayed the previous time there was no valet parking or that it was optional. It's not like there isn't any parking available at the hotel and that they need to shuttle your car to a lot offsite somewhere; they have a very large parking area similar to what a hotel out by the airport would have, so it appears they are simply charging as a way of sucking more money from their guests. When we talked with the desk clerk about the high cost of parking, we were told that all the hotels in Seattle do it, and while the Edgewater might be a little high, it is in line with what other hotels are charging. Even more frustrating is waiting 10 minutes at the curb for the car jockey to go get your car, when you're staring at your car parked less than 60' away. Valet parking is inconvenient at best for the customer, and the Edgewater's system was poor. Overall the rooms and hallways are very "tired". All the rooms appear to have had the bathrooms upgraded, but for some reason the rest of the room has been left in it's worn out state. Our first room on the water side had a fireplace that had the front glass so sooted up you could barely see the flames. The slider leading out onto the deck had a built in vent in the framework that no longer had a cover on the outside, which allowed cold air to blow into the room unabated all night. Poor maintenance for sure! To the credit of the lobby staff, we were moved to another room the next day after we complained about the two problems mentioned. The staff was the only bright spot of what was otherwise a very disappointing stay. The hotel is in a prime location right on the water, and has the potential of being one of the premiere properties in Seattle, but they've missed the mark. It's almost as though the hotel knows that they established a reputation years ago of being a top-notch hotel, and now they're just coasting without trying to maintain that reputation. Unfortunately we will not be staying here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR125478720">Nicely appointed and beautiful views.

Hotel has a quirky decor that belongs to a woodsy-pine lodge. Lots of rooms in set in a long corridor which is also tired and with frayed carpet. Walked by left-over food trays in hallways to access room. Rooms are poorly insulated for sound. Moved from first room because of noisy "passionate" couple. Woken up twice in new room by TV in next room mounted on adjacent wall! Hotel has decent food! But watch the extras - 36 dollar a day parking, 10 dollar i-net access.

Not worth full price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124873312">We stayed there in February, and despite the dreary weather we had gorgeous views of the water, and woke up to the gulls. The room was small, but cozy with a gas fireplace. The beds have a duvet so nice and comfy. The only issue was the bathroom with its stone floor is FREEZING and you can't go in there with bare feet. No tub either. It is a noisy hotel, presumably because it's older you can hear the pipes, the people around you flush their toilet etc. Otherwise, the room was okay, the view made up for it all. The restaurant in the hotel is awesome. Breakfast was incredible and reasonable. Again, you can sit and watch the tug boats and the ferry, great to sit and have a bottle of wine in the evening.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124689851">We spend 2 nights in February at the Edgewater Hotel. Good part , staff are very nice and helpful they have a shuttle service you drop you downtown, our room was nice with a Santa Fee western style, I was surprise to have a shower but no tub.The location at night is a bit off the way. The bad part, corridor need a good coat of paint and new carpet after all they are suppose to be a 4 stars. They don't mention the train who come every half hour, day and NIGHT so if you are a light sleeper to bad. The city side is more a parking side with no vue and finally the parking $ 49.00 a night................We come to Seattle twice a year and like to try differente Hotel for sure we won't come back to this one<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124499506">This is a wonderful rustic hotel which is walking distance to some great restaurants and quaint little clubs.

The location is conveniently located near downtown and areas of interest. Of course this also includes being next to train tracks. That if your room is not facing the water will most likely hear the noise. Upon first arrival please first know that it is a valet only parking, and do not have public parking. For valet parking it is $36/day which will be added to your bill later. The lobby, staff, and lounge are all nice and noteworthy. They placed used in on the 4th floor facing the street. Hmmmm...was hoping for water front but OK. The room was extremely small, so small that we could barely fit our luggage in the room and get it past the bed. I seen bigger rooms in Manhattan. We did hear what ever noise machinery was on the room and train throughout the night. The flatscreen TV in the room was old and had bad static. The phone seemed like it had not been clean for a few years. As well as the clock in the room was off by about 5 hours. The bathroom was the nicest part of the room with a upscale contemporary look and rock shower. After 2 days we decided to ask for a room facing the water and a bigger room. They were about to say no, but luckily they found a room on the first floor. Upon entry into the room it was definitely bigger. The funny thing is the lady said "oooooh yeah you are in our smallest room available". The room did face the water, but faced the pier side with a giant crane in front of the room. Not exactly what I was looking for but atleast its bigger, and our last 2 nights went smoothly. So overall..make sure you ask when staying for a waterfront room that is a good size and not on the fourth floor.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124250687">We were taking a cruise, and eliminated the stress and hustle of getting to the cruise terminal by staying at the edgewater! We simply walked next door, literally! No kidding, you can walk from the hotel to the terminal! The hotel has a look and feel of an "inn" or lodge which added to the pleasure of our trip. Service was great and the restaurant was also good. We walked to the monorail, the market, coffee shops, restaurants, and had amazing views of Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR124169366">This place was interesting. In general it seems like a pretty nice hotel, and maybe our room was just not great, but overall it felt very old and dated. The lobby, lounge area, bar, and restaurant look incredible (directly on the water with beautiful sunset views), but we didn't spend much time there, as we had other things to do in the city. That ended up being a problem, as the hotel isn't very close to anything downtown. It's a walk up the hills to get anywhere (unless you're walking down the street to the aquarium), so we found ourselves wishing we had picked a more central hotel. The bathroom was nice and modern, but even though the room had apparently been renovated fairly recently, it felt old. Our room was also very small. It faced the city rather than the water, and since there are train tracks running right down the road we had noise very often, throughout the nights and mornings. The hotel provides you with a set of "complimentary" earplugs, which is nice of them... I guess? If we had a larger room, weren't next to the train tracks, or spent significant time in the bar/lounge this place could have been really nice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124136581">We chose this waterfront hotel for the location and the larger rooms can hold a family of five. Being the only hotel on the water, it was enjoyable falling asleep to the sounds of water lapping. The hotel rooms all have working fireplaces, really! Welcoming you is a black teddy bear on your bed. The bathrooms were modern, slate tiles with a soothing rainshower. On each visit, we had waterfront rooms, we did not visit the restaurants, however they looked quite nice. The hotel is situated on Pier 67, perfect for a walk to Pioneer Square, Pikes Place Market, all the fun restaurants on the Pier, as well as the Olympic Nature Park. We took the hotel's courtesy vehicle when possible; this was a very nice benefit. If you are taking a cruise on the Norwegian Cruise Line, their pier is literally right next door. Each morning we woke up to a large cruise ship, we never heard them arrive. Anyway, this make for a very convenient stop the night before a cruise...wish I had thought of that when we traveled by cruise to Alaska.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123849985">We stayed at the hotel as short vacation with my wife.

The hotel was about 10 minutes walk to Pikes market. They had a shuttle service (hourly) to take you within 2 miles. We found staff very friendly. My biggest issue was with the rooms and their thin walls. In our upgraded room I could hear our next door neighbor through the connecting door till 5:45 AM . I wrote an email to the hotel general manger about it and have not received a feedback yet. I also found their heater too noisy (could not hear the TV when on).

Waste of money and valuable time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123800324">I found our stay at the edgewater hotel to be an overall disappointment. My first complaint was the price of parking, costing somewhere in the range of $30+/day, which was enough to motivate us to take the train and use public transportation during our short visit. Secondly, the hotel offers wifi, but charges hotel guests about $5/hour and $10/day for use! The cheapest room in the hotel is well over $100/night and yet they feel it's warranted to charge for Wifi!?!? I've stayed in hostels that provide more complimentary services than the Edgewater. We also ordered the pancakes from the breakfast menu and found tem to be very dry, requiring a knife to cut. On to the positives... The Edgewater is conveniently located on the waterfront with a wonderful view of Peugeot Sound. It's a short walk to Pikes place market (about 15 minutes), and the 99 bus picks up in front of the hotel. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. We didn't done in the restraunt suing our stay, but it looked very nice and they have live music on the weekend. My opinion towards hotels is that it's a place for me to sleep while I'm enjoying whatever location I'm visiting. I'd prefer to save some money on lodging, and spend it anywhere else but hiding away in a hotel room. If you don't mind spending a lot of money on a room and plan on spending a lot of time around the hotel, the Edgewater is very comfortable and in a beautiful location. If you just need a clean quite too to sleep in, I'm sure there are better options in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123760785">Such a great hotel...where to begin? How about first thing in the morning with the bed you will wake up in at the Edgewater. You will find that it is the perfect combination of comfy cozy and essential support. No complaints - just a great night sleep. Next, you might wander into the bathroom. Here you are going to be met with awesome design and attention to detail, not to mention one of the best showers ever. From the well equipped and well designed bathroom to the bed/living room that boasts a fireplace, every part of the guest room is full of Pacific Northwest style and flare. Downstairs in the lobby the ambiance continues with lots of fireplaces, comfy couches, stunning views and a friendly staff. If you venture down to 67 for breakfast you won't be disappointed. They make a perfectly pouched egg and present a beautiful plate of fresh fruit. Again, the view is amazing for watching the sun come up in the morning while enjoying a cup of coffee. If you decide to let them valet park your car it will be worth it. All the men at the valet desk are super helpful and always very friendly. When you venture out from the hotel you won't have far to go to get to some major landmarks such as Pike's Place Market and some of the big shopping centers in the downtown area. Overall, staying at the Edgewater was a great experience and we will be back in the future. The prices were reasonable and well worth the stay. From the location to the staff to the guest rooms, every aspect of the Edgewater is top notch.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123744927">First stay at the Edgewater. We were in town for a wedding so we werenâ€™t planning to be at the hotel much. I landed this hotel on Hotwire, which worked out great since many others were staying there as well. I had planned ahead and being a saving traveler, I knew I wasnâ€™t going to pay $36 plus tax for parking if I didnâ€™t have to. Parking in the city hotels really has gotten out of control. Sometimes, depending on which hotel you can land some cheaper parking close by, which is what I did. There is a parking garage directly across the street on Wall Street (entrance on Elliot as well). I parked for $21 even. Check in was a breeze and staff was very friendly. Hotel lobby was nice and had a great view of the water. We got a City Lodge room on the 4th floor. I will say overall, there is a lot of walking to and from the rooms at this place. Itâ€™s an older historical type hotel so it does have a lot of character, but be ready to walk. The room, while small was a great room. It had a queen bed, Flat screen TV, a chair and table, etc. The fireplace provides heat for the room. I liked that the window actually opened, unlike many hotels these days. The bathroom was amazing with a great shower. The shower was great for a tall person like me and had a fancy shower head that rains on you. Sorry, I donâ€™t know what they call those, but it was nice. It also had a detachable massage type shower head as well. The room had a mini bar with liquor, beer, and snacks; everything had an expensive price on it (as expected). There was an ironing board, bath robes, and a spacious closet in the room as well. The train runs right out front of the hotel and since we were on the city side, you can hear it, if your window is open. If you keep the window shut they provide pretty good sound proofing. It was easy to catch a cab and the valet guys were friendly and helpful in calling one for you. At the end of the night we did partake in some drinks at the Hotel bar which was large, spacious, and had a band playing. I was surprised that the bar closes at 12, even with a pretty full crowd. But at this point in the night we shouldnâ€™t have been drinking still. ï�Š The hotel offers a 12pm checkout which is nice and they have checkout via the TV, although ours wasnâ€™t working. Front desk staff was again friendly and check out was a breeze. I just got the car and parked near the valet while we loaded. The valet guys seemed to be a little irritated with this, but there were no regular parking spots. Overall, we had a nice stay. I would stay here again, especially if I had some more time to spend at and near the hotel. We did have lunch at Anthonyâ€™s which is a short 5 minute walk, if that. There is also a deli on the way to Anthonyâ€™s. I read that the hotel has a shuttle for downtown, which may come in handy, since this is farther down the waterfront near the cruise ships areas. I have one more stay next month in Seattle so I am excited to try yet another Seattle Hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123718626">Agree with those who were treated well, but hotel is outdated. REALLY long hallways, longer than the largest Vegas hotels, but also dark and extremely narrow. Standard rooms are TINY. One person can survive a night, but hopeless for two people. Showers are attractive, but poorly planned. If you are under about 5'10" it is hopeless to try and reach the water diverter and you will need to reach it. If you stay, you need to have a waterfront room. The city side rooms face the railroad tracks. They furnish free earplugs, and you might likely need them. The worst thing about the tracks is the trains vibrate the parking lot and set off car alarms ALL NIGHT LONG! To help with this, valet parking is required, at $36 per night, which makes their attendants resonsible for your alarm. The Beattles stayed here, but you will likely be more comfortable elsewhere. Really wanted to like the place with the cute rooms and GREAT location, but was miserable. I stay in hotels between 150 and 175 nights per year and feel well qualified to offer a less than perfect review. Shop by and have a meal in the great restaurant with the superb views, but do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123651395">Had a wonderful view of the sound and the port, ocean-going ships, sea lions--plus a cozy fireplace. Our room was delightful, happy hour in the 67 Pier bar was lots of fun with Brianna as our server. Breakfast was a very good--I particularly liked the oatmeal. Our server every morning was Ali and she was great. We did not have a car so walked or took the hotel shuttle to lots of different attractions downtown. We would highly recommend the Edgewater to others.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123590520">Edgewater is built out onto a pier, so it really is over the water. The rooms are lodge decor, with a cozy fireplace. If you upgrade to the nicest rooms, be aware that the higher room numbers are out farther, are completely unobstructed. And you should upgrade because the views are amazing. Plus the soaking tub was lovely, as was the newly decorated bathroom. The room decor could use some upgrading--the bedspreads are in need of a change. Absolutely do eat at the restaurant--great food, beautiful decor, right on the water. And we enjoyed the nightclub afterward, which had good live entertainment. Breakfast was great too. The one negative? No free internet which drives my husband nuts.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123338610">We stayed on a Sunday night in December. The rooms are nice but ours was pretty small. The fire place has great ambiance but when it is on it puts out a lot of heat for a small space and the mechanics of it are really loud, we couldn't have it on and carry on a conversation, plus had to have the slider open all night for cool air. It's a good thing that there was only water out side. The bathroom has been redone with the obligatory rain shower head but since it is in the far end with a glass wall there is no way to turn it on with out getting all the way in and standing under cold water. The shower wand is a nice touch but there is no obvious way to turn it on. A shorter person wouldn't have had a chance. There is a small lever on the top of the shower head. The card implores one to conserve water but there is no where to hang up a towel to dry, how about a couple of towel bars? there is room for one but the towels are folded and stacked. There is no sound proofing between the floors, we were on the ground floor and could hear every step and movement from above all night long. Our party of 7 had dinner in the 67 which is a beautiful space but when every one had to get out their cell phone to get enought light to read the menu it should be a sign to lighten it up. The servers don't have little flash lights, we asked, and their was no candle light. The server said they could turn up the chandelier but never did. This hotel has great ambiance but many of the design decisions are not guest friendly. A great example of placing esthetics over practicality.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR123319350">It is delightful to be right on the water at this hotel. Sitting in front of the fire looking out to the Sound on a rainy day is delightful. Rooms ar comfortable if a bit odd in having a mountain lodge theme replete with teddy bears. Service is terrible and it is a long way and a long hike up hill from anything one might want to do in Seattle. Pricey for what you get - there are plenty of fabulous hotels for the same rate or less in this great town. But hey! the Beatles stayed here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123242597">Thoroughly enjoyed our two night getaway at the Edgewater! It was everything and more than we expected. This hotel has its very own style and feel. It will not be like anywhere else you have ever stayed. The rooms are cozy! Love the intimate fireplaces and renovated bathrooms. Our waterfront view was amazing with the ferry coming and going. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful. We will definitely stay again. Couple of recommendations... WiFi should be complimentary in keeping with the times. A 24 hr room service menu would be awesome. And as I see mentioned throughout the reviews, more affordable parking. I did appreciate the heads up I received on booking about the cost of parking. This allowed me to make alternate arrangements that saved me 80+ dollars. Thanks for a wonderful stay, Edgewater!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR123164810">The Edgewater Hotel in Seattle has been there since the '60s when it was "the" place for rock stars. The Beatles, Roy Orbison, Mick Jagger &amp; the Stones as well as anybody who was anybody in those days stayed at this great hotel. You used to be able to fish from your rooms in those days. The hotel sits out over the water...the only one like this...in Puget Sound. You just can't get any closer. If you fell out your window, you'd be in the water. There is a great bar and restaurant, beautifully designed, and part of the bar edges around the restaurant, outside. Food is great too. Rooms are not very fancy, nor big, but have so much 'woodsy' character and such terrific views, that the place is hard to beat. Within walking distance along Alaskan way to all the waterfront restaurants. Just next door to the Victoria ferry terminal, and on the otherside, there's a cruise ship dock. Up a few blocks is the main shopping center for Seattle's downtown area, and the monorail which goes to the Seattle Space needle. Cannot say enough about this wonderful Hotel and its perfect location. Oh yes, and on Thursday evenings, the Seattle Yacht Club has its sailing races and the boats get so close to the rooms and the main lobby and restaurant that you can see the faces on the sailors. Just phenomenal!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122413067">TripAdvisor, you've failed us. I cannot believe that this hotel is receiving any positive reviews from people who stayed there. I can totally understand someone falling in love with the lobby, the location or the restaurant... they're all wonderful with beautiful views on the water. Walking distance to everything... but actually stepping foot down the hall on the way to the rooms is a totally different experience. We had a bad feeling immediately upon arrival as the woman checking us in with frigid and uninformed... but we figured maybe she was just upset about having to work on New Year's Eve. Our bags were loaded onto a cart and followed behind us as we headed down the long, dark, disgusting, damp hallway. The smell of cigarette soaked carpet was thick; the water stained walls closed in on us. I could swear those creepy twins from The Shining would show up any moment. Because there is only one elevator (that we could find) we walked a very long way down the hall just to get there... if it weren't for all the effort put in to arriving, I would have opted for the stairs. That elevator does not look like it would pass inspection! Up to the 4th floor - so I held out hope... maybe it was just the ground floor that was so gross and dark... maybe the 4th floor would bring a bright, clean hall. Nope! Another dark, narrow, dank, creepy, stinky hallway led us to our closet... I mean room. The "room" was about the size of my walk-in closet of my studio apartment. It was so small that we had to take turns walking around so that we didn't cause a two-person traffic jam at the foot of the bed. So you're probably thinking - "well in a room that small, I at least hope they have a fireplace to burn you alive while you sleep!" Exactly! The fireplace (that we could not turn off) pumped out heat all day/night. Easy fix: open the window! Yes, the window that opens up to roaring train tracks and has no protection whatsoever from the elements, insects or suicide attempts... once opened, not even a flimsy screen separates you from the wonderful wet Seattle air. Making the best of it - we headed out for a fantastic night at the EMP's NYE bash. Arriving back to the hotel around 2am we called the front desk to inquire about a 24 hour room service menu (not an uncommon find at decent hotels around the world!) But apparently our request was absurd. The person who answered laughed at us. I'm sorry you had to work on NYE buddy, but don't be rude to the people who you are paid to assist! Terrible. Word of advice: if you, for some God awful reason, find yourself in the hell hole that is The Edgewater hotel on the "city view" side... do not attempt slumber without the ear plugs (one pair provided on your night stand... yes, they know it's bad). The train and road noise is unbearable. I woke up every half hour absolutely terrified. The train is so loud that it sounded like we were tied to the tracks. So - close the window, right? Yeah... let's not forget about that fireplace two feet from the bed. The location of The Edgewater is fantastic. Everything else was so bad it was actually funny by the end of our stay. Rude staff + filth + stench + tiny room + ear-splitting noise...I think I'd wake up hungover from this place even if I didn't have a drop to drink the night before. I felt like we must have been on some hidden camera show... things just kept getting worse and worse. I'd stay at a Motel 6 in Werapeyouwhileyousleepville rather than ever step foot in this place. YUK.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122405783">We chose Edgewater for our New Year's Eve get-away as it offered a very nice view of the Space Needle and the fireworks display, plus was billed as an iconic Seattle landmark that catered to many celebrities such as the Beetles, Led Zeppelin, etc. Unfortunately the price value didn't match the hype; particularly for the traveling family. We had booked a family suite with a balconey and a Space Needle view. Turns out you can't have both so we obviously opted for the view but now in a smaller room, (for the same price). On site parking is by valet only and is over $40 w/tax however there is a parking garage across the street for $21/day. Close to Pike Street Market and obviously the waterfront. Close to Seattle Center, and Space Needle but quite a hill climb. On site shuttle is available but not on demand; it's by their schedule. Very expensive restaurant on site but nearby is Spaghetti Factory. No luggage carts available; all controlled by bell hops; for a fee. (Small) gift shop has a bistro but limited hours. Lobby has a western lodge theme for some reason and then store-bought posters of various rock bands over the fireplace, (none autographed by-the-way). Rooms, decor, etc. Reminded me of a Travel Lodge type inn but at a 5-star hotel price.

Location is a pro but also a con - I personally LOVED having an ocean view and being right on the water, however it was a bit tougher to walk into the city center. Having said that, they do offer a free shuttle service to any part of the center you desire. They also schedule pick-ups.

Be careful using the internet access you will be charged not for internet access but for each individual device you use. I used my laptop for emailing and so did my wife. After that she downloaded a book on her ereader. That resulted in three charges. Given the price of the room it should not be necessary to hike to one of coffee shops in the neighborhood that has free internet access.

We have stayed at the Westin every year past and decided to try the edgewater this year. It's been a mistake since the start. As someone else has stated the beauty begins and ends at the fireplace outside the entrance. We were never greeted at te door, with kids in tow a door held open is always a nice gesture. After check in we walked the long, dark, dank and very stinky hallwall to our room. Gross. We called once in the room about the old musty, stale cigarette smell. Yuck. They promptly moved us to rm 352. Smell was better, but little did we know then that the walls are paper thin! The edgewater provides earplugs for the train, ha! We needed more than one pair, the whole family was up all night from the noise of people normally talking in hall. This room also happened to be above, below or next door to the laundry. So we enjoyed the racket of that early in the as well. We are so disappointed with this hotel. The rooms need some help, from the old carpet you do not wish to walk barefoot on, the 15 inch tube tv in the giant armoire, tiny beds and gross ring stained toilet. Do the fireplaces even turn on? We will not be back, ever. We have enjoyed the restaurant 67 in the past, amazing food...we would expect the same from the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121769347">My wife son and I stayed at the Edgewater this past labor Day and really enjoyed our stay.

Beautiful views of Mt St. Helena and a fireplace in the room what more could you ask for...well being alone with my wife for one thing. The bathroom had a remarkable rock designed theme. The hotel is right next to the Clipper Lines that bring you in from Vancouver/Victoria. This hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to Pikes Fish Market and the hotel is on the free bus route to take you to Pioneer Square or a short walk to the Space Needle. The restaurant in the hotel has an excellent brunch. Don't miss all the music memorabilia off the front desk in a sitting room. Great romantic place even though we had our son with us.

I put in a low ball Priceline bid for a 4 star hotel and wound up with this hotel. Having never stayed there, but seeing the place a few times, I thought great. Check-in was quick. The valet guys are quick. Kind of over a barrel there though, because you aren't really close to anything and the parking is $34. Had a city view room on the 4th floor. Whoa, so small...Almost as small as a cruise ship cabin. As others have said, no dresser drawers for clothes. The closet was pretty big though. The bed seemed pretty hard and was more like a double than a queen size. There was a gas fireplace in the unit, but due to the size of the room, you got so hot so fast, you couldn't keep the thing on without opening the window full, then you got the full on train noise as the BNSF mainline is right outside the window. It was good of them to leave ONE set of ear plugs on the night stand, hahahahaha...There was a fridge in the cabinet above the fireplace. The TV was a 32 inch flat panel, so that was good. I did like the bathroom. I like the stone tile work and the rain shower. Good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Coffee maker worked fine, but the coffee was crappy. I didn't like the hallways. They were dark and really needed a sprucing up. Paint was chipped, the carpets are old and dirty. The smell of stale cigarettes was everywhere even though its a non-smoking place. There appears to be only one elevator for the place and it is SLOW...Add to that, the fact they were moving beds and using this elevator to do it when people are in the process of checking out. Perhaps there is no freight elevator. I did like the lobby and common area lounge. The view was nice out over Puget Sound, West Seattle and Alki Point. Didn't try the restaurant, so can't comment there. I wouldn't really rate this as a 4 star property...3 and a half tops. Maybe the rooms facing the water are bigger and quieter, but I wouldn't stay in one of those small rooms again. This is not in the same league as the Sheraton Seattle, The W, or the Westin, but they all share the same rating...Go figure...No pool or spa here either. Another thing, even though you are on the waterfront, it is a long walk to the piers where the restaurants are and also to Pike Place Market and downtown. You must either cab it or have a car, especially if the weather is bad.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121671204">We stayed at the Edgewater for our first annual Christmas weekend in Seattle.

Our shuttle driver, Kevin, was friendly, helpful and knowledgable about great places to have breakfast.

In this economy room, there is no dresser for clothes, and no mini frig. The bathroom is nice but again small. The glass shower wall is high but it's a 3/4 length to the opposing wall so expect some water to get on the floor.

VERY rustic, strange fake trees every where in the lobby. Kind of dark? We received our room key and proceeded down a long creepy dingy, smelly,narrow hallway to our room. We were shocked to find out that we didn't have a water view! The room was so small there was barely room for a bed! Immediately I called the front desk I was told that they were out of waterview rooms. We were given an option of a room with 2 beds. The new room was normal in size. Nothing exciting. Needless to say totally disappointing. Will not be back and we are not recommending to family and friends. We had stayed 2 days prior at The Hyatt Place near the space needle.

The view of Elliot Bay from our room was beautiful and the outside deck spacious. However the decor can only be described as odd. A "mountain cabin" theme, with an Eastern inspired bathroom. The elevator was dirty, with worn carpeting.The lounge was lovely. A real plus is the hourly shuttle service to the downtown area, and the hotel is within walking distance of harborside shops and restaurants. I might add that the room was very clean, but the empty cabinets that once housed the old style televisions should be removed. I think this hotel needs a remodel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121463931">The Edgewater had a friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff that made up for the fact that our room was very poorly designed. The bathroom lighting makes it impossible for women to put on their makeup, do their hair or complete the myriad other tasks they must accomplish before going out the door. The bed was not up to the standards of any of the other hotels I stayed in over the last several years. The hotel has a great location, being the only hotel that is located right on Seattle's waterfront and it is convenient to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Seattle Center, and many of the other neighborhoods of Seattle. One of the hotel's claims to fame is that the Beatles stayed there during their 1st United States tour in the 1960s. As a result they have a number of photographs of the Beatles and other entertainers who stayed there over the years. Their downtown shuttle is a very nice amenity, and I cannot praise the staff too highly. They were friendly, accommodating, efficient, and thoughtful. The hotel was quiet in the room had a gas fireplace. Unfortunately controlling the temperature was difficult, and it was frequently to warm in the room, which caused us to turn the heat off completely. The only meal we ate at the hotel was breakfast, and the food and service were both excellent. We did have a waterfront room, and since we looked at the rooms on the other side of the hallway, I would agree with Kaytwowa, do not even think about staying in any room that does not have a water view. From the other side of the hotel you see the parking lot, the soon to be torn down Alaskan Way Viaduct and the railroad tracks. Surprisingly, the trains were barely heard inside our room, and we never heard our neighbors, so the hotel is obviously well constructed from a sound standpoint.

So I had to go for a additional room which of course costs extra. Although the breakfast itself was good the service was really bad.

Chose Edgewater because of it's "historic" past and location on water. Loved it. Northwest cozy lodge decor in a progressive way. We chose a city view since we had an evening wedding to attend and didnt' figure we'd spend a lot of time in room. The view was parking lot, train tracks, buildings across the street and some skyline which inlcuded the space needle. We didn't hear the train or any other noises to bother our sleep. The room was small but adequate and nicely furnished - the bed was very comfortable. Looked just like the photo on line. Loved the fireplace in room. My biggest complaint with room is the bathroom, although upscale with a slate walk in shower and flooring, bowl sink, granite counter, etc, it was so dimly lit it was hard to see, let alone apply makeup. The light in the shower went on and off at will and the light switch for the vanity lights was outside the bathroom and it took us awhile to figure that out! We had a late night drink in the lounge where they had live music, which was really good. Nice atmosphere. Breakfast in the restaurant was fantastic, maybe a little slow but worth the wait. At least the window table gave us a good view while we waited. Overall our experience was a very good one. We would stay there again. Next time I will leave more time to sit in the great hall and read a book by the windows. Lots of cozy options to sit and read and sip your drink of choice. Valet parking seems silly since they have a large lot right there and not a parking garage 3 blocks away.

Our balcony, right above Elliott Bay, was the perfect location to view the waterfront and see Mt. Rainier, when the weather was clear. Being right next to the pier for the cruise ships to Alaska and the ferries to Victoria and the San Juan Islands make its location ideal for these trips and walking distance to almost all the attractions. The hotel also provides a shuttle service within a two-mile radius.

We were aware of the noise factors by taking a room on the non-ocean side as there are enough other reviews to cover this - but in hindsight we should have listened and paid whatever it took to avoid the parking lot/railroad side. We barely slept because of it. We did try to upgrade but the hotel could not accomodate us. My main beef however was the dining room where we did enjoy a lovely wine at a window table overlooking the water. We ordered a bottle of red wine for which we paid $52.00. We liked it so much that the next day we searched for where we could purchase it. Imagine our shock to find it at Cosco and web order wine sites for less than $9.00 per bottle.

I arrived in Seattle very late on a Monday night for a conference that started the next morning.

Check in service was great. The room not so much. The room was average size. The good is that the view, and I was on the water side, is amazing. The fireplace is a nice touch. I thought the bathroom was above average, but did not match the room at all. The not so good: The furniture and decoration of this room is bizzare and not really nice. The too much furniture is old and worn. Only one phone and has to be moved to be reachable from the bed. There were no less than 3 competing plaid patterns, too much furniture which included a huge 4 poster bed. The tv is oversize for the room. The room is worn, chipped paint, bad scratches on the doors, tired paint. There were stains on the paint in the bathroom.

We were most upset with parking. On the way in it said $43.00 valet parking. We foolishly assumed this was a one time charge and since we didn't plan on using our vehicle while we were there we decided that the $43 dollars would be fine. Upon check out we were charged $86.00 for parking!! After not having used our vehicle the entire time! That's $86.00 for 2 days!! Outrageous! When we asked the front desk about the charge they were rude stating that we should have asked about street parking, but that is often limited. The Edgewater is abusing the fact that there is no where else to park and therefore can charge big money for a service you have no choice but to use. This and the general service at the hotel left us with a bad taste in our mouths. You can do better in the same neighbourhood, shop around. NOT A 4 STAR!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120680173">Stayed at the Edgewater just one night for a business meeting, but would love to go back and stay longer. Although some people think the rooms are small, the two of us found it to be very comfortable and spacious. Love the fireplace sitting area. The ocean view is awesome and worth spending a little more to have it. I would love to have the updated bathroom in my own house, including the french doors. Although a bit pricy, the food was excellent. All staff members were friendly, polite and helpful. Enjoyed the photographs of all the musicians who have stayed there, including the Beatles. Never heard the train once. Would go back in a heartbeat!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR120575923">My husband and I stayed at The Edgewater Hotel the third weekend in September. We live in the area and needed a short weekend to ourselves and away from the kids. Overall, I enjoyed the hotel and thought the room (although small) was perfect and lovely. We had a waterview and enjoyed sitting out on the balcony watching the ferry go by. My only complaint was upon check in and check out. We were using a gift certificate and the staff did not seem to know what to do with it. They got us checked in and said they would work it out but upon leaving we were billed (when it should have been free). After that got figured out, I was shocked to see the hotel had charged over 1,000.00 to our debit card! A few phone calls later it was cleared up but was a bit of a hassle to a otherwise nice weekend.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119668533">the good: excellent location 2 blocks north of PPmkt. Nice bathrooms and nice views of the Sound IF you have a waterside room. The bad; tired rooms that are dirty. Carpet was gross and please look under the TV station to see what I mean. Old TV not high-def and a 4.95 PER HOUR charge for wireless service. Ice machine hard to find and not maintained well. Poor lighting in rooms and no CFL bulbs at all.

Location isn't bad but I would rather walk 10 miles then stay here! The nicest thing was the front entrance fireplace outdoors! First night the next door neighbors were drunk and had their music on very loud but it sounded like it was our room! I could hear every word and we turned our tv up on max and the music and the 2 voices overruled our tv. I called the front desk and they told me I had to deal with it till 11pm! Wtf?!! He was rude and basically hung up in my face as if I was being unrealistic! I can handle music next door but this was like I was sitting in their room! So they went on drinking and talking for about another hour with the music on bust! Then went out and came home about 4am drunk ad loud! So first night ruined! The hotel stunk like an old house! I had to spray stuff around our room it was so bad! The room was small and we had no where for our suitcases. The bathroom was nice but don't dare take the stinky cheap shampoo cuz they charge you $20 and I am sure it's a bottle they keep refilling. Oh the best part $200 a night and no FREE Internet!!! Yes you read that right! Who in this day and age doesn't have free wifi?! I forget the price of it but I told them they were crazy! And vallet parking $34 a night! Needless to say we did not tip them once! Complete rip off! Every turn this Hotel wa charging for something! No vending machines and the gift shop had like 2 types of drinks to buy! The walk to the room was endless dreary and dark! I've stayed at many hotels and some not the best quality but never ever left with a complaint or a feeling of being raped of our money! We even checked out a day early and headed back to Canada. It actually ruined my Seattle visit and we usually make the best of any situation. All these awards mentioned on their website must have been given back at the grand opening on the 1930s or soemthing!

Mind you, I'm using my 3G connection because they charge up to $4.95 per hour for Wifi. Ridiculous. If you want their "environmentally" shampoo in the room, you pay an extra 25 bucks. Ridiculous. The entry way was not welcoming. The architect was either incredibly inexperienced, had no budget, or the land must be mysteriously misshapen or something, because this place is laid out terribly. The hallways are LONG and dank. A friend made the comment as we walked the long corridor that it reminded her of the "Shining". Creepy. This place is overpriced. Perhaps my expectations are too high. If I pay a fair few bucks for a room, I expect a welcoming, comfortable room and layout. I think they went for a log cabin/western theme, but it feels old and stale. On top of all this, they still want to nickel-dime you with this other nonsense. We won't be returning.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119400637">My husband and I stayed at the Edgewater for 4 nights in a city view room that was located on the the 3rd floor. We travel a lot and typically stay in upscale hotels. First, I would like to say that the staff here were very friendly and the housekeeping did an exceptional job of keeping the room clean each night. The hotel itself is an older hotel and I would not consider it an upscale hotel but we still had a pleasant stay. The room itself was small and cozy with a great fireplace. The bathroom on the other hand was great &amp; would definitely hold up in a 4 star hotel. The room itself I would give a 3-star rating. The TVs were not LCD/flat screen and you could see the age of the room. The pillows and the bed were not comfortable for us. The train did keep my husband up at night. I took sleeping pills so I slept through the train. We did not like the fact that you had to pay for internet but this did not take away from our stay b/c there were coffee shops in the area that did offer free wi-fi. The cool part about this hotel was it was over the water. We did enjoy our stay but I am not sure if it would have been so great if we had paid full price on it. We bid on it using Priceline so that is probably why I title it "a pleasant stay at the Edgewater". I think if we would have paid full price we would have been disappointed. I would stay here again but not if I had to pay full price....so sorry Edgewater! We do thank u all for being so nice to us during our stay!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119351334">I spent four nights here in late September 2011. The hotel is located on a dock, over the water. The bar and restaurant look out over the bay - a beautiful view and a nice way to end the day. My room was "boutique smallish" but all you need, clean and comfortable. The Space Needle was a 12 minute walk; Pike Market was a 20 minute walk, Poineer Square was a 30 minute walk. For the later two walks, you spend most of your time on the docks, which are colorful and full of restaruants. I highly recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119277208">The Edgewater in Seattle is definitely a place I would stay at again. The reviewer who gave it a "poor" rating, must be in another Edgewater hotel in another town. I almost didn't stay there because of some of the things said by that reviewer. I saw no shabby furniture and no mold. Just exceptionally well done decor carrying out a blend of "Upscale cabin in the woods" and a "modern motif." We stayed in the Family City-View suite which is large enought to sleep 2 teenagers and their grandparents. The kids loved the 2 TV's. The bath had none of the standard cookie cutter hotel fixtures. I personally would like to bring my contractor out and redo my bathroom exactly like it. Everything was scrupulously cleaned. As for the restaurant, I only had breakfast; but it was exceptional. The restaurant has a senic view, top notch staff and they serve the best breakfast I have ever had. Try the crab frittatas. It is pricy and has valet parking, which was expensive. But I will stay again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118821176">We booked a Waterview room at this hotel for 2 nights...That in its self was a joke because both days a cruise ship was docked right in front of our window blocking any view...but I am getting ahead of myself...going to your room is a trip down long rather dingy and shabby hallways. Very depressing elevators..The rooms are done in a rustic theme which may have looked nice when first done, but now are just shabby looking...worn ragged slipcovers cover even worse furniture...just not what you expect from a 4 star property. They have made an attempt to upgrade the bathrooms, which would have been nice except for the mold in the shower. We went to the store and got cleaner for the shower...something you should not need to do for a 4 star room that was this expensive. The fireplace was a nice touch if the weather had warranted needing heat....One positive about the property is the restaurant...excellent food, ok service, and fantastic views....my recommendation is to stay elsewhere and come here for dinner....this is a 2 star property with 4 star prices.....<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118636561">We stayed at the Edgewater after our cruise to Alaska.

Musty, moldy, yuck. Seriously in need of an update. Frayed carpet, nicked and scuffed mouldings. And, if you must stay there, the railroad side rooms are pretty noisy, but the upgrade t the water side is a little ridiculous at $75. And, for at least part of your stay you'll be looking at the side of a giant cruis shipp, rather than the water. The concierge was never at the desk, so the front desk staff did the job.

Expensive restaurant and bar in the hotel. Food was good, service was as well, but expect to pay for it. The worst is $34 a night to park unless you want to leave your car out on the street a block away. I wouldn't, Seattle is full of homeless and others who might mess with your nice car.

Our first room smelled like cigarette smoke (it was a non-smoking room) so we had to move. The location is pretty good, next to the Olympic sculpture park and right on the water, but it is far from everything else you might want to do, including any restaurants within walking distance. The concierge was not friendly or helpful when I checked in or later when I asked him a question. Also, he sent us to the 3 top tourist trap restaurants in Seattle...so if you want authentic and where the locals eat, do not ask the concierge!

This was my first time staying Seattle and could not have asked for more. The Edgewater is a must for anyone wanting to stay within walking distance of the best sights while experiencing clean, comfortable accommodations and impeccable service. The staff were helpful, courteous, and eager to make my stay as worry-free as possible. Six Seven was fabulous - I highly recommend their breakfast and enjoying a cocktail later in the afternoon in the bar area. I can't comment on their dinner menu as I ate out each night. My room was great, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was gorgeous - impeccably clean with brand new appliances, stunning shower, and stone floor. There are trains that run by the hotel but they did not disturb me one bit. I didn't have to use them, but the hotel does provide earplugs in the room. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I am definitely staying there again the next time I'm in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117718792">Overall this is a nice hotel but it is never a good sign when you enter a room and there are complimentary ear plugs on the night stand! My room the first night was at the edge of the hotel closest to the train tracks. Even with the ear plugs you felt the trains rumble through the room constantly all night. To make matters worse, my room (#201) was right next to the room where the cleaning staff prepares their carts. So at 7 am they are talking loud and slamming the door. The next day I asked for a different room (I requested something on the water side but was told there was nothing - yet one of my colleagues got a free upgrade to the water front a few hours later). Since I was hear for business I did not have the option to go elsehwere. Otherwise it is a decent hotel. Decent food (though the web site claims Starbucks in the room yet it is some generic coffee). In my second room the coffee pot in the TV stand did not pull out and the cord which snaked through the back was too short to be able to pour water in the pot so I couldn't use it. Lovely views and staff were nice. The king bed I had was comfortable and the shower/bathroom is nice. I guess because they maybe use compact fluourescent bulbs it is very dim in the room (you know you can put more powerful lights in!). Concierge was helpful. Location is great.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117553302">After reading some of the comments for this hotel I was a little concerned. More so with the train noise as our room faced directly to the tracks. The room was very sound proof. There was some train noise but not enough to effect your sleep. The room was very clean and loved the decor. We took there limo service to the airport and upon checking thru security at the airport we realized my wife left here wallet in the limo.

We called the morning of the day we were arriving and the woman I spoke to said that we had connecting rooms on the reservation. I confirmed it as I checked in and the manager said that the rooms were close, but not connecting. We asked her to change it and she said that she did. When we got to our rooms, they actually were next door-but not connecting. I called the front desk and the same manager said that the type of rooms we had didn't have connecting rooms available, but she would check for us the next day-she never did. The customer service was very poor. We also found the hallway carpet very worn and didn't have a pleasant smell. Other than the common lobby area, the hotel is showing it's age and needs some updating.

It was a real treat to stay in the Beatle's Suite. Dinner was fantastic at Six Seven. Portions were on the smaller side in this "super-size" culture. Definitely sit outside!

BUT if you choose a waterside room (and why, except for the cost, you'd stay on the land side is a mystery) be sure to ask for a room far out on the water since otherwise you'll be looking in large part at an adjoining dock. As to the room itself, it's quite small though the bath and shower (no tub if it matters) are lovely.

The rustic decor is in need of an update, the amenities aren't all that impressive and 50% of the rooms have a view of the parking lot and nothing else. If you want a view of the water you can expect to pay literally hundreds of dollars or more. The 67 lounge, however, has great food and an incredible view of Elliott Bay. The chess set in the lobby is also a very nice touch (I'm always looking for hotel's that make chess boards available to their guests).

Only gripe - no pool, and I haven't found a gym yet.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115933273">My wife and I stayed at Edgewater Hotel for two nights. We chose the Edgewater because we were coming from Victoria on the Victoria Express ferry which arrives at berth 69, right next to the Edgewater at berth 67. So we wheeled our suitcases the short distance to the Edgewater. Location The hotel is not near stores or areas of interest. Probably the closest shopping area is Pike Place, about a 15-minute walk away. We soon realized the hotel was too remote for us. We had booked for Saturday through Tuesday nights, and we checked out on a Monday. They charged us half of the estimate for all four days. Sadly, if we had booked for only Saturday-Sunday (much cheaper weekend rates), then we would have wound up paying considerably less for those two days. The halls The long halls can be entered from only one side so you do a lot of walking if your room is far from the entrance. The long narrow corridors don't seem to fit with the premium rooms on the fourth floor. The halls are narrow enough so that it's difficult to navigate a suitcase past the maids' cleaning carts, and people who are sensitive to scents will feel the hall does not smell fresh. The sense of mustiness is enhanced by the hunting lodge motif and squeaking floorboards. Room We were in room 430 on the fourth floor. There is a sofa against the foot of the bed with cassock in front of it that could be used for a breakfast tray. There is an enormous plasma TV screen can be watched from the bed or sofa. In one corner a gas fireplace goes on if temperature controls changed suddenly from cold to hot. Good bathrobes, umbrella in closet. The bed is comfortable and inviting with lots of cushions and a little stuffed bear that we named "Ed" wearing the Edgewater T-shirt, propped against the pillows. The posts of the four poster bed are made of raw timber, probably for effect. There is a writing desk by the bed, and the floor is carpeted. There are more than enough electric plug outlets. We liked the location of the air conditioner/heater. It didn't blow on the bed or sofa. Good selection of teas with the tea and coffee maker. The refrigerator had a freezer compartment, so we could freeze our ice pack. Bathroom The wide bathroom with entry way takes up a quarter of the room-bathroom area. There is a stand-up shower. There is no more than one double hook to hang towels, bathrobes, etc., so we wound up putting them on back of the toilet even though hooks could have been installed in many places on the wall. View The view from the rooms on the fourth floor (see photo) is similar to that from Six Seven Restaurant, but the view is broader, including a view on clear days of Mt. Ranier hiding behind the red fingers of a container port crane. A porch runs the full length of the room with access through two sliding doors. We were in room 430, close to the Norwegian Cruise Line berth. NCL passengers could look down on our porch, taking away some privacy, but the cruise ships made a pretty view for us, and we missed them when there was no ship in the berth. The view from the fourth floor may be good for Seattle, but it is no match for the view at, say, the Pan Pacific Vancouver. Quiet enjoyment We could hear the couple in the room next to us banging suitcases around on Sunday morning, and about an hour later in the same room there was such a lot of commotion that I went into the hall to find the source, and I found it was the housekeeping lady. I have no idea what she was doing. There is a function room on the 4th floor by the elevators, and the decibels get pretty high during receptions. Itâ€™s best to avoid room 484. It is the guest room nearest to the fourth floor function room. They have a heavy door that can be closed against the pandemonium when guests are trying to sleep night. Service Service at check-in, check-out, housekeeping, and concierge was polite and efficient but not exceptional. Restaurants The restaurant Six Seven is so outstanding that we ate there twice. They provide half-plates, so instead of sharing, I had a halibut, and my wife had pork loin. Both were excellent. The desserts were tasty with distinguished presentations. I had a panna cotta with blueberry topping, and my wife had a lavender honey creme brulee with a glass of Red Mountain Kiona ice wine. It was an extraordinarily satisfying meal. We recommend Six Seven Restaurant whether you stay at the Edgewater or not. We had breakfast in the room, and the food was very good and delivered promptly. We ate in the room rather than on the porch under the gaze of cruise ship passengers. Internet Edgewater's unique Internet policy seems a bit grasping. If you want wi-fi (no LAN), you pay an additional $4 an hour, $10 a day, or $25 for three days which is annoying. If you are using two devices, such as a computer and a smart phone, the charge is doubled, and if you use three devices, the charge is tripled, which is annoying to the power of three. We were charged for using two devices in one day. We felt the hotel was good for a day, considering its view and location near the Victoria Clipper and cruise lines, but we prefer to be in the middle of shops and restaurants, and we felt a wee bit ravaged paying for Internet access on a per-device basis. We moved to the more central Pan Pacific Seattle Hotel where LAN and wi-fi are free for all guests. The hotel offers a lot, but the pluses and minuses divided by the price would yield an average value.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115925271">The suite we had was just OK for $ 500.00 per nite.

Wait staff in restaurant was rude and we had 2 middle age children with us and we asked about different options for them and her reply was " We don;t get many families here with children! so there are no other options."

New room is higher up so that was better relative to the parking lot, but I plugged in the iron and then realized after waiting for it to heat up that the electrical outlet was broken. While waiting for it to heat up I was brushing my teeth and noticed the drain was plugged in the bathroom so the sink filled up, lovely. Likely just bad luck on my part, but at that price I was paying for a Seattle hotel and the "best hotel in Seattle" moniker that gets thrown around, I expected a lot more. I won't be staying here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115556697">I stayed at The Edgewater with my two children, &amp; my wife for one week in early July. The accommodations were clean, yet the hallways were dark. There are no vending machines, (which I've come to take for granted for a late night snack). Although they boast of an excellent shuttle system that can get guests to &amp; from various Seattle locations, you must be OK with there schedule, &amp; be OK with receiving guilt in requesting the shuttle from some staff that answer the shuttle hotline. We enjoyed walking &amp; exploring downtown, so bring your sneakers and enjoy walking to your destinations. Also- pay the extra money and treat yourself to a water view room...Unless of course you LOVE listening &amp; seeing trains constantly go past your window. This was cool for our 6 year old, but the rest of us would have rather gazed out over the water. Also the bathroom was odd in that you felt very exposed with modern partial barriers. Btw- our son fell out of bed at 1:00am. When I asked the front desk what I should do with a child with a quickly swelling child's ear that was changing various colors, they responded with we can call an ambulance. Idk what I expected, maybe ice? Maybe an EMT on call? This is a nice hotel...but just enough quirks to make you question spending your hard earned money:(<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115496836">We spent 4 days at the Edgwater for a conference. Booked a waterfront room, (well worth it.) An older property but very clean and comfortable. Fireplace in the room provided heat but it was an on or off situation. I still liked it. Bed and pillows great. Ate both at the restaurant and had conference meals, top notch all the way. Staff was really excellent, never met a person who didn't smile and acknowledge me.

Our ground floor waterfront room had a balcony right over the water. We sat out on the deck chairs and enjoyed the view and the ferry that went by like clockwork. It was like being on a boat. Beautiful lobby with floor to ceiling windows and comfortable chairs for a relaxing view. We utilized the in-room fireplace (the switch is located in the bathroom under the vanity). The room was pricy but unique. The hotel is right next to the pier that the ferry to Victoria uses, so it was very conveniently located for that leg of our trip.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115092295">I called this place to make reservation because I wanted to book a oceanview room to watch fireworks from our room!! So kids would enjoy and would not be stuck in traffic for hours after fireworks!! The lady assured me I could see fireworks from that room. Once I got there checked in and they told me I can't see fireworks from that room but they will give is free shuttle to space needle but we will have to take taxi back cuz thru don't have shuttle after 10. Space needle didn't even have fireworks this year!!! I paid $350 a night for the room and got yo see nothing and I was gone most of the evening somewhere else!!

Service was quite good but hassle them for free Internet.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115068943">Don't stay at this hotel if you want above average (let alone outstanding) service. Pros: Stayed in a executive suite. Decor is ok, had this wood cabin thing going on. Bed is comfortable and the view on the waterfront is beautiful as the room had 3 sliding doors with a balcony that ran the length of the room. Location of the hotel is great as it is close to a lot of the sights in Seattle. If not within walking distance, the cab fare is pretty low. Cons: The A/C in the room is not sufficient to cool down the room. The room was steaming hot when we got there and the cleaning service was constantly turning it up after we would turn it down. The service was average. No one went out of their way to accommodate special needs or ask if we needed anything. Food was lousy. Room service sucked. Asked to have breakfast served 15 minutes earlier than normal due to an early cruise departure and was told no. Over-all - It would not be my first choice to stay again on a family vacation. Maybe business, but when I am on vacation, I want to relax and service expectations are much higher.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115053902">In all fairness, this was the third of July and the hotel appeared very busy but we experienced an unfriendly front desk clerk who could not give our family two rooms next to one and other. Okay, fair enough. But the unforgivable problem was that the hotel did not have any double rooms left and gave us only a room with ONE small double bed to use for three teenagers! They could not allow a rollaway so one child slept on the floor and two shared the small bed. Being July, that evening things got warm and stuffy but the hotel has no air-conditioning so we opened the window. Problem is that the freight train line is right out the window and they run all night....loud horns! Finally, the kids had hot water but our shower did not get above Luke warm, uhg. This is a four star hotel, $34 a day parking, luxury spa products, they problems we experienced were unforgivable in my mind. Admittedly, we had one bad experience followed by another but I can see that if you had a room of adequate size and oceanfront you could have a lovely evening. The hotels common areas are fresh and relaxing. Sad to have had such an unpleasant experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115034548">Finally a hotel that gets it right!

We chose a water view room with the king bed. We had only been to Seattle one time previously; on our Honeymoon 18 years ago. When we chose the Edgewater we did so due to its close proximity to the Bell Harbor Marina since we were meeting my father there to join his for a few days of sailing. So when we arrived to the Edgewater we were impressed with the great service and relaxing dÃ©cor. Our room was clean, beautiful, and had an outstanding view of Puget Sound AND a great view of part of the city. Yes the room was a little more expensive than some others around Seattle, but it was worth it for several reasons; cleanliness, service, comfort, dÃ©cor, and location. We really enjoyed our stay at the Edgewater and we will stay there next time we go to Seattle, we highly recommend the Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115004847">We loved the Edgewater.

We have stayed at some very high end hotels in the Seattle area. We feel that it's room prices and star rating are a little overboard. The room was SO tiny (but clean). We could barely move. The bathroom even smaller with no tub (also clean). We made due. We did love the restaruant and bar. It was also nice to walk about the pier, even though it was quite a distance to any place worth going to. The staff overall was very helpful and friendly. It did not help that our room was near the elevator/party room - a lot of noise. In general, if you want to be on the water and downtown, not a bad option IF you can get a great deal OR you don't mind a super small room for a really big price. We could almost love this hotel just because of it's location, restaurant and bar - just wished the prices reflected a little better for what you actually get.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114915229">Do not pass up the Edgewater.

Some of the room are a stone's throw away from the track. So if you want a room that doesn't face a train line, you have to pay a huge premium for a "waterfront" room. The hotel is looking worn and run-down.. carpeting ragged, some of the outlets in the room partially coming out of the wall, marks on the wall. For the price, this should be a Ritz Carlton and it's more like a (unrenovated) Holiday Inn. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114788992">A great location and can be a great view. The hotel could use some carpet updating but the furniture in the rooms is exceptional (very comfortable king size bed). We loved sitting out on the balcony overlooking the water until Friday when the cruise ship docked, so when you check in you may want to make sure there are no cruise ships scheduled into port. We were leaving Friday so it wasn't too bad! I would definitely reccommed the Edgewater but try and book your room as close to the check in area for the best view.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114753839">On checking in I was advised by the receptionist that no upgrades were available as the hotel was full, even though I had not mentioned anything about an upgrade. No problem, I thought as we had booked and paid 3 months in advance and should have a reasonable room. Why would we need an upgrade. On entering our City View 4th floor room we were taken back by its very small size and Queen size bed. With our luggage in the room we barely had room to open the suitcases without having to step over them. Then I saw the complementary single set of ear plugs (were they mine, or my wifes) on the table and I knew we were in trouble. I now understood why the receptionist got in early telling me not to bother asking for an upgrade. Sure enough, within minutes a train rumbled past outside our window. No problem, with the window shut you could still hear it but not too loudly. However, the room was very hot and smelly, so trying to sleep with the window shut proved to be impossible, so on with the airconditioner. Well, that was not such a good idea as the thermostat controlled fan kicks in every few minutes with the roar, reverberation and vibration of a farm tractor ploughing, and the room still was too hot to be comfortable. A bit of checking and we found the gas fireplace in the corner was still burning and putting out a considerable amount of heat, even though it was switched off on the wall. By this time it was past midnight and we were yet to get any sleep, so a call to the front desk resulted in the night manager arriving and after partially dismantling the heater he was able to extinguish the flame. At last the aircon was able to cool the room to the point where we were able to sleep with the heavy doona replaced by a light blanket. The two nights we spent at this hotel in what must be the smallest room in the place at $255-00 a night were, we feel, the worst value for money of the 20 or so hotels we stayed in during our 2 month trip to North America. Prior to this hotel we stayed one night in Hotel 1000 on 1St Av in Seattle, about 10 blocks from the Edgewater, and we paid $215-00 for a City View basic room which was two to three times larger with a beautiful bathroom and excellent, modern facilities. The Edgewater has good location on the waterfront, but absolutely nothing else. It is a very old, dark, dank, dimly lit, depressing dungeon. The walls are paper thin and you will be awoken by your neighbours bathroom visits during the night. The restaraunt is expensive with very average food, the lobby decor is weird, to say the least, and appears to be a collection of odds and ends from a number of recycle shops. There were at least 7 different styles of chairs in the lobby area alone when we were there in June, 2011. And the deer antlers looked at home in Alaska, but don't quite work in a so called 4 or 5 star hotel in downtown Seattle. Other reviewers have praised this hotel, and I am unable to understand how they can. Obviously they were not in the same 4th floor room as we were. On looking into rooms on the first three floors that were being cleaned next morning I could see that they are larger than the fourth floor, so if you do stay here you should specify any floor but the fourth. Yes, the location on the waterfront is nice, but we did not feel this one factor compensated for all the negative features of the hotel and should we visit Seattle again we most definitely will not be staying at the Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114689524">Worst mattress ever.

You can walk the water front, walk to Pike Street Market, and the fantastic water front sculpture garden just to the north. The hotel has a nice public area and a bar that have great views. The downside is that the hotel is a serious need of renovation. Everything seems beat-up with dirty hallway carpets and the like. I was taken aback by all this when we checked in and felt mostly like I was staying in a dump the three nights I was there. The standard rooms are very small, the ones on the eastside ("City View") get train noise from the tracks that are a couple hundred yards away, there is no place to park other than valet which ends up costing an additional $40+ a day, and there is no free Wi-Fi. If I had not gotten the booking via Hot Wire for fairly cheap, I would have been very, very unhappy.

The room was very large. We didn't get a waterfront view, but had a nice view of the space needle from our room. The workout facility in the hotel is pretty good. Their room amenities guidebook is not very complete, so make sure you ask about charges, and ask about their facility services.

We had a water-side suite for my family of 5 and could not have been more thrilled with everything the hotel had to offer us. The view was breathtaking and it was such a great way to experience Seattle, which is a wonderful port town. The location was perfect for us - walking distance to Pike's Place Market, Bell Town restraunts and bars and on a free bus line to Pioneer square. We did not rent a car and never felt we needed one as the public transportation was very accessible. The hotel dining was wonderful as was the hotel bar, which had live music and fabulous views.

It sounded enchanting--'The only waterfront hotel in Seattle'--which is apparently true. I found all of the staff to be very friendly and welcoming, and the hotel has a charming 'northwestern rustic' atmosphere, decor, and room furnishings. Here's where things fell apart: I received e-mailed confirmation, yes confirmation, of my reservation for initially two rooms--one standard waterfront room and one 'city family suite'. Both were expensive by my standards (and budget) at the upper two hundred dollar per night level. I was entertaining three friends, plus myself, and decided that the suite alone would offer sufficient sleeping space, since it has two double beds, plus a queen-sized sofa bed. I then cancelled the smaller 'waterfront' room by phone and received e-mail confirmation. I will say that all of my e-mail confirmations were prompt and inviting. I will also say that the staff were generally friendly and did their best under circumstances that were sometimes beyond their control. This was especially true of the night front desk and front door staff, who made every effort to be gracious and as accommodating as the situation allowed. However, when we arrived shortly after midnight the first night, we were told, in a perfunctory manner, that our suite was no longer available (no explanation, except to say that our nightly rate was reduced by $100) and were summarily, the FOUR of us (and NONE of us four men normally sleep together), put into a room with only TWO double beds. They then provided a TWIN-sized rollaway bed, which was quite bulky and REALLY crowded this significantly smaller room than had been confirmed originally. Again, this was in the middle of the night when were tired from traveling, and caused considerable consternation and stress among the four of us. I finally went back to the front desk (a LONG walk BTW), and asked if they had any additional rooms. The night clerk said they had one left, a small room with one queen bed, which I slept in for the night. The next day, I spoke with the first of two managers on duty. She herself admitted not knowing why were denied our original suite and seemed truly dumfounded that this had happened at all. Then she agreed to not charge us 'anything' for the first night. This was later retracted by the both managers, who then charged us for the double-bed room. The next afternoon, we were finally moved into the suite, which met our sleeping requirements, and were quoted a set discounted price for all four nights. However, when I received my final bill, the price was changed, upwardly and significantly, night-by-night. The clerk on duty seemed confused by the complexities of the bill, and the second manager from the day before, was on the phone. According to my calculations, we were overcharged by approximately $ 105.00, including a movie charge that the very friendly but somewhat confused clerk did research and told me was an error. The movie charge was taken off (thank you), but rather than continue to haggle, for the 4th or 5th time with one of the managers, I decided to try to work things out, via e-mail, with Mr. David Cocks, the General Manager. While this hotel certainly offers terrific harbor views, from both its lobby and its restaurant and bar areas (and also has rooms that face the water, which we didn't have), I must say, with sincere regret, that the booking and billing hassles that I experienced definitely do NOT justify the high prices, nor the waterfront location. Though uniquely positioned on the harbor, there are also several other hotels just one street from the waterfront as well, and the harborfront, several miles of it, is easily accessible on foot from any of them. I had also hoped to bring professional associations here from conferences. I am with Mensa and several healthcare professional organizations.

I would have liked to try the restaurant the food sounded fantastic and again what a view. Next time! We had a small problem with the fireplace, but the engineer came right away to fix it and we enjoyed sitting by the fire and seeing the space needle.

My husband and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary -- we had a 3rd floor waterfront room next to a boardroom. Fri and Sat nights weddings were held at the establishment and they have music going until midnight (3AM EST). Fri night it was kind of funny -- "Oh, Honey, it's like we are in college again... hear that bass, is that YMCA again? ha ha" but still a bit annoying so I called down to front desk to see if there would be another wedding on Sat, planning to move rooms if that was the case. I was assured by a bored male voice that there were no more weddings for the weekend and none Sat night. And then BAM -- even louder music (like a G6 anyone?) -- even my husband (easiest going person on the planet) was annoyed. For some reason also there were people going in and out of the boardroom late at night too. I called down Sat and got earplugs but you could still feel the thumping and alas sleep came well after midnight with us up about 4 hours later to travel the next day. My husband had a conference in Denver the week before and got stuck at an Econo Lodge before the Ritz (true dichotomy there) -- anyway he said the noise at the Edgewater especially Sat was louder than the Econo Lodge where his neighbor had left empty bottles of 40oz colt 45 outside his door. The noise was not so classy and not for a hotel that markets itself as a romantic weekend getaway. I am all for weddings and I am also all for adequately soundproofing in hotels that charge a good amount per night and market themselves as a luxury hotel. We mentioned our dissatisfaction at checkout and were told we'd get all of our parking reimbursed (about $180 or so) and then we were told we'd just get $100. My husband and I hate public scenes so we were not going to argue at the front desk in front of everyone BUT while I appreciate the effort and I'm glad they tried I think this was inadequate. After we got home I did call and leave a message with the manager so they would know why I'm leaving a negative review. PROS: 1. location, location, location-- loved the waterfront.... you will hear the Victoria Clipper leave early in AM (7ish or 7:30) if you leave your window open at night 2. fairly comfortable beds and pillows 3. clean rooms 4. well updated bathrooms w/ clawfoot tub and retractable doors that open to bedroom and waterview 5. nice gas fireplace but all heat recirculates to room -- no "just for ambiance" AMBIVALENT -- none of this counted for or against the hotel just some insights ... 1. gym -- not good, not bad -- you've got good selection of free weights w/ 2 adjustable back and seat benches, 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, stationary bike (I think everything was matrix brand) -- 2 sets of weights on pulley systems w/ bar attached at top for pull-ups, etc 2. the restaurant -- just so-so -- we were told by staff that breakfast is a must so we started there -- my husband w/ smoked salmon platter (hard to screw that up -- smoked salmon, bagel, porcini cream cheese, capers...) and he loved it as he always loves smoked salmon, I had the smoked salmon omlette and I'd give it a 4/10 -- we did not go back as there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance 3. no coffee makers in room -- some other travelers from other hotels had complimentary coffee makers in rooms and we would see them get beans freshly ground at some coffee shops and we were jealous -- would have been a nice touch 4. restaurant brews starbucks -- I like starbucks but I can get it anywhere -- I thought it would have been nice if they had beans from smaller local roasters but again that's just a personal opinion so I did not count it in review 5. concierge was nice but not terribly helpful for more adventurous activities -- we found everything we loved on trip advisor, yelp, etc. 6. you can hear surrounding rooms tubs/showers -- not a huge deal but just be aware 7. for energy conservation their default is they only change sheets every 3 nights -- if you want more frequently you have to call the front desk -- again not a big deal but if you are taking midday naps in sunscreen due to being up late the night before because of noise you may want new sheets CONS 1. NOISE, NOISE, NOISE -- in my mind a hotel fails if you can't sleep there when you want to sleep 2. expensive parking -- to get around this we learned later there is a parking garage directly across the street that charges $21 a day (entrance directly off wall street) -- the garage is open I think 8-11 and there is a $40 charge if you need to get your car out after hours but if the hours work for you this is a lot less than the $36/day valet mandatory lot w/ all the valet tips at the hotel 3. as with anywhere some staff were just rude but you could avoid them In summary I think there are probably better hotels for the money in the area. However, if you are going to be there midweek you may be able to enjoy a great location without intrusive noise. ***see review of Western Prince Whale Tours -- AWESOME!!! -- best day ever -- we chartered a flight w/ Westwind aviation (a package deal w/ Western Prince) to San Juan Islands, Friday Harbor and then went out on the Zodiac -- can't recommend highly enough -- the entire day was smooth, seamless and AWESOME!! -- it made our anniversary vacation exceptional<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR109224357">So, as we drove up to the hotel for our first stay at the Edgewater we were very impressed with the views of the water. The valet staff for the most part were very helpful, though the cost of valet was a little much. Checking in was really easy and the staff were very pleasant. The lobby overlooks the water and is a beautiful place to relax and watch the boats go by. The hotel is centrally located and is very close to great restaurants and bars in the area. Our room was located on the city side and we found that the trains running out side the hotel became a noisy with the sliding door open at night. I'm a hot sleeper and usually need some cold air circulation. So I closed the door and turned on the A/C unfortunately the A/C unit was so loud we had to turn it off. This was a real annoyance for the both of us for the rest of the trip. We would have asked for another room but our stay was only 2 nights and the hassle wasn't worth it. We expected of all things the A/C to run well in such an acclaimed expensive hotel. We stopped by the hotel restaurant twice on our trip. The first night we stopped by around 11pm for a nightcap and were pleasantly surprised to hear a great band playing covers which we really enjoyed. The service was great and the restaurant was very stylish and comfortable. Our second restaurant visit was not as good as our first. We went by around 4pm the following day for a snack after a long day of sightseeing. We ordered a starter off of the bar menu and when it arrived it had an item in it that neither myself or my partner consume in our diets. I'm pretty diligent about reading menu ingredients because of my diet limitations. Any how when I told our server about the extra item she gave us a disgusted look, whisked away our plate and threw it in the garbage. Our first instinct was that we had made a mistake and read the menu incorrectly, so I borrowed our neighbors menu to confirm my suspicion and indeed we were correct. No word of the item in the ingredient list. I tried to get her attention again soon after to tell her that the ingredient was not listed on the menu and when I did she told me I was wrong without looking at the menu. Our newly made appy arrived and looked great though our server did not bring us new cutlery, which we also thought was odd as the previous ones were already soiled. My girlfriend had to go to the bar to get it. Basically I was thoroughly disappointed with that restaurant visit. The last thing you want on a romantic weekend is a disgruntled server to ruin the mood. Another gripe is that there wasn't even free wireless in the lobby which is really not good in this day and age,though they did have a business center where you could use the internet. All in all the hotel is very pretty though needs some revamping. Great area, great views, very nice helpful front counter and bell staff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR109103516">We stayed at the Edgewater for w weekend trip into the city. Loved the bar/restaurant so much, the views of the sun setting over the water were incredible. Had two delicious pineapple drinks which were amazing. Room was somewhat small but i feel like it made the experience cozier. The Shower and the bathroom was very nice, clean. Service was good but nothing to write home about. Valet parking was kind of annoying. We didn't have a "water" view but I did not mind. Overall I would suggest staying here for the experience but I would not recommend stay for more then a couple days.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108871739">I've read a lot of the negative reviews and I don't get it. We were on the city side, with a view of the parking lot and the noise of the trains, but none of that mattered. We barely heard the trains, and we definitely didn't sit around staring out the window. We easily walked to the Space Needle, Pike Place, even Safeco field. The view from the restaurant and the lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are so cozy. And although the parking was a little expensive, the service was exemplary; the valets, doormen, front desk, servers, housekeepers, were all great. We'll definitely come back!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108752710">My Wife and I were very lucky to stay here two nights as they accepted our bid on Priceline's Name Your Own Price and except for a few minor complaints really enjoyed it. We had a room facing the city but really it wasn't all bad as we had a great view of the space needle hovering just above the landscape. The room was a little small and there wasn't a lot of room for our 2 large and 2 medium suitcases but other than that it was cozy. My biggest complaint was the valet manager giving me an attitude when we arrived and I told him I wasn't going to valet and I wanted to leave my car there for just a few minutes to check in. DON'T GET FOOLED INTO PAYING THE RIDICULOUS VALET FEES! There is plenty of parking out on the streets and the meters are free from 6pm-8am. For one night we parked in a garage off of Vine and Elliott and it was only $17 for 24 hours. Other than that, all staff I met were very friendly. Pike Place and the space needle were really short walks away and we really enjoyed our stay! If you have time, drive up and do the Boeing tour in Everett, it is awesome!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR108650803">Completely dissappointed when we were told that this was a 4 star hotel, when it is really a 3. Service from start to finish was the worst I've ever seen except for David the bell-man, the youngest and most hard working of the entire crew. The valet manager (I believe) was a snot and argued with my wife in front of a group of guests calling her a liar. The room was cute, but the fireplace (heater) doesn't ever turn fully off and we had to keep the window open for ventilation. The fresh air was nice, but the trains and traffic didn't allow us to sleep. Back to the terrible service...at breakfast in 6 7, the waitress was friendly and the food was pretty good, however the restaurant or bar manager decided to call our waitress incompetent and say, "unbelievable, unbelievable!" as he shook his head and walked away. From our point of view she didn't even do anything wrong. Overall I'd have to say that there was nothing about this hotel that we enjoyed. It was one of the worst overall experiences we've ever had and I wouldn't stay there ever again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108489327">We were very impressed by the service that we received first of all. We were traveling with a soon to be 2 yr old, as you imagine that wasn't the easiest. The staffs were more then welcoming and accommodating, they went extra and beyond to make sure that we had a pleasant stay, which we did! Although we booked out room through priceline.com, they did not give us the dirty look and suggested us an upgrade. It was well worth the money to upgrade to the premium room with the ocean view. It was absolutely beautiful! They even double checked the schedule for us to make sure that we were ok with the noise from the event, and gave us option to another room (which the noise didnt bother us nor the baby). The hotel and rooms were nicely decorated. I understand rustic chic is not for everyone, but with 2 designers in the room, I can only say that we were impressed. You simply cannot beat the location, the view and the quality. It was a short 15 mins stroll along the water to Pike Place and Space Needle (with a stroller). They even offer courtesy shuttle to any downtown area. We did take advantage of it for a few times, because going downtown meant uphill to us. Then we simply strolled down the hill when we were done with our shopping and lunch. Parking was pricey at the hotel, but it was not hard to find off street parking to us at all. We were able to find off street parking right outside the hotel after 6pm for both nights that we have a rental. Though we wish the internet was free, because we needed that to plan the next day, we were very surprised by the amazing value and quality of their happy hour menu and in room service menu as well. With a gorgeous ocean view, what better to rest our feet with some local mussels, fish and chips and a beer. At our last morning, we just simply ordered some b'fast, and enjoyed in our room before we head out to the airport. Thank you Edgewater! We are not hesitate to recommend you to our friends and families. And we hope to see you real soon.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR108485624">My daughter and I were in town for strictly a girls fun trip and picked the Edgewater because of it's location. We had a waterfront room and enjoyed the spectacular view that you get being right on the water. We used the shuttle one day that leaves the hotel on the hour. The bar was a little noisy but food was good and waitress very nice. Overall we were very pleased with our stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR107952950">I just can't feel as enthusiastic about this iconic hotel. The location can't be beat, if you're lucky enough to have a water view. But the rooms, mountain lodge style, are extremely dark if the sun isn't shining. This IS Seattle. The bathroom, also small, had no towel bars, the closet was a 2' bar, and there was a very old 19" TV. Have stayed here before and other rooms (facing the water) are better, but we will stay somewhere else next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR107743658">This reservation was a $79/night Priceline win, which I increased from 2 nights to 3 after realizing we needed more time in Seattle. I quickly emailed reservations requesting a full water view room with double beds for my daughter and myself. An employee who I found out is now an ex-employee corresponded with me but never did respond to my request for a specific room. Unfortunately, the first night they did not have the double room I requested, so we had to settle for a king on the 2nd floor (246 I believe, which had a slight view of the pier next door). It was a small room with a good-sized bathroom. Because of the reservation mix-up, I requested some sort of comp and received 3 days of free Internet, rather than having to pay $25. This was satisfactory. Still, I had to pay an additional $60/night plus tax in order to have a full water view room, which sounds steep, but I really enjoyed the views so thought the expense worth it. We stayed in room 360 for 2 nights, which had a bit larger living space but much smaller bathroom. They need more hooks to hang towels in the bathrooms. The tile on the walls in the shower is great, but not so great on the floor. The rooms were clean, and we used the fireplace the first night a few minutes at a time, which heated up the room quickly. Never did try the fireplace on the third floor, as the weather warmed up. After hours of walking one day, I ended up back in the room, glass of wine in hand, feet up on the bear footrest, gazing out at the glistening water watching boats, ferries, and gulls. It was great! Iâ€™ve read reviews that the walls are thin but I have no complaints. Yes, I heard showers in the mornings and the cleaning staff in the halls. However, we slept very well. All employees were friendly, and the reservation staff tried their best to accommodate us when looking for a suitable room. We ate at the Six-Seven Restaurant one night and used room service another evening. Expensive but very tasty food. OK, we splurgedâ€¦.it was Motherâ€™s Day weekend after all! One other thing, be sure to carefully check your bill. I questioned a $79 fee that was shown for two nights â€“ this turned out to be the Priceline fee which I had already paid. I would return, but only using Pricelineâ€™s â€œName Your Own Price,â€� as the rack rate is way out of our price range.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR107234555">I am currently at the hotel. This is my third day here. The location is great but the rooms are small. The staff leaves a lot to be desired for. I have had bad experiences at every level. The front desk people are unfriendly and rude. They do not have a true "Concierge". In fact, the people that are at that location are the least helpful in the hotel. Since this is my first time to Seattle, I do not know what the other hotels are like but this one, I would never and i mean never stay at again. Parking is Valet parking only. I was definitely hoping for a much better experience. Too bad that I have three more nights here with a non-refundable reservation. The Runner, Georgia May 2011<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR106594618">I stayed at the Edgewater hotel in Seattle recently. I had a south-facing room with a fantastic view of Elliott Bay. It's a charming hotel with a rustic feel and it's really neat that the Beatles stayed there all those years ago. Initially, I was impressed with the rustic feel of my room; it had a high ceiling and a clever wooden entertainment center that included a refrigerator and several drawers for storage. Curiously, there was also a mirror, roughly 6-feet high by 3-feet wide; it reminded me of the "mirror of desire" in the first Harry Potter movie. The room had a gas fireplace and two leather chairs nearby with a footstool that looked like a lamb. After about an hour of getting settled, checking email, and glancing out the window at jumping seals, diving seagulls, and on-time ferryboats, I noticed that the room was drafty. The draft came from a sliding window that wouldn't close properly. When I turned on the gas fireplace, it took only a minute or two to realize that the fireplace had a foul, fuel-like odor when operated. This is when the charm wore off. It's clear that the hotel has been remodeled and some of the enhancements are nice. However, much like the other hotels in the area it's not worth the inflated price. I stayed there on a slightly discounted conference rate, yet after standard fees, room tax, and a $10 Internet fee, I paid over $220. Others may disagree, but these days this is a lot for a hotel room (especially off-season). Regarding the city of Seattle, I had a few free hours to explore and I discovered that I like the city. However, like most North American big cities, it's expensive. Gas prices are over $4.00 per gallon, on-street parking is $4.00 per hour, and one of the main tourist attractions, Pike's Market, is less than a block away from a strip club. Such an establishment has a right to operate, however, I think it's bad business for the city of Seattle to allow that type of business near a major tourist attraction. Other big cities with tourist centers have dealt successfully with this problem (e.g., Boston comes to mind). I'm sure that many embarrassed parents have had to fib -- awkwardly -- to their old-enough-to-read kids about the kind of dancing that happens in the club. Overall, the Edgewater is not a bad hotel and the staff members that I dealt with were very nice and helpful. However, it â€“ like many things these days â€“ isnâ€™t worth the price. Just my two cents.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR106541757">To be fair, most of the downtown hotels in Seattle are overpriced (IMHO). Being right on the water, I was prepared to pay. However, I think the $34/day for parking is excessive. There is a fee for wifi; in nicer hotels, I think it should be included. The restaurant was good, but expensive; you pay for the view. The upside is that the staff was friendly and accommodating - they get high marks. If you order room service, check the fine print; a tip is already calculated into your charge. I *would* recommend the Edgewater, but with the caveat that it is not for cheap people.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR106525176">As it was our honeymoon, we backed our bed up against the window, flopped down on our stomachs like little kids and watched the Seattle waterfront and sunset slowly fade into evening...Nothing beats opening the windows and hearing the water lap at the pilings under the hotel and the cool breeze gently whistling by while your feet are warmed by the in-room fireplace. This is a definite anniversary return for additional lifelong-memories.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR105621287">The Edgewater was a recommendation by my travel agent, and as it turns out a great one. I was initially disappointed that there was no complementary shuttle from the airport, however, discovering that a luxury towncar would drive us for $35(USD) I decided a shuttle would not be required. Upon arrival the friendly staff were quick to open doors and carry bags. Check in was very quick and the front desk extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel staff were eager to point out attractions to walk to, attractions worth driving to, and places that were a must see such as the market at Pike Place.

We have booked hotels online before but never know what to expect. This one exceeded our expectations--Upon check-in, the staff upgraded us to a king bed with a balcony at no extra charge. The rooms were very nice and the bathroom was spectacular. The bed was super comfy and the fireplace was a great addition to a romantic getaway in the city! The hotel location was perfect--a couple blocks from Pike Place, about 5 blocks from downtown shopping and right on the water! The staff was friendly and polite and the dining room is amazing.

I loved the location, the rustic feel to the lobby and the views; A nice change of scenery from my East Coast stomping grounds. My room was clean and charming, alebit a bit dated and I didn't really understand the Teddy Bear thing until I asked-- at first I thought a serial killer loomed behind the bathroom door! Service was also excellent. Concierge assisted with a few different requests and the people were very friendly. My only real complaint relates to value. My room was roughly $300 with breakfast and tax, which is a hefty price by most standards. I asked for a King and instead received 2 doubles with a "partial view." Described as an upgrade, it was really a view of the loading dock next door. Cramped and not the top of the line, which I noticed peering into other rooms the next morning during housekeeping. For $300, I had hoped for more. My recommendation is to either do a bit better with the pricing or ask for one of the cream of the crop rooms. That said, I highly recommend the restaurant for breakfast - probably the best "hotel" breakfast I've ever had anywhere, hands down.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR104836495">Great staff, great service!

If that's the case, I can't imagine how bad other hotels must be. When we arrived, the front desk couldn't find our reservation. I provided a print out of our confirmation and it still took an additional ten minutes for the clerk to find our reservation on their system - not an auspicious start for exhausted travelers. When we arrived in our waterfront room our disappointment only deepened. The room was the smallest I've ever seen in a quality hotel. Although the kitschy decor was cute, the bed was so uncomfortable that I woke up with horrible back pain both mornings of our stay. I'd like to say that, at least, the room was clean, but the numerous, huge splotches of dried toothpaste on the inside of the bathroom door prevents me from doing so. The room service meal was reasonably tasty even though they "substituted" a sandwich for the salad that was ordered. I could go on with this parade of horribles, but I'd prefer to purge the memory of this hotel. Let it suffice to say that you couldn't pay me to stay here again. I'm told that there a many fine hotels in Seattle; do yourself a favor and stay at one of those, instead.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR102111264">I really enjoyed my stay.

What is not so great is the $30 valet fee and the rooms at the Edegewater. The lobby and restaurant are nice but as soon as you step into the elevator it is a great indicator for a feel of the rest of the hotel. As I stepped into the elevator it had the smell of an old casino, there are a lot of scuff marks and the carpet was just dirty. As we walked down the hall towards our room it was pretty much the same feel. We had upgraded to the waterside of the hotel, since coming in the view was just gorgeous so once we walked into our room I was pretty disappointed by the quality of the room. The only modern and nice part of our room was the bathroom at most. We were told that it would definitely be a lot quieter being on the waterside but it wasnâ€™t. We always heard the constant noise of the trains running by and the boats sounding off their horns. I never had a decent nightâ€™s sleep and also found the bed and pillows uncomfortable. At the end of it, I was a bit shocked by the total amount that we paid to stay here verses the quality we received. I would have to say that if you are willing to pay the prices to stay here, look around for a more modern and nicer hotel. It is definitely not worth the price to stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR98596927">I did Travelocity Secret Hotel and got a killer deal on this hotel. Based on reviews, I was expecting the smallest room on the ground floor city side. We were supposed to have a queen room - that's all. When we checked in, I asked if there was any way to get a Water View above the first floor and my wish was granted with an upgrade to a King with no extra charge! This is an older hotel, so the sliding door had some "air leakage", but the temperature was maintained between the automatic system and the fireplace. 4 big fluffy pillows, and extra leaning pillows. The decor is definitely Pacific NW, so some may think it's a bit "hoaky", but it's really quaint. Your foot rest by the fireplace is a big bear! Fun! Front Desk and Parking staff were very accomodating. They offer late check out at no charge which was wonderful. Walking to Pikes, Space Needle and Pioneer 'Square all easy distances.

It has been afew years since we have stayed, but have been to many weddings and receptions. As a retired couple we go to Seattle about once a month, and usually enjoy the excellent service and location of The Roosevelt Hotel. We decided to try The Edgewater again as we had enjoyed our stays in the past. Regretably, we will not be returning , or be able to recommend the hotel to family &amp; friends. Upon checking in we were assigned a Cityview Deluxe Room, which we had reserved. However, we didn't realize we had one of three of the worst rooms due to the proximity of the railroad tracks. Upon hearing a train every 5-10 minutes I saw the complimentary earplugs on the fireplace and knew we were in for a long night. My fears became reality as I wore the ear plugs, and still didn't get any sleep due to the crossing sounds and never ending trains. Waking up extrememly tired I made coffee and turned one of the mugs over to use to find it dirty with particles of food stuck to the sides,,(I have pictures of the mug), upon seeing that disgusting mug it made me question the cleanliness of the entire room, decided to forget the coffee. As it was chilly we tryed for two hours to get the fireplace working, which had worked the previous night, to no avail. The pilot light was on, but the fireplace would not come on manually or using the thermostat. For a Hotel of high reputation we were sadly disappointed at our experience this time at The Edgewater. Since we are retired, we travel extensively and expect more from a 5 Star Hotel. Also, our bill which was delivered to the room was wrong, however, the front desk attendant remedied that at check-out. Leaving frustrated and tired we probably will not be returning when we have enjoyed so many other properties with no issues.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR97042468">Nice place!

Beautiful, warm and cozy pacific northwest lodge style decor. Great location for Seattle sightseeing. Stayed in a Waterview Junior Suite on the top floor. View was awesome, could see downtown in one direction and across the Puget Sound to the Snow capped mountains the other direction. Ate lunch in the 6/7 restaurant on site. Food was terrific and so was the view. Husband loved the Fish and Chips and I had the house special mac and cheese with chicken added - yummy! The 6/7 bar also has a very nice Happy Hour from 3 to 6. Took a 10 minute walk to the Pike Place Market to roam. Concerning issues from other reviews: did not find noise from other rooms to be any issue, open walk in shower was a delight and did not get water all over the floor, yes it is an older hotel and the hallways look a little worn - but the view and location more than made up for it. We are for sure planning to return here on out next Settle visit. Tip: In the off season be sure to ask for a deal on the room you want.

Even so, the staff treated us very well and the woman at the desk even upgraded us to a King Bed for free since we were staying more than one night. My favourite part was the fireplace in our room. It was so nice after the chilly days we spent in Seattle. I would not stay in this hotel if I was staying by myself (as a woman) as returning to the hotel at night in the winter is a bit isolated. It isn't far from downtown or the space needle but it is far enough that I would not feel safe. The staff are super super nice. The hotel itself has cute aspects but some parts appear to have passed their glory days. The lobby is lovely. Our room was much better than expected for 60.00 CAD per night. The hallways were tired. Our door keys didn`t work well at all and the fixtures and details are showing their age. One other very uncool aspect of this hotel is that I did not see any evidence of anything eco about this hotel. I didn`t even see the little sign that says to hang your towels up if you don`t want them to change them. There was no recycling bins that I saw.

First, the photos do not correctly display the TACKY decor of the rooms. We also found the hotel to be dirty and the carpeting needs to be changed throughout the hotel. There were many places where the carpet was frayed and torn. The website refers to this hotel as a 4 star?????!!!! Are they serious????? It scares me to think of what a 3 star hotel would be in Seattle! This hotel is also not convenient to downtown. The website states that the hotel is in the heart of downtown Seattle.......another false advertisement. It is actually not in the best of areas. Don't let the website fool you into thinking that you will be near Pike's Market or other amenities in the downtown Seattle area! It is quite the walk! And not necessarily in the safest of walking areas! You will need to take a cab many times......oh, I forgot! They do have a shuttle service every hour, but make sure that you get there early.......it is a "first come, first serve basis!!!!!" When the shuttle is full then you have to wait another hour!!! My mother and I had to get a cab (one of many from this hotel) because the shuttle was full!!!!!!!!!! The only nice view from this hotel is a room smack in the middle of the hotel. At least from this part of the hotel you will have a nice view of the water and islands......the one and only "perk" from this hotel. The other rooms have herendous views of the concrete docking area and parking lots. Oh, yes........let's not forget........if you like to hear the roaring sound of a train then you will love the city view (or should we say, "parking lot views?"). I would not stay in this hotel again......NEVER! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I think staying in a youth hostel would be better! 4 star! HA! That is so funny!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR87608750">I had the best hotel experience of my life at this hotel! Right beside the Clipper so very convienient for travellers coming from Victoria with no car. We had an ocean view room and cruise ships passed back and forth the entire stay. The lights at night time were a beautiful view from the bed and the shower was amazing with a raining showerhead and glass walls with no door. The hotel was so uniquely decorated. The location is so close to eveything. I only want to stay here when i go to Seattle from now on.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR85659897">Talk about lipstick on a pig! The rooms on the water have great views; the rooms on the other side enjoy the railroad tracks. The rooms are so small if someone sits at the desk others canâ€™t walk behind. The desk is about half the depth of normal in an attempt to create more room but it doesnâ€™t work. You can always tell a hotel with a lipstick job by the room doors, the doors here are several generations old. The lobby has a cathedral ceiling but still feels cramped, hallways are narrow, and elevator doors look like 1965 Holiday Inn elevator doors repainted 20 times. The neighborhood is industrial and not inviting after dark. The hotel is too far from Pike Market and downtown shops to walk. Beds are OK except bottom sheet are not fitted which means you may enjoy sleeping on the mattress pad.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR84601456">We stayed here the night before our cruise to Alaska. The location could not have been better, right next door to the pier where our ship docked, and easy walking distance to Pike Place market, Space Needle and Sculpture Park. The room was fine, comfortable and clean. The service was generally as you would expect in a five star hotel - the check in clerk took perkiness to a whole new level, it was like a piece of performance art. We were amazed. Breakfast was great, the American breakfast option at $9 very good value. If I was in Seattle other than for a cruise I might look at other options, but for this particular occasion the Edgewater was terrific.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR84338193">First, there are no bathtubs in the bathrooms. Their website says nothing about this and, at a rate near $300 a night, in the United States (ie, not Europe), in a hotel (ie, not hostel), I don't think it's too much to ask for a bathtub. When I called down to see if any rooms had tubs, I was told I would have to pay a $75 upgrade per night. When I said they didn't let people know there were no tubs, that tubs were standard in nicer, American hotels, and asked if we couldn't work something out, stating that if we couldn't I would not remain for the rest of my stay, the lady flat said "no," told me I'd be charged for my first night whether I stayed or not, and hung up. Later I went down to meet a friend in the lobby and overheard a desk clerk talking to the second desk clerk about how much she hated Christians and that all church people were hypocrites, rude, and all the same. I felt this kind of conversation was not one that an employee should be having publicly and even if there weren't the previous issues, speaking negatively and stereotypically any group of people --regardless of the group attacked--religion, race, whatever--is highly unprofessional. The lobby was far from empty and who knows what guests in the lobby believe. When a male worker entered, she did quickly change the subject, but she shouldn't have been making the comments to begin with and the second employee should have done more than stood there and listened to it. Very uncool. The rooms are also very small and the halls smell like a men's freshman dormitory.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR84259298">The Edgewater Hotel bills itself as the only hotel in central Seattle that's on the water. It's actually built on a pier that juts out into the water. From the lobby, you can sit and look out the floor-to-ceiling windows and watch the ferries, tour boats and tugs come and go all day. My room had a view of the water, also. The staff in the restaurant were attentive and the breakfast I had there was great. Pike Place Market is easily within walking distance or a short taxi ride if the incline is too much for you. I highly recommend this place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR80948244">Wow. After staying at The Edgewater for multiple visits to Seattle over the years and planning to make this our "regular" place to stay, I'm sad to say that we are officially never staying here again. Why? Here's why: - paying 5-star rate for 2-star service - battling with constant noise disruption due to either a) where we've been placed in the hotel and/or b) how thin the walls are - having the manager be so completely and utterly rude and trying to justify us being kept awake all night by saying that this is a "rock 'n roll" hotel. Seriously? If Smoky-the-Bear-rustic-cabin retreat is "rock 'n roll", then I totally missed something along the way. This hotel is basically a cliche of "waterfront"...bad service and marginal value. Here are some good alternatives for the rate: Pan Pacific Four Seasons Grand Hyatt Fairmont And if you want "rock 'n roll" maybe try the W downtown which has a fighting chance of calling themselves that.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR80462903">We returned to the Edgewater after a 15 year absence and were very suprised to see how it's been tastefully updated. Nothing beats sitting overlooking the water in the lobby with a nice cocktail. We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel. The place is now has trendy feeling unlike the old comfortable Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR77175488">We arrived here expecting it to be great, we were excited about having a balcony over looking the water. When we checked in the lobby is beautiful and staff was friendly. We were in room 410 which is a junior sweet on the top floor, room was small but nice. We then went to look at this amazing view we had, and as we walked out on the balcony we realized it was in very poor shape. The wood was rotten the screws were not in all of the boards because they had rusted out, which made the floor will scary to walk on, As we started looking around we noticed the balcony next to us had a tie strap holding the rail to the entire fourth floor. I then called management and they informed me that they didn't know their was a tie strap holding the balcony rail up but they would send their engineer up to look at it. In the mean time we ate at Six Seven it was good. When we got back to are room I called back down to management who this time was very rude and said the balcony was safe and we should have no worries. We are not used to staying in run down hotels so we left that night an checked into Pan Pacific. It doesn't have a water view, but we had a safe balcony with city view, nicer room, and staff would go out of their way to help you.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR76841622">Check-in staff "upgraded" street level room to partial bay view room on second floor. The room, unfortunately, was the last one on the hall and served as the very early morning entry for cleaning staff. This meant repeated door openings and closings, conversation, and movement of bedding carts for almost two hours every morning. This would have been a perfect wake-up call for business travelers with early AM appointments but not for tired tourists who needed just a little more sleep. After check-in, one lamp needed a light bulb. Called down to replace the 60-watt bulb but staff left 40-warr bulb. It seems like a small thing but the overall lightling was dim, and uncomfortable for reading. The nightstand had a complimentary Book of Buddha but nothing else; desk staff stated that were not aware of this policy. The mattresses need to be replaced. Hall carpets darkly patterned; room decor and halls could benefit from ligher colorsMy concerns were voiced to the manager; Tiny business center; opening the doors barely misses the back of chairs. I was offered a complimentary cup of coffee and pastry on the morning of check-out.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR73187509">We stayed there pre-cruise for an excellent Priceline rate. You can't get a better location if you are going on an NCL cruise, we walked one block to the cruise terminal. The staff was friendly, and upgraded us for free to a larger room when they saw we had a family. BUT: (1) The carpet in the hallways and elevator was dirty. (2) The staff was incompetent. For example, our key card stopped working. The person at the front desk insisted on sending an engineer to check the door lock instead of letting us try a new key in case the old one got demagnetized. Waited 20 minutes for the engineer. Verdict: The key card was demagnetized, a new one solved the issue. (3) Many of the rooms have beautiful water views, but others face the rail tracks and are subject to freight cars 24/7. The windows were pretty good, but you still get some noise. (4) The staff didn't seem to have basic information about Seattle. More generally, the hotel looked like it had seen better days. For pre-cruise and &lt;$100, it's a decent deal. But I would have been sorely disappointed if I had paid the normal $200 plus rate.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR71788514">WE checked into the Edgewater and immediately was asked if you wanted an upgrade as they had booked up next to the street and the railroad tracks. We upgraded for $50 per night and was promised a large room but had to wait several hours. Went shopping and came back to a very small room on the water side. Had a balcony but the railing was so wobbley that was afraid to touch it, dangerous. Hotel is old with onlky a band-aid of an update. Staff was not friendly when asking directions. Altogether a BAD experience. Stay Away!!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR71413914">We stayed here for 2 nights, and were upgraded to a partial water view on the second night. Great beautiful location, but this hotel is definitely not for everyone. Here's the scoop: Location: Right on the water, close to the Seattle Art Museum. The views from the lobby are amazing, right onto the water. Unfortunately, it is right across the street from train tracks. The last train on Friday night was around midnight, and the first one Saturday morning was around 8:30. Last one Saturday night was around 6 p.m. A 5 minute walk to the aquarium along the water, where you can get some yummy ice cream and gift shops. There's also an amusement center with games and a carousel for the kids. Definitely take the elevator just a block or so walk away on the same side of the street up to the level of pike market. From there, it literally is a few minute walk away. On the way there, a World Market is a great place to get cheap snacks/drinks. $0.79 for a litre of water versus $3.29 along the waters. They sell beer and wine as well, with other house hold knick knacks. Hotel: As you approach the entrance, you're greeted by an amazing outdoor fireplace and water fountain. Great views from the lobby Floor to ceiling windows looking over the water. It's definitely has a unique decor. Fancy 'Alaskan' decorations. I wouldn't call it tacky (as others have), I quite liked it. This hotel has been awarded the 4 diamond rating from AAA 4 years in a row (according to the plaques on the wall). Great seating area in the lobby, a couple of fireplaces. Parking (valet) is $33 plus tax ($40 total) per night. That's standard for all downtown Seattle hotels (we stayed at the Westin once and it was $40 as well). After reading reviews, we parked across the street in a parkade. It's where all the cruise ship passengers park their cars. Only $20 per day. Safe and secure in my opinion. It closes at 11 p.m. and no in and out privileges. There's an attendant until it closes then the doors shut. Check-In Greeted warmly by a cheerful lady. No problems, and she upgraded us for the second night. Room City View As per previous reviewers, no matter what floor you're on, request a higher numbered room. For example, 238 is further away from the street (and the noise) than 211. Our room number was in the 30's so we were kind of in the middle. We could see the Space Needle and part of the harbour. Traffic noise was busy Friday as lots of people were in waiting to board the cruise ship the next day. The train wasn't too bad with the windows closed, but it does cause a low hum. Much louder when the train blows its whistle. I wasn't too bothered by it, but I can see how others might be. The room was on the smaller side, but comfortable. Nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was nice, yet small as well. I didn't mind it, but can see others wanting a bigger one. Lovely rain shower head, granite tiles in the shower. Good a/c. Each room has a gas fireplace, nice touch. The room was definitely decorated nicely, like a lodge. A fully stocked fridge, but no safe! You can give valuables to the front desk. Some parts of the room was squeaky, so not sure how the people below us felt. Room Water View The next night we were upgraded to a partial water view. Wow, what a difference. The rooms were much bigger. There was also a bear that acted like a foot stool. The patio was nice, 2 patio chairs and a table. We looked onto the cruise ship docks. A cruise ship was docked, so it obscured part of the view. But, we could still see out onto the water fairly well. Wow, nice, very nice. You could hear the water. Once the cruise ship left (at 4 p.m.) the view turned out nicer. We sat out on the patio and soaked in the view. Definitely can't be beat, I can only imagine what the full water view is like. Being on a lower floor, we could hear at times the people above us, as well as the bathroom. It really wasn't that bad, but I can see how it might bother some. Amenities No pool. Business center on the second floor with 2 computers with free internet. A lounge and a restaurant with gorgeous views. Didn't try the food, but smelled good. There is a gift shop on site. There's a free shuttle that will take you I believe anywhere within a mile or two. Overall I would recommend this hotel based on the excellent staff and location. If you're a light sleeper, then I'm not so sure unless you have a room furthest away from the street. The rooms are good (even the city view). We were lucky to have been upgraded. City view is 3.5/5 but partial water is definitely 4/5.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR71352938">We just stayed 2 nights at this hotel. It was so fun being on the waterfront side, watching all the activity in the Bay and the cruise ships...beware rooms 264 and 266, they are over the bar area of the hotel and they have bands on Friday and Saturday night...LOUD does not describe what it does in your room. They do stop at midnight, but if you are trying to sleep before that..you wont! No cups in the bathrooms for rinsing your mouth or drinking the tap water....view is amazing at night from the lounge/restaurant...service in lounge area very slow...pretty bad...BUT, I would go back here knowing what to ask for now!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR69692534">To be honest when I first walked in the room, I though of this place being a Motel 6 with a view, but I think I just didn't get it &amp; now I do. This place has spectacular views &amp; I don't care what anyone says, after a long day of touring, there is absolutely no better room I would want to walk into when it was time to settle down. Sure there are better hotels in the heart of the city with real 4 star amenities, but NO ONE will beat the view. It is so relaxing. The rooms are small and as someone said, kinda tacky looking. The bed is comfortable but soft. The bathroom doesn't seem to match the design of the room, but who cares! It's still nice. The staff is good but for some reason, the male staff seem more aloof. Weird but true. Room service for breakfast was expensive and the food was lukewarm. However, the Six Seven restaurant was nice. Now typically, that is not my type of dining, but three of us ordered something different and we all loved the food. The staff was accomodating and the view and decor in the restaurant was spectacular. I will add this, if you're not staying on the oceanview side, then stay at the Marriott up the street because its not worth it, with all things being considered. Everything that you need to do is within walking distance. If you're going to Pike Street, there is an elevator up the street that will assist you in getting up the deadly uphill climbs. There is a hotel shuttle that is free that we also take you and pick you up within the free zone &amp; must of what a tourist may do is within the free zones or walking distance from where you would be dropped off. The Victoria Clipper, the aquarium, and tons of other things to do are right up the street. It truly is in a great location. At night I just opened the windows and watched all the shipping boats, ferries, and cruise ships come in and out of port. I would stay again &amp; definitely recommend the hotel to others. One strange thing, but it was not a negative thing, the cleaning people are obsessed with cleaning the room. I have never seen anyone so eager to clean the room. It is as if they get reprimanded even if you tell them you don't want your room cleaned. Strange. Also, contrary to other reviewers, we didn't hear much noise from the surrounding rooms. A child upstairs would tumble and jump until like 8 pm, but after that, not a peep was heard. Who knows, maybe we were the loudest. FYI, instead of paying a lot for the tour cruises, take the round trip ferry rides for under $7/person to get in a nice sightseeing cruise of the puget sound. Booked through Travelocity which allows you to select the ocean view. Rooms were like $149 or so a night. Maybe less, I can't remember but definitely not more. Who is paying $300/night?<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR69554055">I truly loved staying at this hotel because the view was really incredible!!!!!!!

Like many of the reviewers I also obtained my reservation via Priceline, I paid $75 on Priceline + taxes of $18.65 for a total of $93.65 for one night. I agree that the valet parking is too much for one night and we left the car on the street for Monday (holiday) and fed the 2 hr meter at 8am Tuesday. Parking on the street was very easy for us and if that was unavailable there is a parking garage just across the street. We loved the location; we took walks along the waterfront and took a free bus to Safeco field and an $8.00 cab ride back to the hotel. The hotel also has four bicycles for use. The bikes are free to use and a bike lock is provided. The hotel is clean, and the views from the lobby and restaurant are fantastic. We did not have a view from our room and paid another $20?? for two beds. I would stay again but I would also prefer a hotel with a pool for my children. It overall seems like a 3 star hotel with a five star view.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR67295715">After looking online at the website and reviews we were expecting this to be a nice hotel but upon checking in we were really impressed. The location is absolutely stunning; floor to ceiling windows in all the public areas and the twinkling lights from across the water it's really beautiful. Our room was nice, really comfy bed, fancy bathroom and a nice touch with the fireplace. The only slight turnoff was the hotels constant opportunity to "upsell". Everyone these days expects to be charged if they take the bathrobe or clear out the minibar but it seemed as if everything was for sale, I wouldn't have been surprised to see a price tag on the bed or TV! We ate in the restaurant a couple of times (dinner and Sunday brunch) and were really impressed by the food. The dinner menu is fairly pricey but the standard of food is outstanding and there are lots of options if you want a lighter meal or a bar snack. If your staying in the hotel on a Saturday night we'd really recommend the Sunday brunch, that was $35 each very well spent. The only negative about this hotel is because it's built right on a pier there isn't much in the way of sound proofing. You certainly won't need to set your alarm for the morning as you'll be awake from the noise of bathrooms, footsteps and doors slamming as well as quite possibly the noise of your neighbours having .... ahem, a good time with each other (!!!) We'd love to visit Seattle again and would definitely stay at the Edgewater Hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR66668285">I dont understand all the negative reviews I read here and on other web sites about this hotel. Dont expect something for nothing and you wont be disappointed. Stayed here with my sister for a visit to Seattle. Reserved through Expedia at 150.00 a night. Upgraded to water view for 50.00 more a night and it was worth it. Beautiful view and nice little balcony to sit on. Bed was comfy and fie place was nice too. Room was small but adequate. Bathroom was very nice and modern. Lots of options for spending extra money, such as snacks and liquor but we simply brought our own bottle of wine and used the complementary wine glasses.

I express my concern when I check in regarding the noises on the first floor and was assure that it won't be an issue.

Literally right ON the water and 5 minute (uphill) walk to Pike Place Market, its tough to get better. The incredible location notwithstanding, there are a few things you need to know. First off - you need to book rooms that overlook the water. We stayed in a premium room (no deck) overlooking the water which was great...you could hear the water lapping up against the building at night which was very peaceful BUT the other half of the hotel (with decks) overlook an ugly parking lot view....not too nice. Also, make sure you know the following before you go; the hotel has NO pool, hot tub, steam room. Also, the gift shop closes very early so if you need any toiletries, etc...make sure to bring them with you or be aware of the early closing, it makes for a very inconveinent first night if not. I dont understand why they dont stay open later as it would not be that expensive for them to do so. The valet parking is a whopping $33 per day (on top of the already expenseive rooms) so be aware of that if you bring a car. The rooms are good, clean, and unique and it makes for a good stay but the stay is more unique/romantic, than "deluxe" so make sure that's what you're in the mood for. If you want to go for a great dinner (away from the tacky tourist dining in the near vicinity)....take the 15 minute cab ride to Ray's Boathouse in Ballard. One of the best dining experiences/location/service that we've had in years! We cant rave enough about Ray's.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR64249949">I stayed here for four nights while doing business in Seattle. I got the room through Priceline, so I did not have a choice of location. If I had the choice, I'd not choose the Edgewater as a place I'd want to return to. The only good thing about the location is that it's on the waterfront. Literally. it's on a pier on the edge of Puget Sound. However, it's not reasonably near anything of interest in Seattle, and if you want to walk, anyplace you'd want to go to from here is uphill, sometimes substantially so. After driving up from the Bay Area, the last thing I want to encounter is an extra $30/night (or so) for parking. It's a complete rip-off. Fortunately, the conference organizer got me a parking pass for the hotel where the conference was held, so I parked there for the duration and walked back and forth every day. In-room Internet? Not free. The room I got, overlooking the street and the train tracks, was one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever seen. Heck, it was smaller than the boutique hotel room I stayed in in Paris (France) several years ago. A bed barely fit in the room. A chair squeezed into the corner, and a narrow glass table ran along the wall opposite the end of the bed. The bed had a tall wooden headboard, and every time I rolled over, the headboard banged against the wall. (Sorry, neighbor.) There was a small gas fireplace in the corner, which apparently provided the heat. I much rather would have had a desk to do some work--although I wouldn't pay for Internet (did I mention Internet access isn't free?). The bathroom continued the "upscale" and pretentious theme, with a marble sink counter on a chrome pipe stand and a stone floor in the bathroom and shower. I found out the first morning that wet stone is slippery. Not the best material for a shower floor, that's for sure. The bathroom wasn't quite as small as the Red Roof by the Portland airport (where my knees poked out the door when I sat on the pot), but it was close. Most of it was form over function. About the only good things I can say about the room is that the bed itself was comfortable and there was a nice, decently sized flat-screen TV on the wall. Upon my exit, there was a charge for parking. At the desk, they found that I had been charged for someone else, so they removed the charge from my bill. When I checked my credit card bill a few weeks later, I found another mysterious charge, and I had to make a phone call to get it removed. It appears they look for every little way to nickel-and-dime you, and that's after getting exorbitant rates for tiny rooms.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR63895957">Location.

But we don't require much. We booked through Priceline which got us a great deal...What we paid was actually what the room was worth. It's a four star but no hot tub, spa or pool. Rooms are decent, facility is nice. Concierge staff are nice. Front desk staff, completely stupid. We received our bill for our parking charges. Which were $33USD per 24hrs. On $33/night bill, we were being taxed $6.44. Okay, we're from Canada and know our provincial tax. This is our first time in Seattle, and we know the state tax is roughly 10%. But when we asked the front desk what the state tax was she had NO idea what it was. We said, that this seemed to be a lot for parking taxes. We said, how could you not know what the state tax is? As far as we're concerned, if you own a business, you should know what taxes you're charging! She responded with sarcasm and proceeded to call a concierge for the answer...not a manager, a concierge who also didn't know. Then when he came and said it was 15%, we were like...uh, that still doesn't match up with this number...this is like 20%. The front desks' response, "Geeze, if I was better with a calculator, I'd figure it out for you." To which we replied, we don't need a calculator to know that this is almost 20%. At the end of it, we were charged what we were charged, and there was no explanation for it at all. Front staff was useless and rude. Thank GOD we didn't pay full price for this place!!! No complimentary internet. No free parking. No continental breakfast. No pool. No hot tub. No help at the front desk.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR63521091">Loved this spot! I'm even somewhat hesitant in writing this review since I want to keep this location under the radar. The decor is a mashup of lodge and ultra mod. I was lucky enough to have perfect partly cloudy warm sunny days while spending hours with my friends dining and drinking on the waters at Edgewater; an amazing experience! Cheers!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR60782792">I know, I know ... you were so excited to get that "four star" hotel on Priceline.com for less than $100 until you started reading the reviews and realized that you had been duped. Yes, you can almost be guaranteed that the Edgewater hotel will put you on the "city side" of the hotel (read: train tracks and parking lot/street noise) if you booked through Priceline.com. You may be one of the few luck ones, but it's not likely. Now that you have a reservation that cannot be changed or refunded, take a minute to just suck it up and let's make the best of it: Hopefully you bid only $70 to $80 for your room. If you are OK with trains and traffic outside your room, you can stop reading now. If you want the "four star" room you were promised, or as close to it as possible, read on: 1) Call the hotel immediately and ask to have your room upgraded to the water side (the side of the hotel the happy reviewers are talking about). A "partial water view" is currently $30 more and a "full water view" is $60 more per night. The partial water view is a joke. You will have a full view of a pier across the way with some dirty water between your window and the pier. Get the full water view upgrade. I know, it sucks, you're now paying $93 more ($33 for valet and $60 for a view) than you intended when booking through Priceline.com, but @ $163 to $173 per night, you are still paying half of what the hotel website is charging. 2) Whether you take my advice to upgrade, or not, you want to be in a room with a number of x40 or high - i.e., 240 instead of 232 or 156 instead of 122. Why you ask ... because the lower numbered rooms are closer to the street and train tracks. Of course if you have an odd-numbered room, you are on the parking lot/street side of the hotel anyway, but you can still make the best of it by trying to get as far away from the tracks as possible. 3) If you do upgrade to the water side of the hotel and ask for a "full view" room, make sure you are given an even number higher than x40 and preferably higher than x50. For example, 242 does not have as good a view of the water as 256 and 228 almost certainly will give you a wonderful view of a pier with train/street noise (note the sarcasm here). Also, as with all hotels, the higher the floor, the better the view. The 100's are almost at water level, 200's and 300's are fine, and the 400's are suites on the top floor. If you get an even numbered room, higher than x40 on either the second or third floor, you will be fine. 4) Parking is "valet only" @ $33 per night. Add this into your nightly cost. I know, it's outrageous that you are paying $33 per night to have a valet drive your car about 45 feet from where you dropped it off and you probably could have done this yourself, but you are just going to have to live with this too. If you don't want to pay the extra $33 per night for your room (plus tips), don't drive. Business Center: Two computers with internet in cramped room on each floor. Restaurant: Beautiful view, too pricey for the selection and qualify offered. Lobby: Some of the best views in the hotel. Bring your drinks and enjoy! Shuttle: The hotel does have a shuttle that can get you downtown, to Pike's Place or the Ferry Building, but keep in mind they can only operate within 1.5 miles of the hotel, so something like the Space Needs would be out. The bathrooms are nice - great showing. Sinks are odd and back up pretty frequently unless you only turn the faucets on half way. Furniture is old and tacky.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR60381891">Attentive staff, cozy rooms with fireplaces, close to the Pike Market and piers, great lounge and lobby...overall, a personal favorite, always stay there when in Seattle...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR60128740">The room was pretty small, it only offered 2 double beds and a cot for my 3 kids, my husband, and myself. The bathroom was nice though. There were no vending mashings so they offered in the room m&amp;m's for $3.50, and Figi water for $6. When we made reservations, they neglected to say that parking was $35 a night. The Hotel it's self was nice, you could go to the lounge and relax with an awesome water view. But I think it was a little pricey for what you get, unless you reserve a really nice room!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR59868742">I had an opportunity to enjoy a stay at the Edgewater in Seattle in March for an overnight before flying out of SEATAC. I travelled to Seattle on the Clipper so the location couldn't have been better. Just a 3 minute walk from the dock. While I was "aware' of the Edgewater and its past claim to fame (Beatles fishing from the window) I was completely blown away by the Pacific Northwest theme they have going on. It reminded me of the Doug Fir in Portland. My room was in great shape, spacious and had all I could ask for. I enjoyed the comfy chairs, fireplace and a really great bathroom. The complimentary internet access in the biz centre sufficed for my boarding pass printing and the bellman etc were all helpful. On checkin I witnessed the front desk clerk deal with a difficult situation with grace. Luckily I didn't have to park as every hotel in Seattle charges horrific nightly parking rates. The $30 nightly parking charge is actually less than many others I have stayed in most of Seattle's downtown hotels and I really enjoyed the Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR59614660">Hmmm....I am unsure exactly how I would sum up my stay at the Edgewater. I stayed for a night with my girlfriend in March so we could go out downtown and catch Martin Lawrence while he was in town. I got the room on priceline for $65 ($80 after taxes) so I was pretty happy heading into the evening. Like another poster mentioned, there is a parking garage across the street that you can park overnight in for $18...I just pulled right up to the valet and dropped my girlfriend off and then went and parked the car. Took about 2 minutes. Honestly though, I just don't get why this hotel has such a fancy rep? The people working the desk were not very friendly (they weren't unfriendly) but barely took the time to smile or greet me upon check in. Our room was up a few levels and towards the street although we kind of liked the train sound. It wasn't obnoxious and I like the background noise instead of listening to other guests thru the walls. Shower/bathroom were very nice; fireplace in the room was also cool. Ordered room service in the morning and was told it would be 1/2 hour....45 minutes to an hour later we were still waiting. Pancakes and a side of bacon and the bill was $23! Oh well. Neither of us liked the bed, we woke up at 7 am with aches all over although we should probably attribute that to the bottles of wine we drank the night before. Overall, the hotel is ok for the price I paid. I am a little scared to priceline another hotel though next week for the John Mayer concert b/c I am worried I may get the Edgewater again....what does that tell you? I wouldn't stay here again by choice; if I get hooked up again for cheap thru priceline I won't be too disappointed although I hope I don't! Last thought; paying for wireless sucks and I know that most hotels do this but come on.....<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR59382915">Read the other reviews. Many of them are spot on. This place is sub-par. Location is the only thing going for the Edgewater. The valet staff is good. There is a cost, per hour or per day, for internet use. Parking was $30 per night. The view from the restaurant is very good. Rooms are very small. People pay $200 or more per night to stay here?? Hard to fathom. I paid $80 on Priceline and I still feel as though I didn't get my money's worth. Stay elsewhere.

Amazing location! It's located right on the pier just like their name suggest.. Fantastic views. It's less than 5 minutes away from the Olympic Sculpture Park which is a nice stroll looking at some great sculptures. There's so much history regarding this hotel with Beatles having stayed there and fishing out their window from their room. I however was disappointed (might have to do with the discount from priceline) to find that my room was street-level and all the way down to the end of the wing. It faced the parking lot/street and a bit noisy with the train going by just across the street. Steep valet parking rates of $33 was also a buzz kill, but there's a parking structure just across the street from the hotel and it only costs $18/overnight. There's no real need to rent a car if you're planning to stay in the downtown area. There's a free tram with a stop right outside the hotel, that travels down the length of the pier if you're not feeling inclined to walk. Pike Place Market was two stops away on the tram and there's an elevator that takes you up the hill. I wished I had know this ahead of time. The rooms were cozy cabin-chic with a fireplace in the room and a teddy bear on the bed to greet you. I found the bed to be comfortable and clean sheets. The coverlet on my bed had something caked on it, which was a bit disturbing but who really doesn't know how dirty coverlets are. The bathroom was gorgeous. It's almost a cross between rustic and modern design. No tub, just a walk-in with ceiling to floor glass partition that only goes 2/3 of the length of the shower so the floor in the bathroom can get a little wet if you're not careful. I have to give rave reviews for the rain showerhead and the hot water - bliss! I didn't want that shower to end. Overall the hotel was decent for the price I received. I read about others getting upgraded for free for waterfront view which would have been lovely. I would still recommend this hotel to family and friends but I don't believe it lives up to a 4-star rating.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58076448">I had made a reservation for a stay in August 2009.

The service and rooms are nothing special however. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hallways have a strange unpleasant smell. The front desk staff were either poorly trained, uncaring, or both. At check in, after waiting in a short line, when I got up to the counter the woman behind the desk did not acknowledge me and instead took a long phone call. When she hung up to assist me, I was told my room wasn't ready ( the colleague I was traveling with got a room immediately) and I would be called when it was. 2 hours later with no call I went back to the desk and purposely talked to the other person who was working . A room was indeed ready. Having seen the rooms of 2 colleagues mine was particularly disappointing-very small with no room to set up the luggage rack, and no desk. I went back and asked for a room with a desk as I was there on business. The attendant told me none of the queen rooms had desks, and that he always warns business travelers about that (except me, I guess)-so if you stay there (I would recomend the Marriott down the street instead) be sure to ask for a King room. I mentioned the company I worked for and then did get upgraded to a king room with a partial water view. The city view rooms are depressing-so near, yet so far! The decor in the rooms is best described as cabin cute and not my style. The room was clean enough and the bed was comfortable with good pillows. The best part of the property besides the location (walking distance to Pike Place Market) is restaurant Six Seven. Excellent food and service the 4 meals I had there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56600933">My experience at Edgewater Hotel last week was a mixed one. I will start with bad experience. I was waken up by huge noise at 4:58 am the first morning. The noise lasted for about 15-20 min, then became quiet all the way to 7 am. After complaining to the front desk (I was offered another room, but just did not bother to move as it was late), the noise was postponed to 6:30 am on the second and the third morning. I got up and opend the door, just to find out hotel staff walking around (and talking). The noise seemed to have come from their moving the heavy laundry carts, as they would park in the narrow hallway during the day. That group of staff (and most probably the hotel management) did not seem to be aware of the guests staying in the hotel. The other factor that made this worse was the old, wooden building. It is not sound-proof at all. My good experience was with my daily trip to Downtown. The hotel has a van that would send guests to the city in the morning (free of charge). The driver was a nice person and offered a return service as long as I called him. The front desk and the vallet staff were also very nice. The hotel has a gorgeous waterfront view in the lobby and the reasaurant. I believe it has the same view in those waterfront rooms (unfortunately my room was on the street side). The room interior has a style, with a fireplace. The location of the hotel is good if you would like to walk along the waterfront, and visit the aquarium and the marketplace. But it is a little far from the busy street. I would not recommend walking near the aquarium area alone late in the evenings, as I was approached by a suspecious stranger there one evening. Overall, this hotel needs to improve its infrastructure to claim a four-star one. At this stage, it is a nice motel. If you go there for a casure trip, this hotel is still on my recommnedation list. But make sure you have the waterfront rooms and stay far away from the room 101. If you are on a business trip, not a good idea to stay there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56512488">I reserved this hotel through priceline and I should say it was one of the worst 4-star hotels I had ever seen. The decoration was not to my taste, which is not really a big deal. The main problems were: 1. The sink in the bathroom, the water would not go... so it would flood in less than 60 sec of running the water. 2. No bathtub in the "DELUXE" king bed rooms. Imagine we paid extra to upgrade the room from normal queen to a DELUXE king... :( 3. The water pressure in the shower did was very very weak, never saw such a weak shower in my life. It took me 30 minutes to get all the shampoo out of my hair. 4. The TV remote did not work. 5. The TV cabinet door would not stay open to watch TV. We had to stuck something in front of it to keep it open. 6. No coffee table or dining table or nothing. We had to eat on the bed... Very hard with the little one. 7. Very noisy. Every time the neighbours opened or closed their doors it was like they were in our room. We could hear everything in the hall ways. 8. Very expensive valet parking (but to be fair, we knew that before we go). $33+taxes for each day. But when priceline gives that to you you have no choice anymore. 9. Was not worth the $80+taxes (per night) we paid priceline, and $10+taxes (per night) for upgrade. I cannot imagine who would pay their regular $200+ prices for this low quality. Completely unsatisfied. (Staff were nice and friendly though). I totally loved the Silvercloud lake union and wished I would have stayed there. Stay away, specially if you have young kids.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR55846343">This hotel was beautiful. What else can I say?

The rooms stayed the same but the big difference this time was the air conditioner wasn't putting out cold air even though we had it on cool instead of heat. I was actually sweating in the room and had to open the window for some cold air. I called the front desk and they offered a fan but then later called to say that they are out. By that, I'm guessing other guests were experiencing the same thing which I thought is a little cheap of the hotel to do something like that considering a one night stay averages at $280 per night. The first time we went, everything was great. The room was nice, we had an ocean view and got to use the fireplace. It was a great experience overall and that prompted us to do it again to make it sort of an annual vacation but after this time, we've decided to change our plans. The hotel is great overall, they offer a lot of amenities like a shuttle that leaves every hour to bring you to the shopping district or anywhere within 1 - 2 miles, Valet, great lobby environment, restaurant in the hotel, business center and gym. It's very pricey in my opinion but a great place to stay.

Then she had the audacity to say she had no clue how the hotel billing system worked. yeah no clue and it was her job. on top of all of the problems with the billing i had to rescan my key card eveytime i left my room. the tv just shuts off at radom times the is a horrible clicking the the ventilation the will wake you up in the middle of the night in room 337. we satyed there for 3 days and not once did the maid take out the trash or make the beds there are several hidden charges including the 40 dollars a day for parking your car there and outragous taxes for the room. dont ever stay at the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR53873862">I stayed here alone for my 40th birthday to contemplate and be alone.

Upon leaving I left a tip and a thank you note for the maid, put a $20 in my pocket for the valet. When they pulled my car up, the guy got out with not so much as a nod and the other valets just stood there, doing nothing. My car is not fancy, a 1998 Toyota, but I was dressed decently, a female and had quite a large piece of luggage, plus a bag. They did NOTHING! I had to open the trunk and put everything in by myself as they stood there and ignored me. I couldn't beleive it. I had watched 5 Minutes prior a gentlman be helped with a nice car.

The scenery is amazing and our room was wonderful (despite the fireplace only working intermittently). That said, I'm not sure if I would stay at the Edgewater again. When we checked in, there was a line of 3 or 4 people and one not-very-helpful employee who kept disappearing. The situation when we checked out was similar. We asked the employee if we could store our bags for the day and after saying yes, he left the counter and did not return. We had to get back in line and appeal to a different person to assist us. But, by far the most egregious example of poor service is the fact that although the fire alarm went off twice during the night (scaring us to death and forcing us to quickly dress and try to find an exit with each occurrence- the second time, a maintenance man said that it was a false alarm) there was no apology or explanation when we checked out. Another guest standing next to us when checking out mentioned the 4 am fire alarms to an employee but the employee laughed it off and said, "Wasn't that something!" When I spend a decent amount of money to stay in a hotel and have my sleep interrupted twice during the night by a faulty alarm (or otherwise) I would like a mention of it and an apology. For this reason, I will not frequent the Edgewater Hotel again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR52591535">My husband, 2 teens and myself stayed here New Year's Eve for 2 nights. We received a good rate through Expedia on a Deluxe Cityside room. The room was clean, bathroom was nice and decor is 'lodgey'. We were out most of New Year's Eve doing things downtown. When came back to our room and went to bed around 2am new years day. At about 320 am we awoke to some very strange noises. Needless to say a very active couple were going at it LOUDLY. Remember the walls are paper thin so if you are going for intimacy purposes look elsewhere. Anyway, it became apparent that these noises weren't going to end anytime soon so I called the front desk, they called security and that was the end of that. The next morning we were exhausted. Luckily my kids were so exhausted that they had no idea what went on the night before. I called the front desk and thanked them for handling the situation and asked if the neighbors were checking out that day. She said yes and I said OK but could we please change rooms and have a fresh start? She was apologetic and put us in a waterside room as a courtesy. We accepted and we had a much quieter night. Valet parking is $30/nt. However, we checked out at noon and went on a Pike Place food tasting tour.

I stayed for a few nights with my gf on the 4th floor. We had a king sized bed with a waterfront view. The room itself was spacious, clean and well appointed with a huge flatscreen, working fireplace and a spa inspired bathroom. The style of the rooms (and hotel for that matter) was a rustic wilderness meets the modern world, warm and inviting. Everything worked just as it should have. The shower did have half a panel...but it made no difference to us. I suppose if you are showering like a maniac I can see it being a problem. The sink does fill up quickly... if you are turning the faucet on unreasonably to the max. We had no problem operating the shower, sink or anything else in the room. They have a business room that is complimentary. I found all of the bellman and front desk agents to be helpful and accommodating. Karen was a sweetheart. Pike Place is in walking distance, a 15 min. walk (we're from NY so walking wasn't a problem). There was an excellent restaurant called Anthony's just down the street. I will be staying at The Edgewater again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR50888458">We picked the Edgewater based on its 4-star rating and the downtown waterfront location on Pier 67. It's a property built in 1962 but looks great on the outside and around the public space. We had a waterfront room with views of Elliott Bay and gas fireplace. The room seems to have been renovated, size is fine, and decor resembles a lodge cabin. The bathroom is equipped with modern fixtures that look good at first glance but impractical and poorly conceived. The standing "spa" shower has only half a glass panel, so it's unavoidable that the bathroom floor would get wet no matter how we tried to adjust the shower head to point inward. The "vessel" sink comes with an instruction next to it - noting that the water needs to fill the vessel bowl to about 3/4 full before the draining starts, due to the lack of a overflow so pressure is needed to suck down the water. The vessel looks cute but we'd prefer a conventional sink that works. Look is not everything. The room is fine but having stayed in many hotels in the same class, we consider this property an average 3-star hotel, far from its "luxury" classification. The beds are on the soft side, some of the pillows smell musky so we had to spray some cologne on them to mask the odor. Parking is very expensive at $30+tax and valet only, so tips to valet each time we check in or check out the car. Internet is not free, but they have a business center with computers, free Internet and free printing. Since we always wonder about what it's like to stay at the Edgewater, we do not regret having stayed there, but once is good and we probably would not return. There are many other hotels in the same category with much better accommodations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR50536326">Contrary to many of the reviews here, our recent stay at the Edgewater was pleasantly pleasant. With all the comments on the size of the rooms, we were expecting a phone booth, but are pleased to report the room size was adequate. We got a room facing the city, and yes you can see the rail tracks but that didn't bother us much. Parking is valet only at $30 plus tax, but worth every penny as other lots in the area are iffy at best. We enjoyed the lobby fireplace and lounge area. Just kick back and stare at the water. The fact we didn't pay full fare probably enhanced our stay. $72 though PL is tough to complain.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR50379362">We spent 4 nights here and were disappointed with just about everything to do with this hotel except the food in the restaurant. The fireplace in our first room did not work. After 2 visits by maintenance people and 3 calls, we were switched to a new room. The fireplace in the second room gave off a strong gas smell. The maintenance person who checked it out told us other guests had reported the same problem in this room but after having used a gas sniffer the staff had decided the smell was from the fake fireplace logs heating up. We have owned a number of gas fireplaces and never had any gas smells from them like this. He also offered to switch us again but we decided to keep the deck door open a bit to provide fresh air rather than go through the bother of switching. The internet access was extremely slow most of the time - more like dial up than high speed. You could watch the various frames paint in the windows when they finally did display. We paid $10 a day for this - not advertised on the web site and usually free at other hotels we've stayed at. The parking is valet only. Again this isn't clear from the web site but the real shocker is a $30 per day charge for the service. There are commercial lots in the area but they are across active railway tracks, don't stay open all night, and have no security so you don't really have any choice. The food in the restaurant is excellent but they constantly play techno music which can get very annoying after a while. The halls were cold and didn't appear to be heated. The art work on the walls looked extremely faded with mostly blue colors left. The furnishings in the room were quite nice and would fit into a 4 star class hotel. However the bathroom sink has a design flaw and doesn't drain well. To address this the hotel provides a card on the sink that starts with " Hello. My name is Sink". That certainly isn't 4 star quality. The view from our room was outstanding - out across to Alki Beach and the Olympics. However the rooms on the other side of the hotel face active railway tracks so are really to be avoided. The trains run all night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR49711571">We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. Location is fantastic and we had a beautiful view out on the bay. Loved the room except we were wondering how much a patio or deck would add to the bill. We loved the sounds and smells of the bay. Our first night we just sat by the fire and looked out the window! Magnificent. I dont want to stay anywhere else! The room was comfortable and we loved the decor and the optional open bath. We recieved nothing but outstanding service from all employees. We did not visit the restaurant but we did sample the room service menu. The items we recieved were delivered in a timely manner and the food was delicious! The Location is within walking distance to most attractions and those that are not it is easy to hop on the frequent passing transit system which is free during the day. There is a charge for parking at the hotel but we decided our vehicle was much safer there than the alternatives. Its much easier to get around Seattle using the transit system opposed to trying to drive and park. The hotel even has a complementary shuttle offering to transport you to and from the Seattle attractions. We didn't have a need to use that service as the weather was quite accomidating. I definitely recommend this hotel as the best in Seattle but only if you enjoy sounds and smells of the bay! There are many boats coming and going at all hours and there is the aroma of the sea water and the activity on the bay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR48986870">We stayed at this hotel upon the recommendation of our travel agent. We were going on an Alaskan cruise, and stayed here the night before. The room was terribly expensive and very, very small. Our cabin on the cruise line was bigger than this hotel room. Also, there was a wedding on the floor that we stayed on, and kept us up most of the night. The management did not seem to care of our inconvenience. The food at the restaurant was very overpriced for what we got.

Some friends who live in the area recommended we stay at the Edgewater Hotel. The hotel is very cozy and was perfect for the time of year we were in Seattle. It is totally worth it to upgrade to a waterside room, we originally were in a streetside room but it just wasn't as nice. I think it was an extra $50 for the upgrade and totally worth it. The lounge and restaurant are great if you don't feel like dealing with the rain. Great location - we could basically walk to everything, never needed to take a cab except to the aiport. We would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR47193285">We travelled to Seattle for a weekend getaway and our first night was at the Edgewater and our 2nd night was at the Hotel Sierra in Bellevue. We had a Gift Certificate for a Waterside Room at the Edgewater but none were available the night we stayed so rather than the hotel upgrading us, they put us in a Deluxe City Side room which we did not argue with. It was far from Deluxe. Upon checking in, my husband was greeted with a curt "last name on the reservation?" No eye contact and no "Hello, how are you doing tonight?" At 4:30 a.m., we were awoken by the beeping sound of some big truck backing up into some part of the building, then the garbage truck came to do its pickup, then the train came whistling by. Then we thought someone was using our toilet but we figured out it was the loud plumbing rolling through the pipes in the walls when someone in other parts of the hotel flushed their toilets. The halls had a musky smell and the decor, well, we don't really know what to call it. Our 2nd night was with the Hotel Sierra in Bellevue which was far superior to The Edgwater. Hotel Sierra has no view of the water but it has friendly staff and fine customer service. Our stay over the weekend at the Edgewater was our last and we will now be staying with Hotel Sierra in Bellevue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR47118179">My husband and I had stayed at the Edgewater to celebrate our anniversary. The room we were in was right across from the bathroom for the conference rooms and right above the lounge. They were having a big wedding and the music and guests were very loud. We were getting the music from the wedding reception and the music from the lounge and the wedding guests going in and out of the bathroom laughing and yelling at each other until about 1 am. It sounded like they were in the room with us, which did not make for a relaxing evening. I had also ordered a gift for my husband which they had forgotten and it took them awhile to bring it up. The way the room was decorated was really cool, and the view was amazing. I thought the room was expensive for what we got.

The lobby literally looks down upon the water and is very restful. The decor is an interesting blend of cabin and hunter-chic, with columns fashioned out of tree bark and chandeliers of deer horn. The bathrooms had beautiful stone floors and a very clean, earthy feel. I would bring a pair of slippers and plan to use the in-room alarm clock, since the wake-up call we requested never came. The Edgewater will provide town-car shuttle service to the airport for a $40 dollar fee. The driver was courteous and arrived 30 minutes before our requested time, so that part went without a hitch. The hotel is a few feet away from Anthony's Pier 66 restaurant, so we didn't get to sample the room service or hotel restaurant menus, but Anthony's was superb. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves very much.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR46222567">My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here. We are locals, and the Edgewater has been a fav location over the years. I found a room in our budget (Cityview), which was around $150. It ended up being the smallest hotel room in which I've stayed in a very long time. It was beautifully decorated, and the bathroom was filled with beautiful design. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the service was slow. Had to call a couple of times to find out when our requested service would be arriving (i.e. technician to fix our fireplace and in room breakfast). Both were very late, and we really would have appreciated a call to let us know. If we had known the tech was coming from home, we would have said don't worry about it. While sometimes communicating can mean a person deciding not to use your service, it can also show them that you haven't forgotten them. The Edgewater is in a beautiful location, and many of the rooms are beautiful, so I still give it a thumbs up. But just know you will have to pay quite a bit more to get a more spacious room if you desire it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR46216990">It was an amazing stay. Although we are from the Seattle metro area we pricelined and got a fantastic deal to stay in a waterfront (which literally is right ON the water). We could open our window and throw crackers up in the air and watch the seagulls catch them on a "fly by". It was as if they were suspended in the air...I realize being a NW Washington girl that Seagulls have been referred to as "Rats of the sea" but it was so fun to watch with the ferries approaching in the distance from the San Juan Islands...gorgeous views. We had a clawfoot tub and fireplace topped off with a big stuffed bear ottoman. It was the most amazing weekend of playing "tourist" in our own city. I highly recommend staying here plus you can say you stayed in the same hotel that the Beatles once stayed in...however they fished from their room rather than feeding the seagulls...hahaa.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR45942188">I got one of the waterfront rooms with the bathtub and rain forest shower, it was a gorgeous view and very romantic.

Our room looked out over Elliot Bay and we loved opening our large sliding window and just taking in the view and sounds of the bay. The decor is what I would call Pacific Northwest. I loved our bathroom, specially the shower made from slate stones. The service was great. The lounge has a great happy hour (if you don't want to spend a lot of money on drinks, do not order Premium brands) and have terrific appetizers at a very affordable price. The restaurant itself offers great food and best of all, you can choose to have 1/2 portions incase you have stopped at the lounge first. The location is great with easy access to many places. The only thing I thought could have been improved in the room is the "drawer" space and the fact that they don't have free Internet in your room but do have a business center down the hall which has it. That's so retro!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR41157587">We stayed here with our senior parents for one night as we were booked on the Clipper to Victoria, B.C. the next morning. We got a Junior Suite close to the lobby. The room itself was basic with city view, a nice package price, and our parents were very pleased with the amenities. However, when time came for us to pull out the hide-a-bed we had nothing but coils to sleep on. Our parents were already settled in so we tried it, and got very little sleep. The other surprise was the $400 pre-auth on my credit card (for one night), which I had to have adjusted the following morning before we went into Canada (at 6:30 a.m.) We did eat in the lounge, and found the Happy Hour menu affordable. The Greek salad was very good. This was our third time staying at this facility, because the location is so good.

After assuring us that the AC has been fixed, we spent the entire night in a virtual sauna. My wife and I ended up sleeping outside - in the small balcony, to be awakened every other hour by a freight train. Then the following day, the toilet stopped flushing. Rather than disturbing the hotel staff from their hubris, I fixed the toilet myself. It now works. Overall, the room has a musty odor and it looks like the cleaning staff failed to remove remnants from tne previous occupants - there were dirty glasses and napkins in the sink when we came in. This hotel just made my list of worst places to stay.

Whilst we didn't have the glorious views of the bay like my sister's room, it was beautiful to see Seattle lit up at night. The room was surprisingly large with two (small) double beds. It made for a rather cosy couple of nights. The bathroom was modern and well finished. The hotel is a mix between a lodge cabin and a metal and glass. The combination works surprisngly well. They have made full use of the view of the bay. We ate only breakfast at the hotel, and the eggs bebendict were superb. You have to ask for a children's menu - as it is not offered automatically, and is a fraction of the cost of the adult menu. There was a wedding going on on one of the evenings, so a good evening to go down the pier walk and make our way to the Crab House. Superb service there, and the crab legs were amazing. The hotel staff were polite and efficient - and would be happy to stay there again. Enjoy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR38436808">From the minute we arrived, we felt pampered and appreciated. the valet was very nice and the desk clerk was too. The view from the lobby was gorgeous but the room was even better. We splurged for a waterview king room - we were traveling with our 12 year old daughter so we had to have a rollaway. We were concerned that the room would be cramped with the extra bed but it wasn't! Each room comes with a stuffed bear and a rubber duck - our duck was a boy but the front desk clerk changed him out for a girl duck. Our daughter was treated well even though the hotel seemed more for adults. We returned the favor by buying both the bear and duck (I'm sure that is their plan!) We had plenty of room and a really cool view of the water and the Seahawks stadium. We were right down the hall from the Beatles Suite. We kept our windows open when we were in the room and enjoyed the view and sounds of the Bay. We missed seeing the cruise ships by just a few hours. The walk along the Bay and to the Market was very nice. It was a little far to walk to the conference center - the hotel encourages the use of their shuttle service on their website and at the front desk. The shuttle driver would then recommend a taxi every time I asked him.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR36460936">We stayed at the Edgewater for three nights, our first impression was great. Great location, nice interior design &amp; friendly people. But unfortunately I think we got the wrong room... The airco was very loud, not only ours but we also enjoyed the neighbours one. Beside the airco our room was at the front of the hotel at the first floor and for some reason our window was next to an outdoor staircase and path. So we had no privacy at all... every 10 minutes somebody walked by and at night it didn't feel save.

After reading some of the reviews I did not expect the hotel to be anything really special... but it truly is. I think Seattle is a gorgeous city and while we have many very nice hotels this one stands out to me because it is the very epitome of Pacific Northwest and everything lovely Seattle has to offer. My husband and I pulled up to the valet parking to be greeted by a huge beautiful outdoor glassed- in fireplace. The valets were friendly and efficient. The lobby is open and airy with handsome furnishings and really nice views. Check in with Ben was quick and easy and to our delight we were upgraded to a gorgeous waterfront room. When we opened the door to our room we knew we were in for a treat. There is a beautiful bathroom with a glass and slate freestanding shower and a heavenly claw foot tub. There are French doors that open from the bathroom into the main room so you can enjoy the Puget Sound view while bathing. In the main room there was a huge modern log style king bed with lush linens and a TEDDY BEAR. There is also a sitting area with comfy leather chairs, a corner fireplace and a large furred bear ottoman that I really wanted to take home. (I saw that you can purchase them in their gift shop) There is a Lodge type, comfortable feel to everything, but in a modern contemporary way. Our room was on the second floor right above the restaurant. After taking time to fully appreciate our room and hearing all of the fun they were having below we decided to visit their happy hour :-). It was obviously a Seattle hotspot. It was a packed house. They have some seating outside right on the water. We had the most fabulous cocktails and while we had dinner reservations elsewhere the appetizers looked delish so we will have to try the Six Seven restaurant next visit . Later I read the the "Mixologist" has won national awards for his delicious concoctions. The hotel is in a good area of waterfront shopping and restaurants. It is pretty close to the cruise terminal too. After a wonderful night in Seattle we came back to our room, started the fireplace, opened the windows and a bottle of wine and just completely enjoyed the beautiful views, boat traffic and the twinkling lights of the city. I woke early the next morning to the sound of seagulls and ferries. I made a cup of Joe and took it all in again. It was our 20th anniversary and it couldn't have been more perfect unless we stayed longer. If you are looking for just any ol hotel you can find in any ol city this might not be the place for you.... but if you want a true Seattle experience it just doesn't get any better .<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34587135">I was so impressed with the room -- very large and wonderful bed, great claw footed tub and right on the water.

The furniture made out of fake animal parts is not to my personal taste, but some people like it. The Internet makes it look way nicer and larger. The room was tiny by my standards. This room cost us $393.00 CDN. Plus we were charged $30 US plus taxes for parking, and they charged us $1 US for each toll free call. I've stayed at fancier hotels than this but at least I felt I was getting value for the $. It was 30 degrees C outside and the air conditioner wouldn't work. The housekeeping staff had their bins out in the hall way into the evening and back at 5 a.m. with so much commotion they woke us up. Also this hotel is away from it all so if you are disabled or older, you'll need to use transportation to get to Pike St. Market. We also had a lot of hullabaloo in the morning on the pier next to us, a cruise ship coming in at all. That I didn't mind at all, it was part of the experience of staying at a hotel on a pier.

We looked at three rooms before we finally settled on one with an amazing view of Elliot Bay out to Bainbridge. We watched the classic boats leave the harbor, saw jellyfish swimming under our window and waved to the cruise ship travellers. Wine list was decent, service for bar/appetizers was a bit slow, we moved to the bar. Service at the front desk was terrific, they held our luggage until check-in, remembered my husband's birthday (I wasn't even aware I'd mentioned it when making the reservation) and remained very patient while we "room shopped" before check in. We used their shuttle service, no need for a car. Perfect location for our needs, just walk to Pike's, downtown, etc. I left a favorite sweater in the closet and realized it two days later. They found it, wrapped it and kept it at the front desk until we came back through town.

I was expecting the worst after reading the reviews, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! Check-in was efficient (not super friendly, but not unfriendly) and our room was on the ground floor. Asides from being on the ground floor, the room was lovely, very nicely appointed, spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous. Lovely and modern and large. The hotel also has a lovely restaurant built over the water. As for the location, I would call this edge of Belltown, and its a bit of a walk to the main area where the shops and restaurants are, but we love to walk so we didnt mind. Also, there are lots of great restaurants in Belltown, just a couple of blocks away from the hotel. You must try the Macrina Cafe for breakfast one day, divine! As for parking, do not pay for the hotels outrageously priced valet, simply park your car in the Diamond parking lot two short blocks away at Vine and Elliot, half the price! The overall value of the hotel is great if you get the right price! We paid $75 us per night.

There is not much of a common area, no pool, no spa, no nothing (no basic stuff u d expect at a 4 star hotel). Over all the interior feels like you are in an old cruise ship. The passages are dark and narrow, rooms really small. The decor is like an old lodge (to make you feel like you are staying in a small family owned motel.) The bathrooms are very small but nicely redone (with contemporary fixtures that obviously dont match the rest of the lodge decor.) I was also disappointed with room service. we ordered for breakfast and requested for extra sweetener and creamer ( as we had run out of the provided 2 sachets of sugar and 2 equal sachets the previous day). The breakfast arrived after 45 mins. They brought us creamer but forgot the sweetener. I called room service again but they said it would take another 30 mins to 45 mins. I requested for bringing it asap and followed up with another phone call but the sweetner NEVER arrived and I could not even get a cup of my morning coffee! They tend to cut costs on moisturizer, toothpastes, etc as they donot provide them even on request! They were kind enough to provide towels and shampoo conditioner!

Everyone was extremely helpful and courteous. As many of these reviews will tell you, the rooms are very small. In spring and summer, you don't get much of a fire in the gas fireplace, since it is also the room heater. The little "in-room" goodies (bar, snacks, rubber duck, and teddy bear) were way expensive. The parking charge was a real surprise at $30 per night. Also, the restaurant is nice but plan on about $40-60 per person for dinner. Another surprise on the car rental was all the taxes added up to 30% (11.9% airport tax). Tourism tax (9.7%), plus sales tax (9.5%), on the room added up to 18%.

I was told that they'd have to call me when the room was ready. Since I hadn't heard from anyone by 4:30pm went back and found out that room was ready and they seemed surprised that no one had called. The staff were all pleasant but the front desk staff on the three occasions I went by were quite scattered. The room was really hot when we entered. The fireplace was going and probably my major complaint was that it was really difficult to maintain a proper temperature. The fan kept going off and on all night which disturbed my wife. Probably shouldn't have used the auto setting. If you're on the train side take a room on the lower floor and as far down the hall as possible. We couldn't hear the trains. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was quite nice. The gym had good aerobic equipment and average weight equipment.

It was an easy cab ride from Sea-Tac, $43 with tip. Staff was great, but was offered the same $30 upgrade bit as mentioned in reviews below. Actually annoying as hell to hear this pitch. (Just don't accept my Priceline bid if you need to upcharge me to get a room worth a crap.) And no one should be put into the rooms closest to the street unless that is the last resort. Room was #205 and was a long walk that took me as close to the railroad tracks as possible. Trains ran pretty heavy around the 9-10 pm window, but were pretty quiet after that. Truth be told with the sliding doors closed you could not really hear much noise. (Had to keep the windows open for a while to cool off the room that was hot as blazes) Overall I would liken it to a stay in any large noisy downtown. Room was okay, and bathrooms were nicely appointed. Breakfast was a priced appropriatley for a business travelerand it was nice to eat on the water. I would not book a romantic weekend at this hotel unless I was paying full fare...the priceline room with its view of the street, and eye level to pedestrians just would not keep a good vibe. Would not recommend this if you are expecting a 4star, but it is okay for a business traveler expecting a 3 star room and looking to save a few bucks. I have heard that a lot of operaters treat Priceline referrals like crap, this is the first hotel that has proved this myth true. Poor word of mouth is from the customers getting a "deal" is just as damaging as those paying full fare. Management here should learn to NOT treat Priceline customers as second class citizens. Sticking customers next to dumpsters and train tracks when you have better rooms available for "upgrade" is bush league at best. With occupancy down you need all the goodwill you can get. Guess I'll go back to paying full fare at Hotel 1000 for the rest of my stays.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR26939831">I want to make it clear that I am not a picky guest at most hotels, but when I am told I'm getting a 4 star hotel, I hope to see something decent. Don't even think about booking this hotel through priceline if you don't plan to put any money into an upgrade. Here's the deal: They stick you in a room that has a view of the hotel dumpster or on the first floor next to the train tracks with the bell dinging all night. Was the unupgraded room a four star room? Ha, not even a 3 star at best. I'm a local, and one of the only reasons I booked this hotel is for the view. The door didn't even lock. I had to pull the door shut to ensure it locked. To get out of that dump hole, I asked how much an upgrade was and they quoted me $30. This hotel was next to empty during the time I stayed so they could have atleast comped it. Nope. I decided I'd prefer to pay $30 and not look at a dumpster since I already invested $100 into the hotel expecting SOME water view. This time I got a room on the 4th floor with a view of both the city and the water. The view was nice and the bathroom was nice. The room itself was small small small but since I booked a king bed room, I got a balcony. Another important thing to note, only rooms with a king bed have balconies. If you are after two doubles, your not getting a balcony. The views were wonderful of the water, but the hotel itself is not nearly a 4 star hotel. I hardly think it was a 3.5 star. The lobby is beautiful so enjoy it. I hope your stay is better than mine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26421585">My wife and I recently travelled to Seattle for a business convention and were looking for a place that had great views of the sound and was not downtown. The Edgewater definitely did not disappoint with the views, they were great. We had a room that overlooked the water. The rooms were well spaced and had a very lodge like feeling to them. The location was great, within walking distance to Pike Place market...although if the weather was bad, it would have been too long of a walk. But there are some great seafood restaurants about a block or two down the street. We ate at Anthony's one night and it was great. I noticed that the hotel charged for parking, which I always think is very cheap. We also ate at the restaurant one night that is in the hotel. While the food was good, the portions were really small and meal was very expensive for what we got. My wife asked for a recommendation for a white wine to go with her fish, and the waitress recommend one. When the bill came, the glass of wine was $21! Did not think that was very good thing. Overall though, we would definitely stay at the Edgewater again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26086878">My friend got us a great deal on Priceline at the Edgewater. We were there for 4 nights this past weekend. I was a little concerned when I saw all of the mixed reviews but I must report back that my experience was completely positive. We got a room on the 3rd floor and it was very quiet. We overlooked the parking lot AND the Space Needle (very cool). I thought the decor was lovely, both downstairs and in the room. The bathroom is very spa-like and everything was meticulously clean. We loved the flat screen tv and two comfy chairs in front of the fireplace. The fireplace doesn't have much warmth (maybe it is for show?) but our room was always very comfortable. The floor to ceiling glass windows in the bar and restaurant offer incredible views. Every single staff person was friendly and helpful to us. I can't speak about any other hotels in the area as this was my first time in Seattle, but I loved staying in a unique place rather than the typical cookie-cutter hotel room. The location is really fantastic too.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR25903011">I just stayed at the Edgewater Hotel and I had a memorable stay. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, it has a feel of a lodge with fireplaces everywhere (from the main entrance, to the lobby, inside th restaurant, inside the lounge and best of all in the room). The hotel offers a scenic view of Elliott Bay on one side and the Space Needle on the other. The staff were very accommodating. I did eat breakfast at the Six Seven restaurant and it was delicious as well as inexpensive (the dinner menu is a lot more expensive). The hotel is not located in Downtown Seattle, it's a little removed from all the action however the hotel offers a shuttle bus that runs every hour on the hour. The shuttle bus will take you anywhere you want to go within the tourist area. I was dropped off at the Space Needle, when I was done there I called the bus picked me up within 5 minutes and dropped me off at Pioneer Square. If you prefer to stay in, I found it very relaxing to grab a book and hang out by the fireplace in the lobby, just relaxing and enjoyting the view of Elliott Bay. The hotel also has a lounge with an extensive assortment of beverages. Overall this was a wonderful place to stay, it has a very unique atmosphere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25858443">This hotel is in a great location in Seattle.

I bid on 4 nights on Priceline for the price of $100 a night. At first I was pretty excited to get such a good price on an expensive 4 star hotel in Seattle. But then I read reviews on Trip Advisor and became skeptical because of hearing some negative reviews about room size, decor, etc. After booking on Priceline, I called the hotel directly to confirm my reservation and to request a room with 2 beds because I needed to accommodate 3 people in the room. The lady on the phone informed me that she could put in a request for a room with 2 beds, but the only way I could guarantee a room with 2 beds was to pay an extra $20. I decided to take my chances and not pay the extra money. When I arrived at the hotel, I found out that we did end up with a city view room with 2 double beds. The room was nice, but a little small for 3 people. The beds were uncomfortable to fit more than one person in a bed. The fireplace was a nice perk, but didn't really seem to put out much heat. The bear foot rest was a little tacky. The bathroom was beautiful and large. Unfortunately the double doors to get into the bathroom were awkward and loud to open and close. The sink in the bathroom was also difficult to use without getting water all over the counter. We requested to not have our room cleaned while we were there, but it was cleaned one day against our request. The bar area was nice but the temperature was set very low. They had a "happy hour" special that ran Sunday thru Thursday. $5 appetizers and drink specials. This was a nice perk, because the prices are normally pretty steep. We did have a few negative experiences in the bar. The first night we arrived, we went down to the bar with some drinks from our room to listen to a band playing. As soon as we arrived in the bar, a staff member came up to us and asked us "if he could take our drinks from us." We didn't really understand what he was asking us but then realized he was being vague about not allowing drinks in the bar that weren't purchased there. We left the bar to return our drinks to the room and returned to find the band was done playing. At this point it was about 12:30 or 1am and we sat to order drinks. When we asked if they had the specific beer "Samuel Adams" they just said no and didn't offer an alternative. At most other high end bars I have gone too, they will usually offer some similar alternative. After we were there for about 15 minutes, the staff started rudely flickering the lights on and off. I assumed that this was to indicate that they were trying to close, but I felt this was a very inappropriate way to convey this message at such a high end bar. They could have politely come up to us and tell us "last call" or "we are going to close soon, so this will be your last drink." The next day we complained to the front desk, and they told us they would talk to the bar manager regarding this. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a friend as long as they get a good price on Priceline or Hotwire, but I would not recommend paying the rates the offer directly from the hotel. I wouldnâ€™t consider this a 4 star hotel that Priceline rates it at; it is more like a 3 star. On a side note, the parking at the hotel was $30 a night. This is pretty steep, but parking in Seattle is generally expensive. We found a parking garage one block away from the hotel on Elliot and Vine that was only $17 per 24 hour block. I would highly recommend this garage, especially if you are not planning on using your car much to get around Seattle. We left the car there our whole trip for almost half the cost of keeping it at the hotel. And the parking garage is covered; parking at the hotel is a valet at a surface lot a few feet away from the entrance. You would think that for $30 you would at least get a parking spot that is covered!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25271243">Our total experience at this hotel was very disappointing. We traveled to Seattle for business, and we bought this room on an on-line auction site. We paid $90, including tax. After we won the auction, my travel partner called the hotel to make sure and reserve a room with two beds. The hotel told her that they "might" have one available when we checked in, but if they didn't, there would be a $20 charge! We called two different hotel staff members at two different times and each was as unhelpful as the other. Finally, on the 3rd call, the woman said there would be no charge to "upgrade" to a room with 2 beds. Since when is requesting 2 beds in a hotel room an "upgrade"?? When we arrived, we found the decor laughable (a tacky "lodge" decor more suitable to Wyoming or Montana than to the Seattle waterfront). After refusing to pay the $20 to "upgrade" to 2 beds, we were given a room at no extra charge. There were no luggage carts to take our bags to our room, and they gave us a room as far away from the lobby as possible, right next to the street, with a "city view" (not exactly what I would call a view). (The waterfront rooms DO have a beautiful view of Puget Sound). The decor was tacky, particularly the dirty, furry "bear" foot stool, and the room was small and had a funny smell. The bathroom was a decent size, but totally did not match the rest of the decor. The only source of heat was a gas fireplace, with a fake rock surround. The fire came on and off all night; so the room was hot, then cold, then hot again. Plus, the light from the fire coming on would wake me up. When we went to get ready for our seminar in the morning, the show head (a rain head type) was broken so you had to stand directly under it (and on top of the shower drain) to shower. There was one small mirror in the bathroom, and one vessel sink, making it impossible for two people to get ready at the same time. And finally, the TV cabinet doors wouldn't stay open because the floors in the room were so un-level! No free wi-fi either. A small thing, but one of my pillowcases was on inside out!! As others have mentioned, the trains ran all night and woke us up several times, the room above us had an extremely noisy fan, or something, running on and off all night, and at one point my roommate was woken up by someone yelling. We visited the bar and were treated to a giant TV screen (10' or so wide) playing a nature film - featuring large animals (like wolves) killing small animals. What the heck is with that??!? This is no 4 star hotel! Priceline (and other auction sites) should put it in a 2 or 3 star catagory.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR25144001">Overall, I had a good experience at this hotel and would probably recommend it if you can get a good price on Hotwire, Priceline, etc. The staff is really great, and I had a lovely view on the water overlooking Mt. Rainier and the Sound. The bar and restaurant both had a very chic vibe, and I thought the modern lodge decor was interesting and tasteful. Room, however, was a different story. While my bathroom was fantastic, the rest of the room was just plain weird and in need of upgrades (minus the enormous flat screen tv): room smelled odd, which I think was from the wood they used for the dresser? Giant stuffed bear in front of the fireplace? Kinda gross. As opposed to the modern, interesting decor of the bar/restaurant, the rooms are just disappointing. Valet parking prices were steep, but I'm not sure if that's commonplace for the rest of Seattle. While I was only here one night for business, I really liked the area. It's a nice walk to the Pike Place Market, and some great shopping and unique restaurants/bars. Like I said, I'd recommend, but only if you get a good deal.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR25025716">This is the second time I have stayed in this hotel after booking it through Priceline. The first time I stayed we were offered an upgrade to the water side for $50 and took it. We were offered it again this time but declined so that we could put the money toward a nice dinner. Our room was on the third floor closest to the road and train tracks that others have written about. My friend and I both sleep with earplugs, so noise wasn't and issue for us, but it definitely is quite noisy on that side and if you are sensitive to noise at all, it will probably be a problem and might be worth booking the water side instead (where I didn't hear the trains at all). The decor is a bit odd for an ocean-side hotel - hunting lodge chic is how I would describe it. There is no close place to get a coffee in the morning, so I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning. The food wasn't outstanding, but you can't beat the view. We sat in the lounge with drinks one afternoon reading and looking over the water and it was wonderful.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24963344">The Edgewater is a really quirky hotel.

It has beautiful views of the Sound, and a great spot right on the water. I did not find it hard to walk or take a short taxi to downtown Seattle. The decor is lodge-y: exposed beams, big armchairs, river-rock fireplaces. I was in Seattle on business, but felt like I should be heading out for a day of skiing when I left the Edgewater every morning. The big problem: my room was literally freezing. A maid informed me that the hotel does not turn on the heating system until it reaches a certain temperature outside. When I stayed there it must have been in the 40s--brrrr. But managemnt did not think it was cold enough to turn on the heat. There was a fireplace in the room, but it took hous for that to heat the room. In the meantime I sat there with my jacket and hat on. The first night I was so cold that I left and went to my boyfriend's hotel (he happened to be in Seattle on business at the same time as me). The other thing abouit the fireplace is that you have to press the re-start button every hour for it to work, and so there was no heat in the room during the night, unless you want to get up every hour and press the button. It was SO cold in the mornings. I would not stay in the Edgewater during the winter months. Summer would be much better. I had a priceline deal for $150 per night. Which would be a steal for that room in the summer. As I stayed in the winter, it was totally inhospitable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24471949">This is an overpriced, beyond its prime, rip-off hotel. It has the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in. The only desk in the room was a glass table at the foot of the bed. They put you in the rooms facing the street about 50 yards from the train tracks and the trains run all night. When I asked to be moved they said it would be a $50 upcharge for the "non-train" side. $30/night parking with valet only (parking lot is right in front) so you are stuck with tipping the valets every time you need your car. The carpet is old and musty and even stained in the hallways. The front desk personnel could care less if you are happy or not. I made my reservation the night before and they demanded to photocopy my drivers license in case my credit card was no good or if I "trashed the room"! The room was so hot (February) I had to open the window (street noise) to cool it off. You could not adjust the temperature down. The gas fireplace produces heat even when not in use. I asked to have it turned off and they said they would have to relight the pilot if they did.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR24207371">Years ago, my husband and I took a romantic weekend from Vancouver, BC down to Seattle for the weekend. We were lucky enough to get a room at the Edgewater Hotel right on the water. We probably got the room because we stayed there in January, but what a fabulous weekend it was. If you're there to see Seattle, the location of the hotel couldn't be more perfect. The room we had was kind of small, but it was so quaint and cozy, and the service far surpassed all the other hotels we've been to in the city. In the evenings, we'd sit and watch the boats coming into the harbor and just enjoy. We were so close to all the best restaurants in the city, and all of the typical Seattle attractions. The hotel made our romantic weekend very special and we'll definitely go back there, if we can get a room! You'd better book FAR in advance if you want to stay there. You can really enjoy Seattle in a different way when you stay at the Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR24172483">Our settled policy in Seattle is that Grandma and Grandpa graciously decline the use of the sofa bed in the TV room and book somewhere in the downtown area. We do this about four times a year and have come to know the downtown hotel scene fairly well. The economy being the mess it is, we booked on Priceline and wound up with the Edgewater. After reading some of the reviews, I was struck with bigtime buyer's remorse. Totally unfounded, I mean REALLY unfounded! We had a very pleasent stay and would return. On arrival our room was upgraded to a King (no charge). We were offered a waterside room at an additional $20 per nite. We declined. We asked about the dreaded train noise and were given earplugs. Unless you are a very light sleeper, a room above the second floor has minimal traffic noise. The decor is what it is. I would not have rustic lodge in my house but this works well in its setting. The furniture and fabrics were in good shape and the linens were of excellent quality. Robes were included in room. The toiletries were Noble House spa products including glycerine and bath bars. The bathroom was one of the largest we have had in Seattle and very well appointed vis a vis lighting and makeup/shaving mirrors. A full sized hair dryer is included. The towels are big and fluffy. The bed is very comfortable. I had read some complaints about the housekeeping. I, mother of the Executive Houskeeper of a competing chain, know exactly where to look. I looked. Whoever Linda is, she knows how to clean an hotel room. Over a 3 nite stay, the service was consistant. The front desk is equally responsive to requests. We have the minibar and the snack basket removed upon arrival. I try not to have Godiva Chocolates and other gratuitous carbs dangled in front of my diabetic spouse. They are very nice and pricey carbs if one is interested. The cab service, shuttles and wake-ups were all performed cheerfully and as requested. They corrected a room service billing error no questions asked. The restaurant food is good. In Seattle you have to be good or you're gone. There is too much good food in this city to tolerate the mediocre. The service is cheerful but a bit absent minded. Corrections are taken in good part however. A very "no Harm, No Foul" sort of attitude. Room service hours are on the short side and very early departures need to make other arrangements for breakfast. We had a very positive experience and would stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23052252">My daughter and I made our annual 'day after Christmas' trip to Seattle and had decided to try the Edgewater Hotel. I found it to be a quaint, out of the ordinary place. The rooms were very nice and clean, the staff was friendly, and the food was just fine. Our room was lovely; we were given a room on the third floor overlooking the water. We had a great view of the ferry/shipping lanes and when it got dark the NOAA ship next door was all lit up with Christmas lights - quite beautiful. My only complaint is that the walls in this hotel are very thin. We heard everyone who walked by but worse, we heard a lot of noise from the room next door. It was late so we didn't call down, but I'm guessing from the sounds of things it was a couple on their honeymoon or something. It was a little embarassing to be sitting by the fire reading with my teenage daughter and hear the very obvious sounds that came from the next room. All in all, we'd likely stay here again sometime.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR23025155">This place was terrible just as many of the reviewers on Tripadvisor indicates. The last couple of reviews looks like it was written by hotel staff since they are the exact opposite of the real experience. From the low quality toiletries to the inconsistent house keeping this property should be rated a 3 star. Attempts are made to give the property a unique look but it only succeeds in making you gag from the incredibly poor taste in which everything is decorated. It almost seems like a big joke that everyone else is in on except for you. The hotel is noisy, the rooms tiny, the decor ugly, the staff is average, it is isolated from the rest of Seattle, the view is overrated, the nearby train is noisy, and the room stinky. The lounge had expensive $10 drinks and a good view but absolutely no character. After experiencing the boring lounge we decided not to bother with the restaurant and instead cabbed it into the city for food. I recommend using Tripadvisor and pick a 4 star hotel out of the top twenty instead of being foolish like we were and pay the consequences. In fact, you can probably pick a highly rated 3 star hotel and still fare ten times better than we did.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23019863">My husband and I came to Seattle for an inspiring Christmas experience. The Edgewater met our expectations and exceeded them in every way. from the attentive and knowledgeable valet staff to the sweet front desk staff, they charmed us the minute we disembarked from our car. Our waterfront room was beautifully appointed, from the large arm chairs to the fireplace to the comfortable king bed with the crisp linens. It was fun to watch Elliott Bay or the big screen tv from the comfort of the claw foot tub. My only regret is that we didn't bring our Miniature Pinscher, Faulkner to enjoy this stay with us. The hotel welcomes pets and we met a couple of adorable furry pals while here.

The hotel is a four star hotel with very good service. Our room was an ocean view and all rooms have a fireplace. Our room had a claw foot tub, large glass (no door) shower and lots of granite. The bed was a pillow top and very comfortable. We enjoyed the modern, rustic look with the pine and river rock. If you are looking for a 4-star without character, then this is not for you. If you are looking for a Northwest (very nice) cabin feel, you have found home. The hotel is 100% non-smoking and clean.They provide a shuttle every hour on the hour to local spots.The only draw backs are as follows: Parking is $28 (valet) per night, the drinks are $10 each and they stop serving breakfast at 10 on Sunday to prepare for brunch. In recap, the view is fantastic, the service was great and the room was perfect.

This year through an auction site we ended up at the Edgewater for around $120/with tax. Upon arrival we were told we needed to shell out another $30.00 to get a waterside room. We obliged thinking we got a good price through the auction site and were in the holiday spirit. Once in the room it had an overwhelming smell of smoke upon arrival even though the check in person told us twice the hotel was non smoking. Our water view was nice but too close to a dock where a large boat was being worked on even late at night! The decor of the hallway and the room were very dated and did not have a "Seattle" feel. This hotel is not worth more than $120/night, I feel very sorry for others that have paid $250/night for this place especially for a room that is not waterside. I would not recommend this to anyone as there are so many other better alternatives in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR22302283">We were upgraded to a water view room yesterday upon arrival with no extra fee involved.

On paper it looked like we got a steal of a deal for a waterfront 4* Seattle hotel. Upon arrival we immediately realized that the hotel is probably having trouble filling their rooms through conventional means and are now resorting to auction sites to try and fill rooms. The entire hotel is decorated with cheesy ornaments and prints to give it an old run down log cabin type feel. It cold be used for an over the top comedy set to shoot movies like Dumb and Dumber. During check in I was told that my room rate will get me a 1st floor queen bed and that it will cost me $30/night to upgrade to a king on the water side. I declined and magically received a 2nd floor king bedroom on the city side for no extra fee. The city view can probably be more adequately described as a noisy rail road track view. Overall the hotel seemed more like a 3* instead of a 4* when taking into account the low quality toiletries and housekeeping. We tipped housekeeping every morning and received different service every day. The first morning they removed our dirty glasses and did not bother replacing them with new ones, they did not take out the garbage and left the ice bucket full of water with no replacement bag. This routine continued for the remainder of our stay. Inconsistent housekeeping means a lack of quality control which is supposed to be held in high regard at 4 and 5 * hotels. Overall the hotel was worth the $120/night but not a dollar more. We will not be staying here again and do not recommend it for any other travelers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22016025">My date an I had one drink at the bar, and were clearly not inebriated.

The truth of the matter is my date had a prosthetic leg, and walked with a limp naturally. My date was horribly embarrassed by the manager and waitress in front of a large group of people. Clearly, people with disabilities are not welcome at the Edgewater. Or maybe it was because my date happened to be of a different race than everybody else.

When we met with our sales representative and her manager we were told that the original estimate was just that, an estimate. They then assured us, however, that our satisfaction is their priority; theyâ€™d review the final bill and see if we could â€œmeet in the middle somewhere.â€� Our sales representative called us five days later to let us know that the best they could do was offer to reduce our final bill by roughly $1,600.

If I had stayed at the Quality Inn, I would have had free internet, free breakfast and a free shuttle to pier 30 for my cruise the next day. The Edgewater had none of this. The Edgewater charged $10/person for a ride to the pier so the 3 of us took at cab for $15.

I had this hotel booked for me by the company I was visiting and having read a number of reviews on this hotel which were pretty mixed I was concerned at what I would find. The room: I had a deluxe 'city scape' view which was a resonable size and overlooked the entrance to the hotel. The room itself was clean the bed comfortable but for me personally the decor was not what you would expect in a city hotel. Although nothing wrong with it the slick modern bathroom did not match the log cabin and cuddly toy approach in the main room. The restaurant: The restaurant (bar and lounge) overlook the water and when eating in the restaurant the view is a fabulous place to watch the ships and seals. The dinner menu itself I was not so impressed with. I ate once in the restaurant and struggled to work out what was being described (that could be down to me being English and not familiar with the terms) The food I did have was however very good but I didn't return as it is of a higher class of food and far to fancy to eat regularly. Breakfast has a good choice of foods with a good continental option - but be prepared to wait to be seated! The service is not as efficient as in the evening... Room service: efficient, tasty food - my only complaint is that there is not anything light like a sandwich on the menu, 18% tip plus $2 charge is added for each order. Hotel in general: I have encountered more friendly and efficient staff in other Seattle hotels - they are not bad but I felt at times I was an inconvenince to them. The general decor and facilities are good however the corridors upstairs are in desperate need of a revamp - the carpets are tired the mustard paintwork makes them look worse than perhaps they are. The woodwork is chipped and battered in places and so this is probably the worst area. The business 'suite' is a small cupboard in which you do not want to spend too much time - there is a gym which from what I could see was very busy but not used by myself. Location: fabulously placed on the waterfront , however slightly out of town if you like walking - although they do offer a suttle bus to in to town. The cruise ships are right next door so you dont want a room overlooking that as all you see is the side of the cruise ship. The rail tracks do run close to the hotel but I had no trouble with the noise that some had reported - maybe just luck or that I am used to train noise. Overview: I would not be unhappy to stay here again although would probably select other hotels in Seattle over this one. It is clean and comfortable and the waterfront views are definately its best feature.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20122355">Lodge-like hotel. Cozy, comfortable rooms, right on the waterfront, with fireplace and balcony extending over the bay. A beautiful view of Elliott Bay and Olympic mountains. The lobby and all dining areas have a gorgeous view. Just go in the winter -- it's too warm to use the fireplace in Sept. The service in dining wasn't the best, but the scenery being enjoyed made up for it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19764604">Like some other reviewers on the site, my boyfriend and I ended up at the Edgewater after bidding for a 4-star hotel in Seattle. We both really enjoyed our stay. The room, although on the small side, was well-appointed, with comfortable linen, a cozy fireplace, a cute teddy-bear on the bed, and a wonderful bathroom with spa toiletries and a rainfall shower-head. If possible, get a room overlooking the harbor since the view is breathtaking and the best part of the hotel. The location was great since many of the famous landmarks in Seattle are within walking distance. The one thing I would watch out for is the cosly parking fee, which comes out to almost $32/night for overnight parking plus tip. That said, I would definelty stay here again, sans the rental car.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19585024">The hotel is a glorified Motel. We stayed there for 5 days without a single nights sleep. The MOTEL sits right by commercial railroad tracks. All night you hear screatching tracks and train horns.

Similar to previous reviewers, we were also offered an upgrade to a king size room with a water view for 50 dollars more. We declined to pay the extra money, and ended up being put in a king-sized room with a water view anyway (for no additional charge)! The room was cute, with log cabin-esque furnishings, a gas fireplace and a balcony over looking the water. The bathroom was sparkling clean and quite fancy. The lobby and lounge had gorgeous seating with huge windows on the water...perfect for watching the sun set. Hotel is within walking distance of the wharf restaurants/bars and Pike's place market. It is also pretty close to the Space needle (walking distance for us). Staff was exceptionally friendly and we didn't have to pay for our valet parking (don't know if that was a glitch on their part or not). Highly recommended at the priceline price, however, many rooms face right on the parking lot/driveway...which would really be a bummer if you were paying full price.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19094739">I decided to stay at this hotel after hearing from a work colleague that it was a great place to stay, on the waterfront in Seattle. Before booking my stay, I checked out the website. Talk about misleading pictures, etc. When I got to the hotel on a Sunday afternoon and checked it, I was immediately disappointed when I got to the hotel hallway where my room was. Very dirty.... reminded me of an old college dormitory. My hotel room, which did not overlook the water, but rather the train tracks, was small, but clean... no drawers for clothing, no desk to do some work. Additionally, the hotel was loaded with folks who spent all weekend at Hemp Fest. Would NOT recommend that you get fooled by the website. I heard from a lady that I met in town at dinner that she highly recommends the Inn at Black Market or The Alexis..... I only wish I had met her earlier as i think I would have had a different Seattle experience. There's always next time. Don't waste your money at The Edgewater.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19044104">we thought the service was fair. the location good if you want to walk to pikes and the wharf area. we however do not trust the management as they try to add an additional 150 dollars to our bill after we had checked out stating that we smoked in the room which is completely FALSE. there is also no parking in the area and you are forced to pay for valet parking. i understand that a lot of hotels are trying to squeeze money out of customers thinking that we wont notice but this is so blatantly ridiculous<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18805040">Overpriced - Noisy Location - Mediocre service. I've stayed at much nicer hotels in bigger cities for far less than this hotel. We flew into Seattle for a romantic weekend and attracted to the hotel's unique location we thought we would splurge and stay at the Edgewater. The room was nice, well decorated but nothing impressive. The room was small, a coffee table and two upholstered chairs were crammed at the foot of the bed. The small balcony was dirty (lots of dead bugs) with only a flimsy divider between ours and the next room's balcony. The balcony overlooked ... cruise liner decks and stateroom balconies! The noise of the cruise liner's engines, their bells, loudspeaker announcements and the hustle and bustle of the people boarding them right outside our window from dawn to dusk, did not make for a pleasant stay. We tried to order breakfast in bed. Room service took forever, they got our order wrong and the Hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict was cold and congealed. Their muffins tasted store bought, not fresh. Their coffee was blah! Had the hotel cost $90 or $100 a night I would've put up with it, but for $400+ No way!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18743348">2 adults in early 50's for 3 night stay on priceline bid July 29-August 1, 2008. The location was excellent as we walked to pike market, space needle and pioneer area of town, never needed transportation. We did do a sightseeing tour of Seattle as well. We received a room on the 1st floor and were upgraded to King Bed no charge, we were offered to upgrade to waterfront for 50.00 per night but declined. The hall way was dark and there was a musty smell but once we opened the door to our room we were very happy. Although on the first floor we could not leave our curtains open as people are always walking by we only needed the room for sleep as we are out all day long and evening. There are train tracks nearby so beware you will hear the train blow and it is loud, I heard it at 3:10am one night and then the next nights I did not hear it, I am a very light sleeper and my husband did not hear it at all but he sleeps like a log. The waterviews from the lobby and lounge are so nice we sat and had happy hour one day and used the lobby lounge to look out at the water so no need for the extra cost of a waterview room. The weather was also on the cool side so would not have sat outside anyway. I loved the washroom in the room it was awesome, every time I entered it I told my husband how much I loved it. The bed was comfortable and had a nice TV. We did not unpack and there was very limited drawer space. We also had robes in the room which was nice. Overall for the price we paid I was pleased. I do not think this hotel is good for families as it is unique for its decor.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18719293">We absolutely loved our stay here. The fireplace and teddy bears in the room make it very charming and a peaceful room to come back to after a long day of exploring. The bathrooms are well appointed with a nice sink, tilework, and a terrific rainfall showerhead. The location is very beautiful, right by the waterfront and the park with all the statues. Even Seattle Center and Pike Place Market are a short stroll away. We would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18152264">My husband I stayed at the Edgewater on our recent visit Seattle. We booked the room through a travel agent and was not sure what to expect. The outside of the hotel is not much to look but the room we stayed in was spectacular. Wow, what a view. We had a waterfront room with a private balcony overlooking Elliott Bay. All we heard were the occasional seagulls. In the evening the sunsets were breathtaking. You could see all the sailboats, cargo boats, tugboats, etc cruising in the bay. We had a view of the Olympic Mountains to one side and downtown Seattle on the other. I dont know about the other rooms but ours was "perfect"!! However there is one note I would like to add that the first day it appeared the commons areas of the hotel were a little dirty (maybe due to high occupancy) but the next day everything was clean and tidy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17976127">Booked through Priceline, $122 including fees (offered $100). Arrived at 12:00pm, our room was ready. Offered the $50 upgrade at the front desk, opted to see our 4th floor City View room first. Our City View Room was small but doable. After passing a Waterview room that was being serviced, we fell in love and called down and asked if we could have that room, they were only too happy to oblige. The hotel front desk staff were absolutely wonderful as well as housekeeping and the housekeeping manager. THEY NEED A NEW BARTENDER! This guy had to be the worse bartender I have ever dealt with. I still do not know why I tipped him. Two draft beers....doesn't sound too complicated, he poured the wrong beers AND overcharged us. Really, how hard could that be. How many people in the bar...including us? A total of 6...all drinking drafts. He was rude, cold and should be behind a desk...not dealing with the public. Avoid the bar at all costs. (I did overhear a waitress talking to a manager saying her table was also overcharged for their drinks.) One last thing, noticed when I arrived home, I had a minibar charge on my bill. Which meant I was once again calling to dispute a charge. Seemed odd to have to dispute two different charges from a hotel I was at for less that 24hrs. Regardless, the rooms are beautiful but beware, if you go when a cruise ship is in town, you may have part of your view blocked.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17855670">I read a few reviews from people who booked the Edgewater hotel through Priceline, so I was a little nervous. Fortunately, our experience was very pleasant. Knowing that the hotel charges $28 for valet parking per 24 hour period, we decided to go ahead and arrive early and park the car for the day and just walk around downtown. When we arrived around 1:00 we told the valet that we hadn't checked in yet but could we park, they were very nice and accomodating. We went ahead and went to the front desk not expecting to check in, but got our room reserved and everything. The service was very friendly and I didn't get any "attitude" about booking through Priceline. We were offered an upgrade to a water view room for $50 but declined. (Another reviewer mentioned the spacious lobby with fabulous water views - I agree that between the VERY comfy lobby, lounge, and dining area there are plenty of places to sit and stare at the water if you want to so you don't need a water view room). There were no rooms ready, but we were told that there was only one party ahead of us and that they would call us when the room was ready. No problem, since we weren't expecting to get in early anyway. We were called within an hour &amp; given access to the room. We went ahead and took our luggage up to check it out. It was room 407 facing the city. For a "non" premium view, we had a very nice view of the city including the space needle. Of course, at the Edgewater you are pretty much "below" the town, so it's not like you have this huge 360 degree view, but looking at some of the photos of dumpsters from another reviewer, this was definitely better than that and quite pleasant. The room was quite small, but cozy and comfortable. Neat bright red painted bathroom with black &amp; chrome accents. Nice "rain" shower, good smelling soap/shampoo, etc. Upscale amenities. Fridge, small TV, nice ice bucket &amp; glasses. Comfortable bed &amp; pillows. I think it would have been TOO small for more than a night or two, but for one night it was fine. The most attitude we got was from the bartender at the lounge. And some of the lounge patrons were a little chichi for me, but it was still a nice night out with hubby. Negatives: the elevator floor was dirty - it had dark stains on the carpet and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed. I noticed this more the day we checked out so maybe it was just especially trafficked over that 24 hour period. Postives: definitely a good deal for $135 on priceline ($110 bid plus their service fees). Easy walk to Pike Place Market, waterfront, fairly easy walk to downtown shopping district.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17660389">My husband and I visited Seattle for the first time in Dec. 2006. We were celebrating our 1st anniversary - and we had an amazing time. The Edgewater was perfect!!! The staff was one of the best I've ever experienced. The hotel runs shuttles around town every hour during the day, so if you don't want to walk, you just head downstairs on the hour and off you go! All we did was tip the driver, which we loved doing because they were great and full of information - they even made us reservations at a local restaurant while taking us shopping, they just called someone at the hotel and gave them the info! We enjoyed walking to nearby restaurants, and even enjoyed the walk to Pike Market - although I wouldn't recommend walking to older folks as it is fairly good distance (we aren't in great shape ourselves but it was a pleasant walk). We had a waterfront room, on the 1st floor, which is interesting in the winter! We had waves crashing right on us basically - but we loved it! We probably could have moved higher up if we didn't enjoy the crashing waves, but we never asked. During our stay we had a problem with the TV. Within minutes the repair man was there fixing it and they even bought us a movie for the "inconvenience". The ambiance is wonderful for a winter stay. We loved the entrance with the huge fireplace, and really loved the rooms. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17480606">We bid on Priceline at $125 a night (2-night stay end of June). On our arrival, at our request, we were cheerfully upgraded to a room with a king bed, and (not at our request) to a room with a balcony. We werenâ€™t offered a $50 upgrade to a water-side room as others have commented on. We had a view of the top of the Space Needle from our city-side room. Train noise is loud on the city side so be aware if this kind of noise tends to bother you. We kept the patio door /windows closed at night and the trains didnâ€™t bother us at all, although we are sound sleepers. I agree about the curtains â€“ some sheers to allow light in but maintain privacy would have been nice. The Adirondack chairs on the small balcony were comfortable. Noticed a cruise ship docked pretty darn close to the southern part of the hotel, which I would imagine would be startling when you open your window to enjoy THAT water view! (There are a lot of cruise ship travelers staying at the hotel before and after cruises.) The front desk staff, valets, and maids were all very friendly and helpful (especially the maids â€“ every one we passed had a cheerful smile). Werenâ€™t very impressed with the bar/wait staff. I asked if the bartender knew how to make an Italian margarita and was told no â€“ wouldnâ€™t you expect a bartender to have access to a drink recipe book? Making drinks IS his/her profession, isnâ€™t it? I was asked if I knew what was in it â€“ Iâ€™m sorry, but if Iâ€™m paying $12 for a drink, I donâ€™t think I should have to direct the bartender on how to make it. My husband said the clam chowder was good but not highly exceptional. That was the only meals we at the restaurant. The rooms are small but I thought they were comfortable â€“ had everything you needed. We didnâ€™t try the gas fireplace. My husband thought the bed was uncomfortable, but I thought it was fine. In fact, I slept better in the bed at the Edgewater than in the bed at the Liberty Inn we stayed at the next 2 nights (Dupont). I think the location is better for leisure travelers than business people--It's walkable distance to many tourist attractions and good restaurants. Minibar prices are extremely high, as is the parking fee ($28 for overnight guests). Recommend checking out the other parking options mentioned by reviewers. Thereâ€™s a small convenience store a block or two up (Wall). There is a Cost Plus World Market a few blocks away (toward downtown but up a block from the pier road), that has reasonably priced wines. The hotel is very distinctively decorated. The hotel lobby is more like a living room, with comfortable reading niches, a fireplace, and game tables (backgammon, chinese checkers). We had some lovely warm weather while there. I went looking for a place to sit outside to read, and was surprised that the hotel had no outside space for people to enjoy the water/weather. There were some benches on the side of the hotel near the parking lot (over the water and near the Port Authority building), which met the need, although sitting in a parking lot wasnâ€™t exactly the experience I was looking for.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17262440">My mom &amp; I were planning an Alaskan cruise on NCL and booked this hotel based on internet research. It was better than expected and we had a terrific stay. It was super convenient to pier 66 (right next door). Tourist attractions were close by and the hotel staff were very helpful with maps, directions and advise on sightseeing and getting around. We never once felt the need for a cab (and my mom is 70). The room was "cityside". We couldn't see the water from our window but we could see the Space Needle. The lobby had one of the best lobby views ever, big comfortable chairs, tables with board games and newspapers. And stuffed salmon on the walls. And trees. Breakfast was a little expensive but convenient and there were plenty of dining choices a short walk away. The bathroom was so pretty, I'm going to remember it for the next time I remodel my own. Edgewater helped to make my first impression of Seattle exceptional.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17139009">This property upon arrival has some attractive "northern lodge" decor. There is a striking outdoor gas fireplace by the entrance. Check-in was handled well and we were escorted to our "cityside" rooms. (As we were going on a cruise we did not see fit to pay double for "water view" rooms. Since the property is built on a pier, the only place we could see the water was from the lobby, the cocktail lounge, and the restaurant. The hotel sent a car to pick us up from the airport for $42 plus tip. More than a taxi, but we needed a bit more space for 3 people plus luggage. Parking is limited, and the streetcar line is out of service. Buses are available but did not seem to be convenient for travelers to get to shopping or restaurants. The corridors are attractive but long and fairly dark. WIth a scarcity of elevators, we often took the stairs which were old and unattractive. The bathroom was the most striking feature of the rooms, with a stone shower and two shower heads (no tubs). We found it rather odd that the only closet in the room was inside of the bathroom. There was no auxiliary source of heat in the bathroom which is a touch we like when getting out of the shower. The entertainment center/armoire had a few drawers for storage, but not enough for 2 people. In both of our rooms, the doors on the entertainment center would not stay open. (ever hear of shims?) We were rather baffled by the heating controls for the gas fireplace which we understood was the main source of heat in the room (cool nights so we did use it). The upholstered chairs seemed a bit worn but were comfortable. The lighting in the room was really not adequate if you wanted to read. The beds were comfortable enough and had nice pillows. Linens and towels were adequate. There were not enough hooks for towels or clothes. House brand toiletries were OK and a quality toothbrush was provided upon request. While we were advised in several places that there had been two restaurants in fact there was only one with entrees that started at $26 and most were far more expensive. We only ate one meal there given the cost. Breakfast would have run a minimum of $15 had we chosen to eat that there. Room service while not tried was expensive. No other restaurants were within comfortable walking distance. A coffee shop at the Victoria Clipper pier next door but only open M-F is within a half-mile and a good value. While we enjoyed our stay, I'm not convinced it was worth the price we paid.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17034384">We spent three nights at the Edgewater in downtown Seattle. We bid for the room on Priceline and got a great deal at $110 a night, considering their room rates were posted at over $350 a night. Check-in went very well. Because we purchased the room on Priceline, we were given a very small room with a single queen bed. Since there were just two of us, it was perfect. Our only complaint was that the room did not have a dresser or enough hangers in the closet for us to unpack our suitcases. We were given a city view, overlooking the Space Needle. No complaints about the view, but we could've done without the train across the street, blowing it's whistle at 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. both mornings! We ate appetizers in the restaurant one evening and had breakfast one morning. The food and service were excellent on both occasions. We walked everywhere and felt safe, even after dark. Pioneer Square, Pike's Place and the Space Needle were all within a 10-30 minute walk. Unless you plan on leaving the Seattle downtown area to sightsee, you do not need a car. A free bus stops in front of the hotel and runs every 20-30 minutes. If you do have a car, they charge $28 a night. We would definately stay at this hotel again, and would highly recommend it to our family and friends.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR16392187">Booked this hotel through Victoria Clipper.com!

It is an above average property, but nothing really deserving of the (to me anyway) high rates. I was there for a business conference, so my room was paid in a group by my company, but I would have probably tried priceline, etc, if I had been making the call. I must have been in the same room as the previous review (405?) because we had all the same problems with the fireplace, train noise, etc. We brought some of our own wine and put it in the mini-fridge, used the hotel wine glasses. The next morning after returning from breakfast, our room was made up, but we still had the same dirty wine glasses. My wife saw the cart in the hall and took a couple clean wine glasses. The mini-bar guy flagged her down and told her that his service was seperate from the maid and that we would get clean glasses later. He also let her know that the wine glasses and fridge were intended for patrons who buy MIMI-BAR wine, etc. Very snooty.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15960436">The Edgewater has been designed as an upscale concept hotel, but the focus was on appearance, not substance. It's worth it if you can get a water view room for less than $100 on Priceline, but it's definitely not worth full price (especially for "city-view" rooms). A little background: I have spent a lot of time in Seattle -- and in hotels in Seattle -- because I have family in Seattle and I used to work in Seattle. I lived in hotels during the week and went home to Vancouver on weekends, so I know Seattle hotels pretty well. I had eaten both brunch and a business dinner at the Edgewater in the past two years, and enjoyed the restaurant and the views both times. So when I bid $89 on Priceline and got the Edgewater, I thought I'd gotten a good deal. In the end, it was a mixed experience, though, much in line with the reviews here. The good: The bathroom. We didn't get a tub (or a balcony), but the shower was quite nice. I liked the dual showerheads, and they had provided pretty much everything I needed in the bathroom (blowdryer, magnifying mirror, etc.). The woodsy kitsch decor. The nice thing about it is that it's meant to look worn, so where the halls (especially) were worn, you weren't sure whether that was part of the hunting lodge look or actual wear. Usually wear &amp; tear in the hallways bothers me; because of the decor it didn't here. The staff. They were in general pretty friendly; we didn't have any problems checking in or out. The bad: The mattress. Hard, hard, hard. At a hotel that lists for Westin "heavenly bed" prices, I didn't expect the Best Western mattress. (Actually, I think the mattress at the Best Western over by Seattle Center was better the one time I stayed there.) The trains. We were in a "city-view" room, as it was a Priceline reservation. We were offered an upgrade to water view for $50 / night, but didn't take it as we weren't tourists &amp; didn't need the view -- I didn't think about the train tracks, though. Combined with the rock hard mattress, the trains squealing by all night make it pretty difficult to sleep. Avoid city-view rooms. The keys. They demagnetize at the drop of a hat, which led to awkward moments where neither my husband or I could get into the room. The desk staff said it happens all the time if you put the key near credit cards or cell phones. Okay, well, where are you going to carry the key if not in a purse or wallet, both of which appear to be landmines of key demagnetization? Management clearly knows about it; why is it not fixed? No other hotels have this problem. The size of the rooms. Teeny, as already mentioned here. We only just had space to walk between the queen-sized bed and the chair. The little things (also quite mixed): The nickel-and-dime routine. If a cafe two blocks away gives me free wireless with my $2 coffee, why can't the Edgewater give its customers free wireless with their $100+ room? If I can park on the street for free right outside the hotel, why charge $28/night for parking? (not to mention I think $28/night is the most expensive hotel parking I've ever seen in Seattle.) Weird layout. For some patrons, the long walk may be difficult. The lobby isn't in the middle of the hotel, like in most places -- you check in and then all the rooms are down a long, long, narrow hallway. The elevator is halfway down that hallway, not near the lobby. So it could be difficult for elderly or handicapped patrons to navigate. The number of people. Because it's on the water it's an event hotel. You'll see a lot of people in the narrow hallways and and in the lounge / lobby. We didn't have much problem with noise in the hallways up on the fourth floor, though, fortunately. No name toiletries. The sort you'd expect in a mid-level chain, not a place trying to be upscale. Also, a very strong, not very pleasant scent to them. They were supposedly from a spa in the Noble House chain (basically the same as generic "Holiday Inn" toiletries). It didn't exactly make me feel I was in a hotel worth $300 a night (good thing I didn't pay that). The fireplace. Nice idea, but ours didn't work. It had a pilot light on all night, but no matter what we did with the thermostat the fireplace wouldn't light. We tried the timer as well and that also didn't work. Trying to sleep across from the pilot light, combined with the train noise and the hard mattress, was difficult. The curtains. Two choices -- completely shut and blocking all light, or completely open and flashing the street as you dress. I like having some light in the room during the day, even while I'm getting up &amp; getting ready, so a set of sheers behind the heavy curtains would have been nice, and you usually see that in hotels, but the Edgewater just had one set of heavy curtains. Many of these are not big things, but small touches that, when neglected, show that the Edgewater isn't an upscale hotel worth the money they charge. If you can book a water-view room for under $100 on Priceline, it's worth it. If not, it's not.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR15722996">I stayed for 2 nights while visiting family. I booked though priceline and after reading other online reviews, I was somewhat pleased with my stay. First off, if you do book through priceline then seem to give you 2 twin beds which were barely long enough for me (6ft) and the heating system is dificult to operate. The fireplace is nice though. Parking is 28/day which is pretty steap and hard to find offsite parking. The next moring we were told we could upgrade to a king bed and water side room for an extra 50 a night. We did and it was a much better room. Great view and larger bed. Just be away the cruise terminal is next door so you might have an alaskian cruiseship in your view for most the day. I stayed at the Seattle Sheraton the following night and for 180 on priceline I liked that hotel much better.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14981192">The Edgewater is a fine hotel built on a pier over the ocean. The magnificent lobby is built like an upscale north coast fishing lodge. That theme is carried into each guest room. We booked on Priceline and stayed Friday &amp; Saturday night while we walked &amp; shopped downtown. The first night we stayed in a city view room and moved the next day to an ocean view room; though the room furnishings are really no different; it was like moving to a different hotel. The ocean view is simply fabulous. Hereâ€™s my plus/minus assessment of the Edgewater. +Great location on Alaskan Way; a 3 minute walk to the cruise ship terminal, a 5 minute walk to Pikeâ€™s Market, a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle or a 15 minute walk to the downtown shopping core. +The rooms are heated with the fireplace and the aura is great. +Flat screen TV (37â€� in the city view rooms and 42â€� in the ocean view rooms). +2 comfortable easy chairs to sit by the fire in. +A comfy ottoman fashioned out of wool in the shape of a bear. +Great linens, high thread count sheets make for a good sleep. +A teddy bear in every room +Funky modern bathroom with large walk in, dual head showers. +Homey lobby with inviting chairs to enjoy the fireplaces and ocean view. +Very nice fitness facility with 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, a resistance device, and free weights. +A complimentary business centre with 2 computers and a printer. -Parking is expensive, we paid $31 per day including tax.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14915407">Be sure NOT to stay at the Edgewater if you made reservations through Priceline. In fact, there are so many better hotels in Seattle. The front desk staff held an air of superiority, and seemed annoyed when tapped for information. The staff is very vocal about letting those around them know when Priceline customers arrive, and apparently, Priceline customers are not awarded rooms on the waterfront even if the hotel has plenty of rooms available. Instead, Priceline customers get the room with a garbage storage and parking lot view (see attached photos - I suppose you could consider this a water view!). It was very difficult to get 2 doubles, again, because we were Priceline customers. Parking is overpriced and inconsistent. For 8 hours, we paid $28 (visiting friends paid $5 for 13 hrs)- apparently, it makes a difference if you park during the day vs at night. If you have to stay at the Edgewater, park on the street for free at night, or in the parking garage across the street. Otherwise, the lobby decor is nice; their use of deconstructed trees as decor is unique. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, friendly waitors, but music is a bit loud and maybe too "modern." The rooms were well decorated, but very small and cramped- and very difficult to find plugs for electronics. The bathrooms are very nice- beautiful stone and glass walled showers- but inconvenient to have the closet in the bathroom when sharing with another person.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14867722">We stayed at the Edgewater Hotel's "Waterfront Premium Room" for our anniversary in December 2007. When we arrived, the parking attendant was polite and courteous. We checked in smoothly and that's where the problems started. 1) The water pressure of the shower was terribly weak. It was not a shower, it was water dripping out of the shower head. 2) The bed sheets were not clean. There were clearly human fluids present. 3) The plug for the bath tub was missing. And it took 20+ minutes for room service to bring it. 4) Constant noise coming from the hallway. I think the room was next to the utilities room - a lot of water pressure noise and consistent beeping sound. It was enough to wake me in the middle of my sleep. 5) TV reception was bad - rendering the 40' flat screen meaningless. The only good experiences I had at this hotel was when I arrived, and the service I received in breakfast. The food was not even that great. I submitted a customer feedback form both online and via writing as I checked out; but the hotel never responded. I felt it was a total waste of money ($500+/night).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14845328">The Edgewater is a great example of Pacific Northwest style. The log fire out front sets the tone for a cosy look that is carried out throughout the hotel. The location is pretty good as you have the Space Needle on one side and Pike Place on the other. It is expensive but I would not say it is value for money. Seattle is one of the most 'wired' cities in the world but the Edgewater will charge you $25 for internet access. We were also woken two nights running by the fire alarms going off. Staff were giving contradictory instructions ('Stay there'/'Go to the fire point) and both times it was a fault. Apparently this is not an unusual occurence. No form of compensation was forthcoming. We were also woken by the Navy one morning who were berthed next door and like a big band and plenty of horns when they set sail. I also had to argue my case about a toll free phone call that they were attempting to bill me $70 for. So to summarise if you want to be kept awake in a lovely looking hotel who will suck the cash right out of your pockets then this is the place to be.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14755814">Our family wanted to spend a couple of days in Seattle. We have four children ages 4 to 9. They had never seen the ocean and we wanted to stay on the water. We all stayed together in one room like we always do. This room was almost 3 times the price of any of the other 5 hotels we stayed in on this vacation, and it was by far, the tiniest. The many hidden costs were annoying at the least. The fireplace looked nice but we couldn't control the temperature in the room. My husband and I slipped down to the bar one night for a drink after the kids went to sleep. The female bartender was very pleasant and helpful. She and one bellman were the only two people in the place that would give us the time of day though unless our wallets were out. I definitely did not feel this hotel was worth the money.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14724841">Great hotel, with a nice relaxed atmosphere. After a long cold day in the city it was so nice to sit by the big fireplace, order a drink, and watch the boats go by. Rooms aren't huge, but very cozy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14676658">I have to admit, when I found out which hotel accepted my bid, I was a little hesitant after reading many of the reviews posted by other travelers. The noise level was probably my biggest concern. When I arrived at the hotel, it was almost exactly like the website pictures. The entrance area had a nice big fireplace and the doormen were very friendly. The lobby area had a nice, beautiful view of Puget Sound. There were 2 fireplaces in the lobby area with board games near the seats by the window. Thereâ€™s definitely a lodge theme at the hotel as there are antlers all around you. If you have children, this is probably not a good hotel to bring your children, unless they are older and know to avoid sharp objects. The receptionist greeted me promptly and even upgraded me to a water view room with a balcony when I asked her if I could have a quiet room. Iâ€™m guessing because they had a convention staying with them, the more expensive rooms were the only ones left by the time I arrived for check-in. Needless to say, I was super happy about having the free upgrade. I read about the stinky, dim hallways and I was pleasantly surprised. The hallways didnâ€™t look any different to me than any other hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at. The one leading to my room was relatively well-lit and did not smell like mold. My room looked like the pictures they provided on the website. It had a cute little, but expensive, teddy bear sitting on the bed. The fireplace was a nice touch and there was a bear ottoman near the fireplace with 2 comfy chairs. The balcony had 2 plastic lounge chairs with a small table. The bathroom was very nice. It had 2 shower heads; one was the rain one, another which was a regular one. The dÃ©cor matched the rest of the theme and was neat. I took a close-up picture of the bath products in case anyone wanted to know the brand name of their products. Their bar soap was slightly drying, but their shower gel made up for that. The shampoo and conditioner were great; the conditioner definitely kept my hair nice and moisturized. The body lotion had a nice smell without being overpowering and also moisturized without being oily/greasy. Having the balcony was super nice. It was a little cold to stay outside, but I put on my coat just so I could enjoy being on the waterfront. I suppose when the cruise ships start arriving in April, the view and noise level would go up a little, but when I was there, it wasnâ€™t a problem. For the rest of the amenities in the room, there were a little refrigerator with drinks inside and a little bar above it for the liquors. Thereâ€™s also a 4 cup coffee maker with Starbucks coffee. There are nice plush bathrobes if you like those. They also provide a good iron and ironing board as well. The hotel apparently also had bikes you could use, but I didnâ€™t get a chance to see what they were like. The shuttle service was excellent. It left promptly at the top of the hour, but you have to make sure you arrive about 10 minutes before it leaves, as it is a popular service and the other hotel guests definitely utilize it. It runs from 8 or 9 AM until about 10 PM. I couldnâ€™t use it in the morning since I needed to be at my conference before the service began. Itâ€™s about a $6-10 cab ride to the shopping area in downtown. If you want to walk, it would probably take about 15 to 20 minutes with a few uphill climbs. I usually walked back from my conference in the afternoon and the walk back was pretty nice if you walk along the waterfront area. Word to the wise, some of the cabbies will take you around an extra block or two to run up the meter, so be weary. If you know you need a cab, call ahead to the bell desk about 10 minutes before. The hotel isnâ€™t in the main downtown area, so it takes them a little bit to get to the hotel. Calling 10 minutes prior saves a little time. The bell men were super friendly and point out good restaurants for you to try. Chris was super friendly and made sure the cabbies were heading to the hotels for a prompt pick up. The in-room food tasted pretty good. The tuna tartar had a good zest and the grilled scallops werenâ€™t overcooked. The wasabi mashed potatoes had just enough of a kick without you needing water to cool down your mouth. The business center was on the smaller side, but you could use the internet for free inside. There was a printer without additional charge as well. If you prefer to have internet in your room, it was $10/day. The gym, again, is a little on the small side. There were 2 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, and 1 bike. There is a flat screen TV, so you could catch up on the news while you work out. They have some free weights and a pulley system. I think itâ€™s fine if you just want some cardio while youâ€™re there. Checking out of the hotel wasnâ€™t too difficult, but I think they forgot to print out a folio for me. Perhaps it was because I booked through Priceline and didnâ€™t have any additional charges, so they didnâ€™t need to give me one. You could check out online if you like.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14668133">We enjoyed our stay at the Edgewater. It was clean and nice. We had minimal interaction with the staff, but they were all pleasant when we did speak with them. Parking seemed a little expensive to valet (I think it was about $20 a day) but there was a garage across the street on Wall Street for about half that, and another time we found a place on the street to park. The rooms were kind of cozy, but that wasn't a problem for us (it was just my husband and me). We would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14245748">Having lived in Washington my entire life I was well aware of the Edgewater hotel and it's reputation. Having never had the opportunity to stay there I was very excited to have the chance to do so for my birthday. Upon arrival of the Edgewater the exterior landscaping and outdoor fireplace are very nice. The interior is literally covered in tree branches and tree trunks. Decor is very Pacific Northwest. I was there using a certificate that I had won at a school auction. I paid an extra $50 for a full water view, even though at the auction the certificate was toted as being the Beatles Room. Not the case! At check-in the receptionist asked if we would like a room with a balcony or a room with a tub. We chose the room with the tub since the weather wasn't condusive to sitting on a balcony. The receptionist said "we want to make sure you have the best room we have". Our room was on the 2nd floor near the elevator, which I typically ask not to be by. The room itself had a spectacular view, there is no beating it! You are literally over the water. The decor was once again Pacific Northwest/Native American, not to my taste but o.k. First thing we noticed as we watched seals play and a bald eagle soar, was the floor vibrated and there was a constant hum from some type of machinery below us. We later found out that we were right above the Lounge. My biggest complaint was "the best room" was above the Lounge, and we were not told there was live music, which was very audible from our room. When I called the front desk they said the music would continue until midnight. We were given the option to move to another room, but that would have been incredibly inconvenient as we were all ready for bed. They did offer to credit back our upgrade fee, and provide us with earplugs. Which took a half an hour to receive. Beds were fairly comfortable. The flat screen tv was not in HD, in fact some of the channels were down right snowy. The bathroom was very nice, and loved the shower. As for the tub, it was never used as it's only a one person tub ;-) I have stayed in equally nice hotels, with great views for half the price. I didn't find the Edgewater all that spectacular, and I would never stay there again unless I could have a full water view. And at the going rate, I don't think it's worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR14101321">I booked this on Priceline for a $100 bid. When I found out where the bid was accepted I was nervous to say the least. Seeing the Edgewater from afar many years ago I thought it looked like a real dive. I called ahead to at least request a water view room which came at the price of $75 extra. We went with out of town guests and so I thought I'd try to salvage the situation by at least being on the water. When we arrived I was shocked. It is a beautiful hotel now. It was remodeled about 2 years ago and it is fantastic. The rooms are wonderful, the view spectacular, the service was terrific and the smell in the halls - per other reviewers comments - not an issue at all. We ate breakfast in the dining room. It was my hubby's bday. The waitress was wonderful and even brought out a little bday cream puff with happy birthday spelled out on the plate in chocolate syrup. Our friends, from Miami, said that would NEVER happen where they live. They were awed by the friendliness of everyone. We walked everywhere, the location is very convenient to all downtown sites. I would highly recommend this location, especially on the waterfront side of the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13636986">Why the Edgewater? They accepted my $95/night bid at Priceline for Labor Day weekend. Great location on north end of the Seattle waterfront. Within walking distance to most of the downtown waterfront, Pike Place Market, etc. Hotel is situated on a pier between the cruise ship terminal and the passenger ferry to Victoria BC. Half the rooms view the water, the other half view city. Rooms are decorated with rustic cabin furnishings and are very cozy with a fireplace. Bathroom is very modern and seemed an odd fit in a log cabin themed room. Our room had a large patio with a couple chairs. Finished a couple bottles of wine one evening in the lobby area. It is very spacious with ample sofa and chair seating. Floor to ceiling windows display a great view of busy Elliott Bay. Returned to this same spot the next morning after making a run out for Starbucks and breakfast bagels. Unless you have time and patience, park at the hotel. We spent a good 30 min looking block after block for nearby parking before deciding to turn the car keys over to the hotel. It is valet only with unlimited in and out access. From someone who does not valet, it was well worth it. Though very pleased at the value, we would not pay $300/night for the Edgewater. Though it is an icon on the waterfront, its age is not well disguised. A water view room is a must. Maybe our room is reflective of the rate, but we expected to be wowed.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13602446">GREAT location: close to excellent restaurants (newly remodeled Elliot's was fantatstic) and beautiful walking/jogging waterfront park next door. GREAT service: bellman offered to shuttle us to restaurants, car always arrived fast, front desk moved rooms quickly when one was a bit noisy (from fog horn/train), bellman got me a cup of hot tea in the morning at no charge when I was waiting for my jogging partner, etc. - everyone helpful and wanting to please. THE ROOM - FANTASTIC: all-new bathroom with slate floors and shower, big claw foot tub, shoji screens so you can sit in the bath and look out over the water; flip-on fireplace with furry footrest, comfy chairs; good size desk with adequate plugs, wifi ($7/hr or $10/day); all amenities in room - full iron/board, coffee maker, hairdryer, lighted makeup mirror; high quality towels, bedding, shampoo, etc.; THE BAR/RESTAURANTS: gorgeous, on the water, great meeting place for business or pleasure. THE PRICE - WOW: just $149/night on Hotwire. THE SMELL? - I was on the lookout for a moldy smell from other Tripadvisor reviews, but there was none. ONLY COMPLAINTS - exercise room was small, only 3 or 4 cardio machines. But it is accessible 24 hours.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11963434">We stayed here right before Christmas to attend a Seahawks game. We thought we would be out of the downtown fray, which was true but there were some issues. The good: Restaurant 6-7 is fantastic for dinner with great service. The atmosphere is very modern and chic and the view is beautiful. Most hotel staff were friendly and helpful. A fairly long walk to Qwest field. Rooms were clean but fairly small. The bad: Cityside rooms are 100 yards from the train (which goes by approx. 3 times per hour) you can actually feel the vibrations. The cityside rooms are also above the entryway and valet parking which make things pretty loud. Definitely need a waterview room unless you are a very sound sleeper. The ventilation in the room sounds like tennis shoes in a dryer. The beds were slab-like. Cleaning service entered our room even though we had a do not disturb sign out. The surreal: Breakfast a 6-7 at 6 am with blaring trance rave music, (literally no staff), a great continental buffet with no serving utensils. Then the music morphs into 50â€™s holiday music and ramps up to house bar music. Hmmmm.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11561573">I'm moving to Seattle in a few months - and am staying in the area every other week or so until we move. I try to stay in a different hotel each time I visit. Two weeks ago, I spent a week in the Edgewater. The first thing that struck me upon arriving at the hotel property is that it is on a pier - it is quite literally on the water - as in above it. Located along Seattle's vibrant, revitalized waterfront it is surrounded by active cruise terminals, ferry docks, and some very nice on-the-water seafood restaurants. My expectations were quite high upon arrival. The valet and front desk service was excellent throughout the week. They have clearly been very choosy in staffing these areas; they are engaging, polite, and highly efficient service providers. The main lobby sets the tone for the look of the rest of the hotel: rustic elegance. The hotel seems ripped right out of a 1990 Orvis Catalog, with rough hewn wood paneling and heavy use of greens and browns and plum colors. A large open fireplace further sets the tone as you head towards the elevator. Upon exiting the elevator, you experience the worst of the Edgewater: the hallways. They are not well lighted, somewhat dank, and seemingly two or three years past the time they should have been completely renovated. Most of the rooms extend down one very long corridor, and the ambience/architecture of the walkway is not terribly inviting. Nor does it seem all that clean, although I never saw refuse or even dirt ... it just SEEMS less-than-clean, likely due to it's worn condition. The rooms are quite small, but well appointed. The rustic theme is most definitely continued into the rooms, and a gas fireplace occupies a fair chunk of one corner of the room. The rooms are so small the king size bed occupies a large portion of the space, with a fairly large, upholsted easy chair occupying most of the rest of the space. There are NO drawers, and no place other than a run-of-the-mill closet by the door to hang close and store your luggage. Among the nicest features of the hotel rooms are the bathrooms. While they are scarcely larger than a cruise ship bathroom, they feature a shower and bathroom floor lined with natural stone, featuring glass and chrome trim throughout. While small, it serves to modernize the otherwise stuck-in-the-early-90's decor of the room/hotel. The linens are of a high quality and exceptionally clean - the window coverings, carpet, and walls appeared to be in excellent repair and were very attractive. Our room had an inspiring view of the Space Needle - at night, it is spectacular. The bar/salon and restaurant are very good. Cocktails are exceptionally well made, and service is great as well. The bar was packed every night I was there, and seemed to attract people from the city - not just folks staying in the hotel. Although I only had breakfast in the dining room, the food was very carefully prepared - hash browns were crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful inside; the fruit was delicious, and the cappucino first rate. Both the lounge/bar and dining rooms take great advantage of being ON the water, with beautiful views of Elliott Bay, and the ferries and other ships cruising by. The wonderful restaurants of Belltown are within a very easy walk, as are the Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and the shopping district near the convention center - and Pioneer Square and many other sites are just a few more minutes away. I was torn between an Above Average and Average rating for this hotel. It is not cheap, and I was concerned/distracted by the dated decor and poor condition of the hallways. However, the service, views, and quaint rooms were strong enough to walk away feeling as though the money was well spent. This is not my favorite hotel (yet) so far in Seattle, but it's in my top three now; and I wouldn't hestitate to recommend it to those who want a real waterfront feel to their hotel stay while in town.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11447388">The first impression I had of this hotel was that the location was quite nice. It was secluded and at the edge of Seattle near the water. Front desk and valet staff were friendly and service was fast. Valet service was $25 a night. When you first step foot into the lobby, you'll notice a wood or cabin theme all around. Not really my type of hotel, but that's ok. It was different and I like places that stand out. This didn't bug me at all. It's made to look cozy with all the fireplaces and woodland theme. When I was walking to my room, the hallway had this stench of sewage. It was unpleasant but not unbearable. I was hoping that this was only for the first night, but the smell remained after the second night. Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that the washroom in your hotel room wasn't very soundproof. So there wasn't any privacy in the washrooms. Although I have to say I love how the washroom looked - Just the style, layout, bathtub and glass shower. They need to do something about the shutting out the noise from the washroom though. I'm an early riser and my husband likes to sleep in, so when I wake up each morning to brush my teeth and shower, it would wake him. Another thing I enjoyed was the view. The windows in the room opened up to the very edge of the water which is nice. I enjoyed the view each morning looking at the boats pass by.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10814454">The hotel location right on the water is what this place is all about. Regretably, renovation work to the waterside facia, meant the comfy lounge area with its open fire's and sofa's had it's windows sheeted off (stayed early November 07). Views could however be obtained from the less cosy, modern bar area. The hotel is in a lodge style, but has a modern trendy bar and restaurant; which despite being opposites, actually attract. On arrival, the expense of the valet parking is eased by a large fire pit. The service at the hotel was great, especially the concierge who knew his stuff. We had upgraded to a waterfront room, as that was the 'whole deal' of the hotel. The room was small, or maybe was so crammed with furniture such as big lounge chairs by the fire and a small desk and chair, that it just appeared that way. The theme was all about sitting by the cosy fireplace (gas fired log fire which was easily controlled). Great just to sit there in a robe with a glass of wine and enjoy the sea view, but not sure how the ambience would of been overlooking a car park and noisy main road, so glad we upgraded. The bathroom was large, with walk-in stoned-tiled shower and great toiletries. Fantastic shower with water pressure to refresh the dead. Room service was poor, food arrived over cooked and not very appetising. Additionally, the lobby areas were looking a little worn and tired, as was the room if viewed with an over critical eye. Very enjoyable however and not too far from the main city shops, albeit a $5cab ride was ideally necessary. Would recommend this hotel if you want a relaxing stay in a cosy room and make use of the hotel views.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10740560">We arrived late on a Thursday night at about 11pm. After a five hour flight and rental car pick-up we were hungry and wanted a glass of wine. We checked in, changed clothes and went down to the lobby area. We found out the kitchen was closed and NO food was available. SO we proceeded to the bar area. The waitress quickly informed us that it was last call and we were rushed and hurried out. Not a very nice impression at all. For the money you expect 24 hour room service at least!! Then we get into our room and realize that we overlook (room 243) the front enterance and valet. So throughout the night we were awakened by the goofing off of the valet people. In the morning it was so loud we called and complained. The bathroom lighting was dingy and dark (nice hot shower though). I went out to open the drapes to get more light in the room and was face to face with someone coming down the outside stairs. SO we had to keep the drapes shut the entire trip. DO NOT LET THEM PUT YOU IN ROOM 243!! Now some nice things, the decor is precious and very well decorated (carpet is stained in most places though). Anyway, the Edgewater sent a survey after and I complained about the same things. The Marriott right down there on the water looked so clean, new and nice that would be my choice next trip. Seallte itself was perfect - great food, people, scenery!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10720641">We stayed 4 nights at the Edgewater Hotel during the end of October. The hotel is very clean and quite different from other hotels in its class. The lobby, bar and restaurant decor is that somewhat of an eclectic lodge style. When you arrive, the drive through entrance to the hotel has an enormous fire place in the valet area. The service at the hotel was great at the front desk, bar and restaurant. We had an upgraded waterfront room. The room was a bit small - or appeared that way by the oversized lounging chairs and the king sized bed. It reminded me of room sizes in Europe. The rooms continued the same Lodge Style decor of the lobby area. The bed mattress and linens were very comfortable. The room had a fireplace which heated the room very quickly. The bathroom was large, but most of the space was taken by an oversized stoned-tiled shower and a separate full sized "club footed" bathtub. The amenities in the restroom were better than most 5 star hotels. No need to bring special soaps, rinses or conditioners. This place has that covered. Make sure you put towels you want replaced on the floor in the mornings. The room has a small refrigerator, but all the space is occupied with the hotelâ€™s offerings. Be sure to take a look at the price sheet in the room before deciding to chow down on the chocolates, chips and sodas. The room also had WiFi for $10 a night. In the reviews, everyone advises getting a waterside room because of the city side noise. I am not sure I agree. The hotel is on the water right next to the Ferry operation to Canada. If you stay on the water side, you will hear waves banging the dock equipment against the dock all night - it reminded me of someone banging on symbols. If you stay on the City Side, you will hear the comings and goings of the cars driving in and out of the hotel - including the occasional train whistle (the tracks are directly in front of the hotel). So, if you have the window to your room open, you are going to hear noise. After mentioning the noise issue to the front desk, they offered us ear plugs. However, if you have the window closed, you hardly hear a thing. Keep in mind, this Hotel is not air conditioned and in the summer you will want the window open. One other thing about the rooms - BE ADVISED - the hotel's meeting rooms are on the 2nd floor and meeting preparations start as early as 6am. If you stay on the second floor, you will be awakened by the noises from people attending these meetings. We literally had a businessman camped outside our door on a loud cell phone call for over 30 minutes one morning. It was very annoying. Do not stay on the 2nd floor. The hotel is centrally located. They offer shuttle service around the area (no airport pickup or delivery â€“ Taxi fare = $35). The Seattle Market is less than a 10 minute walk. Many things to do and see right along the waterway not far from the hotel. All in all, I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10451966">We stayed here before a cruise in 2 rooms, 4 adults. Ages from 30's to 60's. Excellent location for cruiser's, you can walk right to pier 67. Lobby and rooms are more "forest lodge" decor while lounge and restaurant are very modern and interesting. Views from the lounge are great as you are right over the water. For those that suffer from "mal de mar" it could be a problem, but then it's a good precurser for your cruise. Rooms are small with fireplaces and some have city view which are fine but not very scenic. Bathrooms are tiny but fully equipped and stylish.Nice amenities in bathrooms. Very clean, neat rooms. Service was friendly if not always accurate with information. It's a long uphill walk to restaurants and shopping. Seattle has good transportation system though. Be sure to visit the flight museum outside the city.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10360578">I stayed at the Edgewater for 2 nights while attending a business meeting that was held at the hotel. This was actually by second stay at the hotel and while my first experience was not bad I beleive my most recent experience was better. The hotel is located on the waterfront in downtown Seattle and feels like (and is decorated) a lodge rather than a corporate hotel. It's walking distance to Pike Place Market and a few restaurants. Restaurant 67 is located in the hotel and there is also a bar which has a pretty extensive wine and drink list. Unfortunately, I did not have a view of the water from my room but I found the room to be quite enjoyable. The room was very clean; each room has a fireplace; the bed was very comfortable; and the bathroom has a beautiful stone shower. Guests can also find an umbrella in the closest which comes in handy given the frequency of rain in Seattle. The hotel offers wireless internet for a fee. The things that aren't so great include the business center and the gym. The equipment in the gym is a bit dated. Overall, I was pleased with my stay and would patronize this hotel in the future.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10071172">Room #137 (overlooking the parking lot) The hotel came recommended by a co-worker who stayed there "...years ago" (?) (so did the Beatles!) Ah okay....."but you simply MUST stay there if in Seattle!" (they used to provide fishing poles in each room!) Ummm..okay. (which begs the question "...I wonder how many bites #137 got???) It's old, it's dressed up nicely (sorta like your rich aunt Edna) Reservations made from the front desk for the "Six Seven" in-house restaurant didn't materialize (even though it was made from an adjacent room) Our room had a gas fireplace (which unbeknownst to us was the primarily heating source for the room). Off and on throughout the night the sounds of our MD-88 preparing for takeoff blasted in the corner. Generous amounts of hallway, roadway and seaway noise are all included throughout the evening. The Pacific NW black bear country theme was cozy. The bed was very comfortable, with a great selection of pillows. Great cable TV selection and wireless availability. Don't eat the in-room munchies however lazy you get....you can't afford them! A most unusual (spacious and attractive) stone master bath. Fieldstone lined shower and wall-to-wall open stone flooring! Cold, cold (freezing cold if you're over fifty and can't make it through the night without using "the necessary"!.... BEWARE wear your socks!) If you have large amounts of disposable income, stay waterfront (however beware that it's still noisy on the Bay) The most outstanding feature is the Sunday Brunch at the in-house dining room "Six Seven" (as in Pier 67). So what if you can't sleep at night, the food is great ! btw- the soap was pretty good!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10069424">Don't get me wrong - the Edgewater Hotel in Seattle is nice. It is in a decent location for walking to attractions and there are some upscale features. It is built on the water, but bear in mind that, unless you have a view from that side of the hotel, you will have to walk down the street to actually see the water. The view from the lobby was nice, but there were very few places for people to sit and be looking directly out at the sound. There were two major problems with our stay... 1. THE BIGGEST ISSUE - the room attendant or minibar attendant took two iPods from our room. The management did nothing to help and gave us the run around. For us, this was a major issue, We had traveled 2000 miles (in a car from Texas) to stay in Seattle and this put a big damper to our stay. 2. The hidden charges. Add it up - parking is $26/day and is mandatory valet, if you have a car. Tipping everyone from the bellman to the valet multiple times while you are there (if you get your car more than once). Paying for your room itself - even if you got a pretty good deal through Hotwire, like us. The rooms are nice, but they are not worth $300/night. On top of it all, we did not have a bathtub, just a shower. That was okay, but not what we would have expected. The room was small. The fireplace was nice, but we could not keep the room temperature regulated. It was either cold or hot - never moderate. If you are going to Seattle and have an endless budget, stay at this hotel. Keep plenty of cash on hand and make sure you don't take any valuables into your room, EVEN IF YOU LOCK THEM UP OR PUT THEM OUT OF SIGHT. If you do have something go missing, you will most likely hear, "That has never happened at our hotel before." Don't expect the management to help you in any way. The only way I would stay at this hotel again is if I had very deep pockets and did not mind spending a lot of money with little return. On the other hand, if you would rather have a couple hundred extra dollars of spending money while you are visiting Seattle, I would recommend any of the other standard chain hotels downtown, that rent for half as much and have great locations. Go with those and don't waste your money on the Edgewater, if you are looking for a good value.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10033282">Fantastic Hotel, but pricey. It's the only hotel on the water in Downtown Seattle and well worth the price. The restaurant view is spectacular- it cant be beat. Rooms were nice, but nothing spectacular. Staff was accomodating and friendly. Great location. Close to the infamous Pike Place Market.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10013177">This hotel has the best location of any hotel in Seattle. It is literally on a dock along the city's waterfront harbor. The views are simply spectacular. But you pay dearly for location. The decor is a little odd and the interior halls are badly in need of renovation. They have spent money to upgrade the rooms which are interesting, but they've not spent anything to upgrade the interior halls, etc. The hotel was built probably in the 50s or 60s and in some spots it looks like it. But the rooms are nice, albeit a little inconsistent. The waterfront balcony rooms have fireplaces and balconies where you can walk outside and enjoy the spectacular views. They are in a kind of rustic Northwoods look. The bathrooms are simply to die for. Nouveau chic style with marble counters, cut stone floors, big fluffy bathrobes, an interesting table top sink bowl, a walk in shower with thick doorless glass and the best showerhead I've ever used. The kind with a BIG oversized head that's practically like being under a waterfall. But the motifs of the bathroom and the room are in total contrast. The mix is not very appealing stylistically, but they are comfotable. The management doesn't get high marks from me because of the sign that says they want to save water so they will only change sheets every three days and towels only if you put them on the floor. But then the toilet and shower are not low flow and there's no sink drain stopper, so you have the leave the water running for ten minutes while getting ready. So much for water saving...it's clear they only want to save money not water. But they don't return the savings. While this is a very nice hotel in a great location, it is terribly overpriced. I was on a business trip that was prebooked, but when I saw the rate I about died. Waaaaay too expensive. If they would do an interior renovation to clean up the hallways and bring down rates, this would be a spectacular hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8683189">I had recently lost my father so I wanted to book a special weekend for my mom and I to get away. I saw the "Girls on the Edge" package available at the Edgewater Hotel website. I even called the night before to confirm the package. Upon checking in we had to remind them of the package and they told us it would be sent up. After returning from Pikes Market, there was no package waiting for us. So we had to call again. The package consisted of magazines, manicure set, cocktails and a couple of movies and breakfast the following day. When they delivered the basket to our room, half was missing and an old subscription of magazines was delivered. Well we settled for going out to dinner and then return to our girls night in to relaxe with a couple of movies. When we tried to get transportation from the space needle restaurant, that we were told was available to guests to get around downtown, we were given the run around and told a taxi would be easier and not told the would pay for it. So we walked back and looked forward to relaxing to a good movie, but every single movie selection was "sold out". I called down to the desk and the lame excuse I recieved was everyone must be in there room with the same idea, I said this was part of our package, she said she would take it off the bill. The next morning they slipped our bill under the door. The movie was not taken off and it was 250.00 more than I booked it online. I had to negotiate to get it down to 60.00 more than I had booked it for with a terrible disappointment at a very sad time in our lives. I do not reccomend this hotel unless you want to get ripped off!!!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8668613">We stayed here for four day over the Christmas holiday last year.

It was terrible unless you like cigarettes. People with kids need to be very careful. The windows over looking the water open and do not have anything to stop a child from falling out. Not worth the cost of the room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8515376">We stayed at the Edgewater after moving from the Westin (during peak season). My husband had a business meeting in Seattle at the Edgewater and we went out there early with our 1 year-old for a weekend getaway. Since we did not want to pay the $450 a night price-tag the entire time we were there we stayed at the Westin ($250) until his meetings. The Edgewater was more of a walk to many sites than the Westin although it was right on the water. There was also a pot festival going on at a nearby park which brought many undesirables around the hotel so walking places was a pain (and we are generally pretty liberal about such things.) The Edgewater was nicely decorated, clean and remodeled with a very cool, modern bathroom and kind of a lodge feeling decor in the room. The rooms were just too small though compared to newer hotels. The beds were older and not very comfortable. My husband outweighs me by about 50 lbs and it was like sleeping on a hill being in bed with him. The worst thing though was the air conditioner/heater. It was so loud every time it kicked on that I woke up (about every 10-20 mins) and I am a heavy sleeper! It was horrible and it blew very strongly right on the bed. Another sign of the age of the hotel I assume. Also, the hotel makes the appearance of being family friendly, a teddy bear on the bed and a cute furry pig ottoman beneath the arm chair, but really the whole hotel is just not very toddler friendly. This only matters of course to those who have little ones. They dropped off a crib which we had to set-up ourselves and it had dirty sheets that were fit for a full-sized bed. There is an electric fireplace in the middle of the room which is nice but it is hot to the touch. The shower has no door so the kiddo can just crawl in and out and no tub. The bathroom has glass shelves for towels and such but they are under the sink - low to the floor. There is also a tray that the coffee maker sits on in the room- not sturdy. Just kind of a recipe for disaster around each corner. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. I know it is supposed to be the pretentious place to stay in Seattle, but itâ€™s definitely no Ritz Carlton.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8362430">I stayed at the Edgewater during my first stay in Seattle. At over $500/night I was expecting a water front room. Well, I got the water front, but there is a giant and very noisy barge that is currently oocuyiong the space in front of the water front rooms. If you book at this hotel, please call them first and ask whether or not the barge is there. They must be drudging or something... the noise was all day 7am to 6pm. I was able to negotiate 50% off my rate, which was great...but the whole experience was very strange. The restaurant is great...literally overhangs the waters edge with a great view of Tacoma.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8355447">Stayed here in January 2007 and booked sea view room. Have to say overall I was disappointed given the price of the room. The room itself was large but dated. Overall it gave me the impression that it was need of a major refurbishment. The bathroom was particularly dated although functional. The door came off its hinges when first opened, it was repaired promptly. The room lighting was not fantastic and one of the lights in room broke but was not repaired just removed. The actual view from the room was OK although nothing to write home about. Window is just a relatively small sliding window but directly onto the sea. Artificial effect log fires in room with large plasma TV. I did hear that some of the rooms on other floors had been refurbished so if you are staying then ask for one of these rooms. A friend of mine stayed on the other side of the hotel facing the road and was awakened most nights by the freight trains blowing their horns. On the positive side I thought the bar and the restaurant were OK with good views and attentive staff. Would find somewhere else next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8228082">I really enjoyed my stay at the Edgewater. Things are pricey but you do get what you pay for. I had an amazing harbor view room, they hang out over the water and the windows open. On afternoon I hand fed some seagulls! The staff was also great. Everyone I encountered, from front desk to maintaince, smiled and said hello. It was nice to see customer service taken so seriously! The only slight drawback is the location, there aren't many easy walks. The closet places to eat and shop are up a pretty steep hill. The good news is that the Edgewater has a shuttle that will drop you off anywhere downtown (and pick you up!).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8138267">OVERVIEW: as with all of my reviews, I rate the property to similar area facilities not class of hotel in one area vs. same class in another area. Located on the waterfront adjacent to downtown it is an approximate 20-30 minute ride from the airport. Cab ride was $33.00. The structure consists of a single wooden 4-story building located on a pier. The dÃ©cor theme of the hotel is lodge or Adirondacks cabin. Single restaurant and bar. Small Gym and gift shop. Starbucks counter in lobby. Parking is outside, on the property and limited. Downtown is an easy walk (especially if you find the elevator) as DT is located on the hill above. Several restaurants and the famous Pike Street market within easy walkingâ€¦15 min or so. The Beetles stayed here and fished out one of the windows. Photos available. Do get a waterfront view room. Worth the extra. THE GOOD: Rooms are eclectic furnished in the Mountain lodge theme. Each room seems to be slightly different. Size matters here. On the street side they can be quite small. Some (read upgrade) have great soaking tubs. A sliding wall (ala Japanese style) opens and you can view panoramic view of mtns, bay etc from tub. Some rooms have gas fireplace. Large 42â€� plasma t.v. Small desk two sitting chairs in upgraded room. Great contemporary bathroom with rock and some granite. Shower is glass and open sided. Bellman at door on arrival. Great bedding. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant. Mini Bar service, daily paper. Catering service and functions including food were outstanding. Wonderful view lobby. Band in bar. Hotel has free shuttle service into town. Small business center but adequate. This place exudes atmosphere. Food on premises was excellent. THE BAD: Would not recommend this hotel for handicapped. Facilities are small and could be difficult. Noise. There is no refuge. If you have a waterfront you are subject to anything from ship horns to waves hitting the aluminum docks. Restaurant/bar below some rooms could be a problem. On the street side many complained of parking lot and train noises. Occupant above kept me up with late night pacing on carpeted floor. Bring earplugs for good nights sleep. With the sliding wall some people may find their toilet privacy lacking as the wall is basically paper. Lighting in bathroom somewhat dim and short on shelf space. Outside bell service, even when given advance warning of large parties did not secure taxis. Could not decide if this was on purpose or not, as there was always a more expensive limo available parked in the lot. Attitude of the employees (except catering) seemed a bit aloof, especially reservations. That said service was always more then satisfactory except for the cabs and read below. THE UGLY: Bar Service. Downright unsatisfactory, and on the high end, price wise. BOTTOM LINE: This is a great venue, a definite must do. The hotel is campy, nearby most venues, has great rooms and charm and decent food. Wonderful venue for either personal or business events.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8079773">Let me first start by saying that I will never use Priceline.com again. I had never used it before and thought.....what the heck, I'll try anything once! I put in a price of $150 and Hotel Edgewater came back as the hotel that accepted my bid. Well after the taxes and parking ($25) our total room cost was about $210.... The hotel has great views.... but thats it! The rooms are cute, but super small. So small our suitcase had no place to even rest. The balcony, which looked to the south over the ocean was old and looked unsafe. All balconys are connected so you dont have your own, just a little privacy half wall that seperates yours from your neighbors, which means you cant keep your balcony door open all night because it would not be safe. The check in went smooth and they were gracious and nice. Parking was outragous..... Overall, so-so. When I go to Seattle next time I would rather choose my hotel and know exactly what I am getting.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7967183">This hotel is very cozy feeling and is great if you want to be near the water or in the Pike's Market area (only a 10 minute walk). My room was suppose to be a city view room, but when I checked in they upgraded me to a water view room. It didn't have the tub that you see in the pictures, but it had a great rock and glass walk in shower. The beds seem to be very comfortable at least for me. The decoration of the hotel is a little kitchy (sp?), but cute. I felt like I was in a lodge or a place that should be in fhe forest. The fire place was a nice touch, I didn't use it because I was in Seattle on one of those off days in June when the weather was actually great and some what warm. The staff at the Edgewater were very helpful and accomodating. They were able to help me with many of my questions or issues that I had unrelated to the hotel. I bought fish at Pike's market and they were very quick to make sure it was well preserved until I was ready to check - out. I was easily able to connect to the wireless network that they have available through the hotel. The location of this hotel is great for anyone that may be taking the Clipper to Canada. The dock is right next door to the hotel and they will even help you with your luggage to the ferry. Very accomodating. I would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it to people who want to stay on or near the water in Seattle and near Pike's Market. If you go to Pike's Market and enjoy Cheese, there is a great place called Beechers... they have the best soups and Mac and Cheese ever!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR7804025">Great Hotel, wonderful location--on the peer, near shopping and art schools, great atmosphere.

Boutique hotel is in a spectacular waterfront setting right on the pier. Staff were great. Views are breathtaking. Great lobby area takes in the water view and is very comfortable. The "hunting lodge" decor which some reviews take offense too seemed rather tasteful and appropriate to me (if you want bland, stay at a chain). Water side rooms get the views plus added amenities such as nicer bathrooms and flat panel tvs. City side rooms are almost as good but look backwards onto downtown. Major caveat on the city side rooms is the noise from the train tracks which are very close. Trains run all night. The hotel should invest in better soundproofing for the city side windows. Restaurant ("67") also has the amazing view and has excellent food. $26 valet parking charge is a little steep but not out of line for downtown Seattle. A regular lot across the street from the hotel is cheaper. It is about a 15 minute walk to the main part of downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7615239">We booked on Priceline and I was quite shocked that they considered this hotel a 4-star. It just is not what we are used to!! The Good - 1. Nice crisp bed linens 2. Nice views of the water from some rooms, and the lobby and restaurant 3. the hotel shop had some nice things for sale The Bad - 1. The decor is too kitschy for words. Birchbark print wallpaper. Bears on lampshades. Every stick of furniture made from raw logs or antlers. 2. Weird musty smell 3. Valet parking is a total ripoff and unneccessary 4. Charging for wireless internet 5. Very pricey restaurant 6. Lasting impression of the Manager at the front desk was of bra straps and weird panty lines - not professional-looking! 7. Rough stone tile floor in bathroom - no way it could be kept clean - a haven for yucky stuff like maybe plantar wart viruses! 7. Way too expensive for what it is - a motor hotel trying to pretend it's a first-rate hotel Might be a problem for some...

The room design makes you want to stay there. Great bed with lots of pillows. The sitting area with the fireplace could not be more relaxing. Best toiletries ever and a very comfortable bathrobe. Rooms with bears are the best! Cons: City view rooms are pretty much parking lot view and those in the ground and the first floor have people passing next to your window all the time. This makes you feel you're in a cheap motel. Walls are very very thin and you can hear other rooms conversations, tv, and what not.

It's a wooden framed and floored hotel with paper thin walls and you can hear everything and everyone around, above, below and in between. Literally was kept awake all night with slamming doors, toilets flushing, phones ringing, people coughing, people walking in the room above, a metal pier outside the room with large metal drums banging against it with the waves, did not have enough hot water to half fill the claw footed tub, and to top it all off, at 6:00a.m. Sat. morning the wait staff began setting up a conference room directly across from our room for a morning breakfast. They banged the chairs, tables and dishes for an hour then the attendees arrived at 7:00 and proceeded to greet one another, talk on cell phones right outside our door. We complained, received a release from our reservation, and moved to another hotel. And imagine...all of this charm for a mere $500.00 per night plus $10.00 for internet connection and a whopping $26.50 for parking per night. What a deal!

Overall its an adaquate property, but it was the little things that added up to a disappointing stay. The "biggest" little thing was having no hot water for the shower. However, after 30 minutes, the maintenance / repairman rectified the situation. Our room rate was also inaccurate at the time of check out. We had confirmed a package rate which included valet parking. Upon check out - our roorm rate was $100 more and their valet parking fee was also added on to our bill.

The food in the restaurant was pricey but the impeccable service made it all worth it! The bell staff graciously accommodated our request for the complimentary shuttle service to Pikes Market. We spent a total of 6 nights at the Edgewater and we have nothing to complain about. We also found the Edgewater to be within walking distance to downtown and a number of good restaurants.

It's no fun having a view of the parking lot with a city side view or only some of the water with a partial water view room. The hotel rooms have been redecorated/remodeled during the past year. Some rooms have very nice bathrooms with a shower, slate floors and claw foot bathtub. These are very nice. Open the sliding doors to the bathroom and view the water while taking a bath. The hotel is pet friendly which is great if your little friend is with you. Our dog loves it! The room has a fireplace and the entire setting is very romantic. The waterfront is wonderful to watch, there is continual ferry traffic, some merchant ship traffic and on some days, there may be multiple cruise ships. Sunsets can be gorgeous over the Olympic Mountains in the distance. If you do stay in a city side room, either eat in the hotel or have a drink in the lobby, there are very large windows with a view of the water. We've stayed at the Edgewate for 10 years and have always found the entire staff to be very helpful and friendly. The hotel charges to park your car in the lot in which is a bit of a rip off. The hotel is pricey but well worth it for a nice getaway.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5880640">The main reason for our trip was to see the Mariners play baseball. Yes I'm being serious. We arrived early and they already had our room ready. We paid $20 more per night and up-graded to the ocean view. Man was it worth it. We slept with the window open every night and never got cold with the blankets they provide. Happy hour in the hotel bar is a must,(great prices.) The shower in the bathroom was nice and they provded the best hotel bar soap I have ever had. I only wish that they sold it in the store or online but they dont.

The view from the sitting area in the lobby is fantastic as is the view from their restaurant, Six Seven. My room was small--New York City small, and I'm not into the rustic, log cabin look, but whatever. The gas fireplace which also serves as the heat source for the room is a nice touch, but it wasn't cold enough to use it. My room overlooked the porticochere with a view of the parking lot and the railroad tracks. Yes, I said railroad tracks. For those who like to sleep when they're visiting a hotel, know that the trains do run through the night. And yes, they are loud.

We ate breakfast there 2 days and we order room service and the food was excellent, even though a little pricey. The room was decorated in a cute lodge motiff and it was comfortable. The bed and linens were excellent. The hotel has a shuttle that will take you anywhere in the dowtown area which was great. We parked our car and didn't move it for 3 days. There is alot to see and do in the downtown area and we either walked or took the shuttle.

While I was impressed with the staff and the facilities the rooms leave alot to be desired. The renovation going on was very distracting. Specifically: We arrived early to check in our room because my husband was not feeling well. Our room was not ready yet so the desk staff generously gave us a coupon for two free drinks to be used in the beautiful bar while we waited. The dining area, bar and outdoor cafe area have a view of the water that can not be matched. The food was excellent. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast there. The hotel lobby has a large sitting area with floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and library area where there are comfotable chairs and tables with games nearby. You could spend an afternoon there reading a book or watching the ferry boats go by with no problem. The hotel is renovating many of the rooms on the first floor. When we were there it meant noise and chilliness in some areas because doors were left open because of painting etc... This work should be made clear on the hotel website so a person is aware of it before making a reservation. We had a standard room that faced the city $239 a night. The room was so small there was barely space to walk around the bed on either side. As another reviewer pointed out - the city side rooms face the rail road tracks. The trains went by from 3:00-4:00 a.m. the noise is very intrusive. If you must stay at the Edgewater I would suggest spending the extra money at least ($75-150) for an upgraded water side room if you really want to stay there and have a special experience . An alternative I would recommend is book a night(s) at the Residence Inn on Lake Union and enjoy a meal at the Edgewater. The Residence Inn is 5 minutes away from the Edgewater, is also on the water/marina and by bidding on Priceline I was able to get a room for between ($90-100). Dukes Chowder House across the street from the Residence is a great place to enjoy a view of the lake and watch Sea Planes depart.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4951155">We stayed here the second night of our honeymoon! It was fantastic and we both loved it!! Room was small but cozy with one of the best views I have ever seen!! Nice deck and fireplace and so relaxing and quiet. Wonderful gift shop downstairs and awesome lobby. We got a great deal through Hotels that included a waterfront view, parking and a full delicious breakfast which could either be room service or at the hotel restaurant on directly the water!! It is a great location, a nice walk to many attractions and restaurants. We walked to lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory. The staff was a little snooty, but not rude. The concierge was great and recommended an awesome sushi restaurant for dinner. Sushi was very fresh, they had a tasty and creative martini menu, and a good, free, live 3-piece jazz band playing. We took the hotel's free shuttle there and took a very pleasant evening stroll back to the hotel after dinner. The next day we flew to Hawaii, but have often said we also could have spent our whole honeymoon at the Edgewater.

Location is a bit outside the centre up some very steep hills (NB if you are walking). Expensive restaurant (but of course you don't need to eat there. I stayed at this hotel for six days and got a relatively good rate via one of the aggregator websites. I don't know if I got a particularly small room because I wasn't paying full rate - cannot tell because I didn't see the inside of any other standard rooms. Generally I was very pleased and this review would have been a 4 or 5 star one. But hotels like The Sorrento like to tell us that it is the little details that differentiate them. Sadly my whole view of the hotel turned around within the space of a few minutes. I had made a specific point of enquiring about using the complimentary shuttle car the day before I needed it to take me to the train station. I was told explicitly that I needn't worry and I couldn't book it ahead of time, I should call back a few minutes before needing it and there wouldn't be a problem. So the next day I called up half an hour before required to try and book the shuttle only to be told that it wouldn't be available for a few hours as the car along with many others was need for a very high value client activity. So my Â£850 is for my stay wasn't important enough for one short journey. Up to that point The Sorrento would have featured on my list on a return to Seattle but I'm afraid that one "small" incident knocks them off my list. There are undoubtedly many fans of The Sorrento - I'm not now one of them.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116486396">After staying at one hotel in Seattle, then spending two nights in Olympic National Park, my wife and I stayed at the Sorrento Hotel for two nights. We stayed in a junior suite (Room 400), which was very nice -- large and well decorated. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very spacious. The room also had nice couches where we could relax and watch television on the nice HD television. We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel even provided us with chocolates and a bottle of wine! While staying at the Sorrento, we ate lunch at the hotel restaurant (The Hunt Club), which was very good. Even though I wanted an item that was not on the menu, the chef whipped it up for me anyway - quite impressive! The only downside, if any, was that the hotel just far enough from downtown and the water that it makes the walk back and forth somewhat of a pain (although definitely do-able). The hotel, however, has a complimentary (you must tip) Mercedes SUV that takes you within 2 miles of the hotel. Overall, a great trip and hotel. I would recommend the hotel Sorrento to couples visiting Seattle. If available, ask for room 400!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115942463">We have stayed at the Sorrento several times over the years but must admit this year will probably be the last time. It is showing its age and while I once thought it was a nice somewhat quaint hotel that is no longer the case. The location is so-so: for better and for worse away from busy downtown downtown Seattle (on the edge of Capital Hill or in the midst of 'Pill Hill" - near three major hospitals.) There are relatively few restaurants nearby and the one in the Sorrento (Hunt Club) is fine but a bit too old-fashioned for us (and we are in our early 60's). The rooms are fine but nothing special and that is kind of what I would say about the entire establishment...OK but nothing out of the ordinary (plus or minus.)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115773383">Hotel is a beautiful old girl! Updated in all the right ways. Room was beautiful, fabulously clean, luxurious AND the most comfortable bed I've slept on in years(better than home!) Staff is friendly, courteous, and efficient. Food was excellent. Bartender got a special tip from my husband. Although restaurant does not open til 8am -we were happily served coffee, juice and toast before our early departure. Appreciate being away from the "main drag". Best value and experience ofmour full week of hotel stays. We will absolutely be back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR102640471">The Hotel is very nice on the outside and the lobby awsome but the staff just doesnt seem to work together and seemed to be lost in most cases. We got a suite and got my daughter a reg room and i would have paid our price for hers instead of our. the room just seemed out dated yet it was clean. The door to the TV cabnet was falling off and the bed didnt sit even the left side almost touched the floor. And we used the fax alot for our work but thats when it was working and when it was running half the time the faxes would never go threw, the the charge for faxed went from $8 for about 30 pages to $56 lol. the dinner was good for most part but we wanted to have a nice dinner our last night my meat was over half fat with about two bites of meat. Along with that I wonder now what is the sign for that you put on your door that says do not disturb cause it never stopped any of the staff from coming in at all and when they did they only knock once, better hope your dressed. and last but not least put your stuff up before the maids come in or they will throw it away- my laptop cover and my daughters contacts lens and case all in the trash. I could write a book but think I have said enough<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR98566590">Lovely hotel! The staff was very attentive, rembered our names. The in-town car service is great! Rooms are clean with modern conveniences yet the old charm has been preserved. The Fireside room is fabulous and cozy; great for relaxing with a drink and snack after a long day of exploring the city shops and Pike Place Market.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR79654709">Let me preface this review by saying that I did book through Priceline and got this hotel when I bid on a 4 star downtown resort. After being told by Priceline that I was booked at the Sorrento, I checked their individual website and tried to cancel the reservation because I knew it wouldn't work for a family. Here's why: the resort is TECHNICALLY "downtown" but in the First Hill district, past the I-5. HILL being the key word here. Yes, it is totally possible to walk to the waterfront and Pike's Place areas, but it is a very steep incline and you have to pass the I-5 there and back. Now, add a stroller to the equation and you're going to have a not so great time going down and a hell of time heading back up. There is NO shuttle service. NO shuttle service to the airport, NO shuttle service to the waterfront or Pike's place. As my family and I were walking down and up town, we were amazed at all the other hotels that offered shuttle services, it seems like that would be an amenity offered by a so-called 4 star resort. Well, not the Sorrento. Granted, the concierge or valet could dispatch you a taxi, but after paying $35.00/day for valet, plus tip, the last thing I wanted to do was pay $10.00 for a cab ride. And yes, we could've driven closer to the meca of downtown but parking can be problematic and will cost you just as much as our hotel valet fees. The Sorrento is in a "quieter" part of town; however, there is an Emergency room entrance within stone's throw of the hotel. Which means we were woken up only twice by ambulance sirens. Upon check-in we were told we were booked in a queen size suite (of course they don't tell you that all of their rooms are "suites." When asked if we could get a room with two beds, due to traveling with kids, we were told that our "suite" had a pull-out sofa. After previewing the pull out, we opted for the roll-away that they also offered upon check-in. It barely fit in our "living" area and was not very comfortable. The air conditioning in the room is also located in the "living" area and didn't work very well. Which meant that the person sleeping on the pullout would be cold and the persons sleeping in the bedroom would be hot. I would have opened the windows; but they were positioned to low to the floor and having kids, would have been disastrous. The curtain rod in the living area kept falling down when we tried to close the curtains and the toilet "ran" unless you jiggled the handle after every flush. The caulking under the toilet is also cracking away which means that the toilet wobbles as you're using it. There is no indoor pool or hot tub, another amenity that I expected with a four star hotel. The customer service was above average and everyone we dealt with was pleasant. The internet was free but wired. I don't know how "stars' are awarded but this is definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR78545630">Found a deal through hotels.com for $75 dollars off and upon arrival was told we were receiving a free upgrade. Yay! Room was big and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful, but when inquired about the complementary car service to go to the train station, was told they could call us a cab. Was quieter than expected since it is between two hospitals, only heard one siren during the night; but, was woken around 2am by the person above walking around, could hear everything and made it difficult to sleep. The biggest pitfall is the location, the hotel is at the top of a huge hill and if you do not have a vehicle is definitely not enjoyable to walk to at the end of a long day on your feet. Also, was not able to connect to the hotels Wi-Fi. It is within walking distance to all major sight seeing places. There is a cafe across the street and a drug store one block up, also a grocery store a couple blocks down.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR78172191">This is by no means a new and modern hotel but it is so clean, the service is great and it's so darn charming and romantic. We'd definitely stay there again. Our first night we had a queen size bed which wasn't going to work for us (our mistake for not requesting a king on check-in). The second day we requested a king room - no problem - they cheerfully changed our room for us. The $32 per day parking is steep. We decided that in light of that and the cost of a rental car, parking fees wherever we went - we just wouldn't bother renting a car again. Cheaper to do cabs. Wonderful hotel - we recommend it - the staff is great!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72361919">The Sorrento was on a "best list" over four years ago based on the certificate in the lobby. I can understand why it hasn't been on any lists since and it only has its owners to blame. Broken windows (or ones that don't shut), leaking AC units (if you have one), worn and mismatched furniture. The list goes on. We were in two different suites and most everything needs to be repaired or updated. It looks like a historic luxury hotel in the lobby and exterior but sadly it's crying on the inside for some TLC. The staff was awesome though but I wouldn't stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR72342032">Wow, I stayed here for my honeymoon and it could not have been better. Now, my wife and I are not accustomed to luxury so every tiny detail was a pleasant surprise. Ie they change the elevator carpet every night at midnight to display the new day. Also our room had a beautiful bathroom the size of a new York apartment lol jk but it was large with a double size bathtub and marble tile. The service was great extremely helpful and courteous. The only downside and this is not the hotels fault but Seattle esp. This area is very hilly so if u are fit have no worries everything is accessible from walking but if walking is problematic U may want to find a different location. Since I don't mind walking thus is definitely my new go to for Seattle if I ever come back or recommend.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR70293875">The Sorrento Hotel is definitely at the top of my list. Charming boutique hotel with turn of the century charm but up to date amenities. At the top of a hill and a 15-20 minute walk from Capitol Hill or downtown, the hotel was generous with the Towne Car. The service was excellent, the young staff knowledgeable about restaurants, and all apparently emotionally invested in the hotel. Travelocity failed to let the hotel know our son was with us, but we were quickly upgraded to a suite. Thank you Sorrento for a great first time in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR48058969">Well, we were really disappointed. After all the great reviews we really expected more from this place. The pictures look GREAT but it doesn't really feel like that once you're there. It's a very old hotel and I really respect the fact that they want to keep it as original as possible, however it's tiny and dark and not really equipped with any modern amenities. (ie: no ice machines, vending machines, gift shop, etc) We arrived early and our room wasn't ready (even though I called the day before to let them know we'd be early) so we had lunch in the "restaurant." They have a very small menu with very brief descriptions and everything is pricey. The server was nice and friendly and the food was pretty good but I don't know if was worth the price. The atmosphere was dark and old and felt like a gentleman's club so we weren't totally comfortable there. After lunch our room was ready so that worked out nicely. We headed up the tiny elevator to our "junior suite" which was definitely not what we expected either! Very, very small for a suite of any kind. The room was stuffy and the AC doesn't work so we had to open the windows which don't have screens so we had a few insect visitors- oh great. The TV was a joke- totally basic cable with no guide channel, info button or TV guide anywhere in the room so you have to just flip through and hope you find something you want to watch (and all the channels had crappy reception, very fuzzy). The bathroom was adequate- nice sink and vanity, closet with robes, etc. Separate tiny area with toilet and tiniest shower ever (my 6'4" husband was rather cramped). The "suite" area consisted of a loveseat, two chairs and a coffee table. Wow! So glad we upgraded. The king size bed was mostly comfortable, lots of nice pillows that reaked of hotel bleach. There was about 4 feet of space between the end of the bed and the "suite" area so we're talking small here people. Trying to get room service of any kind took a while but everyone was friendly and helpful. The other major con of this place is the location. There is nothing around there that is remotely interesting. Since we ate lunch at the hotel's only restaurant, we decided to wonder around outside to find something for dinner. There was no one around at the concierge desk or the reception desk to ask for recommedations so we set off on our own and were sorely disappointed by what we found. Nearly everything was already closed and it was 5pm on a Saturday! Hello?! We ended up eating fast food because it was the only thing open that looked even sort of clean and welcoming. Not how we wanted to spend the first night of our vacation! We had to leave really early the next morning to get to the Amtrak station and mysteriously the awesome hotel car was gone so we had to call a cab. We were hoping to utilize that car a couple of times to save money but it was never there for us! So, it was a decent place to spend one night but the bottom line is that we wouldn't go back so I can't recommend it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR46980303">I can't say enough about my wonderful stay at the Sorrento. I spent the first week of October there, and I didn't want to leave. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful, and they were calling me by name by day two. One of the front desk clerks made a reservation for me at Elliott's Oyster House, and while I was there, my server brought me a crabcake appetizer, compliments of the hotel! All of the guys working valet were fantastic with directions. John in the bar was so much fun. The room was clean and super comfortable. I was made to feel as if I was the only guest in the whole place. Next time I'm in Seattle, I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37030395">The hotel is an easy walk to the Convention center via Freeway park. Lovely beds and bedding, quiet despite being located in a hospital district, courteous and helpful staff, but overall disappointing in room appointments, and valet parking was a whopping $35 per night tax included, even for guests staying 5 nights. (Non-valet parking really isn't an option in this area). Historical status aside, the rooms and furniture are in need of some TLC. Our room varied in rate from $279 to $379 per night for a "suite" that was cramped on closet and bathroom space for two business travellers. We were left feeling more ripped off than pampered for the price. The Sorrento could really be something with the right attention to detail and value. They would do well to pay attention to the rooms and service available at other "vintage" hotels such as the Sutton Place Hotel in Vancouver BC and the Davenport Hotel in Spokane.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR36803726">We had a lovely small suite. The service was wonderful and very friendly. Food service was great and delicious. Did encounter a weird experience in the Hunt Bar awaiting a table. A definite poke in the small of my back. There was nobody around except my husband at a barstool some distance away. It was very startling. When we arrived home, we researched stories on the internet that mentioned other possible ghostly encounters. How scary and fun. Highly recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR24411832">We recently had our wedding and reception at the Sorrento Hotel. We felt it would be the perfect venue for a winter wedding - and it was. The furnishings and decor are lovely, and the views and terrace added a classy touch. However, the management at the Sorrento was terrible. From the beginning, they failed to communicate with us, not returning e-mails or phone calls. As our date approached, we had to literally barge our way in to see the space so we could get measurements for our florist because the management did not respond to us. We were not able to do a tasting until mere weeks before the wedding (and the food was not exceptional). We also faced what appeared to be either dishonesty or else utter incompetence. There was a surprise fee for the "toast" that we had to fight about, we were double-billed for rooms guests pre-paid for through the internet, and guests were told they had to pay for parking even though we had pre-arranged for their valet parking. The management also told us our wedding decorations would be kept in a particular place and when it was time to decorate, they weren't where the hotel said they'd be! Our family spent 30 frantic minutes trying to find someone from the hotel to help locate the decorations. They were genuinely worried the wedding would start late because of it. Additionally, a family member had to go back into the kitchen to ensure they saved our anniversary cake layer because they did not appear to be responsive when he asked them to save it. Surprise, surprise; the next morning it was not in the refrigerator where he had placed it! It appeared that the hotel would never have remembered it nor found it again. They only spent 15 minutes looking for it after we put up yet another fight. The management also did not help us in any way with decorating or even directing the wedding procession. In short, they did absolutely nothing and the service was deplorable. (We would add, however, that the concierge and front desk service was very good.) We would not recommend the Sorrento Hotel as a wedding venue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23481661">My husband and I recently stayed one night at the Sorrento Hotel while celebrating our one year anniversary. We had been to the Sorrento once before while dining at the Hunt Club, and it instantly came to mind when making plans for the overnight getaway. I booked online at a good price and was worried we might not get the best treatment from the staff, as is sometimes the case when booking non-directly. We were pleasantly surprised to receive a warm reception and great service during our night's stay. Desmond the concierge was very friendly when we checked in and even upgraded our room to a junior suite in honor of the occasion. The lobby was as I remembered, with rich wood tones and an old-world charm, and the Fireside room was a welcome repose after the cold rain. The second concierge on call brought the bags up to the room and hung my husband's suit in the closet, pointed out the room's amenities and was very helpful, as would be expected from a hotel with its reputation. Our room had plenty of space for the two of us, with a full sitting area, desk, and mirrored bar/coffee area. The marble appointed bathroom was separated into two parts, with the vanity and closet in one space and the toilet and shower separated by another door. No bathtub, which made the room feel somewhat European, but for one night it wasn't a problem. The room also came with robes and a CD system that had some great CDs provided by the hotel, which was an extra treat. We did not use the free car service, as we had our own car, and we decided not to valet but to park on the street, which on a Saturday night was no problem and on Sundays allows for free parking. When we arrived back at the hotel late evening there was a bottle of champagne, berries, and a note from the concierge wishing us a happy anniversary. It's the special touches that make a hotel memorable, and we were pleased with all of them. The California king bed was also of note, and although the pillow top mattress was still a bit too hard for my liking the wide variety of pillows and the well appointed bed sheets made the bed a dream to even sit on, let alone sleep. Our suite was in the front of the hotel facing the main street, and while there was some street noise when we had the windows open once closed it didn't bother us at all. We tend not to be an overly picky pair when it comes to traveling, and I'll agree that the Sorrento is not a five star luxury resort, but it did provide a great night of comfort for us during our little trip to the city and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a charming, romantic little hotel with a touch of history.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR23379495">Last night, my wife, Rose and I visited the Fireside Room intending to have drinks and dessert. This has been a two or three times a year, winter and bad weather routine for us for the past 18 years. At least once a year we bring out of town guests. Last night, our experience in your lovely setting was poor in every aspect - shocking to us really - as although we had encountered hiccups in the past, this time something seemed systemically wrong. In no particular order: We were ignored at the hostess station as we stood there surveying the room. There was a hostess standing there but she was more intrigued with what was going on on her computer screen. My guess is we stood there for nearly two minutes without her saying a word to us or lifting her head from the screen. Four suitable tables were open but three of them had dirty dishes sitting on them. We waited awhile longer and then chose one of the tables that was not yet cleared and we consolidated the dishes onto the uncleared tables beside us. Those tables remained uncleared for another ten minutes until another guest (staying with you) came and sat down there - she then partly cleared them herself. The room was cold. There was no live music but there was also no recorded music playing throughout our 45 minute visit except for the last 15 minutes. No water was offered or brought. We ordered desserts. We almost always have one or two drinks each but seeing all the malfunction around us, we chose not to this time. We also noted that my usual order Laphroaig 10 year old was $15 a glass - at least $3 higher then anywhere else in the city. The desserts are fairly priced (kind of a disconnect). Everything was slow for us and for all around us. We heard several customers inquire as to where things were, how much longer, etc. I went to the front desk to get a comment card. None were there. No one came to the front desk to greet me. Three minutes later, the concierge asked me if I had been helped. I asked for a comment card and for your business card. He gave them both to me but did not inquire as to what was on my mind. Huge missed opportunity. Ever since we moved to Seattle, the Sorrento has been a part of our routine. We stayed with you for two nights when we were relocating from California. We have reccommended the Sorrento to a half dozen out of towners and to countless locals looking for a stylish respite.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR23038779">We had booked a room with a hotel that was not opened, so this was a last minute switch.

It went from cold to scalding hot in seconds and wouldnâ€™t maintain a steady temperature (actually burnt my skin) Very strange strong odor in hallways (but not in rooms) Heat did not work in my room (they sent up heater but took 2 days) No clock in room (had to ask for one, which they sent) No sound proof windows; street sounds were extremely loud (sirens, cars, train whistles in early am, even heard what sounded like drag racing several nights) No bathtub in a suite room is ridiculous; only had a tiny shower Not close to Pike Street/tourist area (but short cab/car away) Iâ€™ve given this hotel two chances. Would I stay here again? Maybe but I would definitely look elsewhere first. (W, Four Seasons, Pan Pacific, etc.) The shower burn was a big turn-off and not easy to forget. The level of service is not up to par with 4 star hotels at all but the staff is nice enough and theyâ€™re trying. Half the issue is the building is just old. Half appears to be a lack of anticipating basic needs or informing guests of items. Ie&gt;No bathtub in an upgraded room was a rude shock. Itâ€™s not completely horrible but so much ends up not going smoothly or to guest expectation that it ends up feeling like a hassle. I upgraded to the junior suite on this visit because I thought it would be better than the regular room on my last visit but there was barely any difference and the lack of basics was still the same. I also do not remotely understand anyone rating this a 5 star hotel. Maybe based on friendliness yes, but execution? No way. Not if youâ€™ve traveled at all and stayed at a true 5 star hotel. And they seriously need to work on the water situation. It's not only a hassle but dangerous. What if I'd been someone that couldn't jump out the way fast enough? I moved REALLY quickly and still got hurt.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR21056177">We arrived in Seattle and had two nights booked into the Sorrento to begin our two week holiday in Washington.

It is a beautiful, old hotel that has always impressed us with its level of service. However, this last last trip was disappointing. First, they have changed their car service. It operates only until 5 p.m. on the weekends and the car was not the same as previous years. It was worn and old. We were also told by the valet that we needed to tip the driver because he only was paid by gratuities. Not only was this advice unnecessary but it was unprofessional. No car service meant taking taxi cabs to dinner and shopping because this hotel is not within an easy walk of the Market or many restaurants. We were also disappointed by the general lack of service. In our previous stays, we were warmly greeted and our bags taken to our room where the bell-hop would turn on classical music. Turn-down service was automatic and fresh ice delivered nightly to the room. None of this happened during this last trip. In fact, when we asked what hours the Market was opened we were met with a shrug. If we hadn't been treated so well in the past, perhaps this wouldn't have been so shocking. Maybe this was just a bad weekend but it seemed that the hotel has cut down on its staff and certainly are trimming corners on costs such as the car service. If you are a returning guest anticipating using the car service, just be prepared for the changes.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10081353">I was very impressed with the Sorrento Hotel. The bed was covered in high quality pillows of varying firmness, the sheets were also high quality, and the comforter was similar to the Heavenly bed at Westin. Free high speed internet access was definitely a major plus, as were the free NY Times and Wall Street Journal in the lobby. Although their valet parking was expensive, there is plenty of metered on street parking in the area (meters not read from 6 pm to 8 am). My only complaint was that the room was somewhat small for a hotel of this quality. Although the square footage was probably about average, a lot of in was wasted on the long hallway in the room. The actual living area was somewhat cramped, especially when the pillows were removed from the bed. Still, I thought the hotel was an excellent value for the money, and I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR10008719">This hotel has the most amazing bed and bedding I've ever experienced, it's just perfection!

I thought they might look down their noses at me, given that I had a "Donated" gift certificate, but the front desk treated me well, as did the concierge. The room was lovely, if a little small, but it had a French Press, and the coffee was actually not bad at all! There was a cd player, and complimentary use CD's, including a Blues compilation that I listened to while I took a bath. The bathroom was really beautiful, lots of white and grey marble. The Sorrento offers complimentary car service, and they took my friend and I to Capitol Hill, in no time flat. If I had the money, I would stay there all the time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5881158">I surprised my husband with an in-town getaway at the Sorrento for our anniversary. Although our room was cozy and our meal at the Hunt Club was delicious, I will likely never return because of what I learned after checking out. My sister and a friend each called the hotel to have a bottle of champagne sent to our room. They never arrived. Although there WAS a bottle of champagne in the room when we arrived, it also had a card from the hotel staff, leading us to believe that the hotel had provided it. We still do not know what really went wrong because we've been stonewalled. My sister, our friend, and we have not received any calls back from the hotel to explain what happened with the missing champagne. Even after writing a thoughtful letter to the hotel manager, I have had no response. It is shameful for a hotel of this caliber and expense to provide such poor customer service. It should be a common event to have people send flowers, wine, etc. to hotel guests. Please note that other negative reviews of this hotel have increased in 2006. It was our experience before this visit that it was the place to go for a real treat. I no longer feel that way. Try the Mayflower Park instead...it was a total treat during the holidays. Sorry, Sorrento, you need to go back to Hospitality School.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5829039">We stayed here with 2 children and overall had a good time. We all enjoyed the free car service (though be warned you can't always get a car) and the room was excellent. However the reason they offer a car service soon became clear - its not as central as you'd expect for a hotel this expensive. All the staff were excellent - especially dealing with the serious matter of a lost teddy bear! Happily found during the search. Breakfast wasn't that good but nothing too wrong with it but again not as good as you'd expect for the money though amazingly in this day not a buffet. As other reviewers mention the public areas are strangely dark. There were also very few facilities (eg swimming pool). I would go back - I think!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5729228">The first thing you notice about this hotel is the gloomy lobby. It is all dark wood and low lighting. And forget trying to read anything over breakfast in the restaurant, unless you get very close to a window and, even then, you need a light above you. There is little natural light in any of the communal areas, and this is my biggest criticism of the hotel. The rooms themselves (I was in a regular room, not a suite) are just fine, with an extremely comfortable bed, lovely linens, and nice touches such as real coffee and a real coffee press. The view was of a parking lot and concrete, but when I tried to change rooms they said all the rooms had poor views 'because this is an old hotel'. Like most places, some of the staff were great, and some were less so. When my room still hadn't been cleaned by 5pm one day, the man at the front desk unapologetically told me it was a Sunday and this was to be expected. For $300 a night, you would expect better. A lot of people talk about the character of the place, and this is certainly better than the big chains, but even in August it just felt gloomy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5723362">I spent two nights at the Sorrento while in Seattle on business. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. While not one of Seattle's mainstay luxury hotels, the Sorrento was full of old world charm and a place I would stay again. Upon arrival, I was greeted by the valet and the front desk staff. I was thrilled to learn that my room had been upgraded to a suite on the 6th floor. The room was plenty big with nice ammenities. Staff was super friendly throughout my stay even when I had to leave for the airport at 4:00 AM. I would definitely reccommend staying at the Sorrento.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4716542">The building the Sorrento in is very cool. Its a neat, old historic building. Unfortunately, for the price you pay, the hotel has an overall run-down feel. The night we checked in, there was one valet and one hotel desk clerk and they struggled to handle the 3 people that happened to arrive at the same time for check in. A simple request for some extra help was met with sorry I've only got one guy working tonight. Well for the 350 buck (275 for the room +tax +parking), I want some better service. The room itself was very average. The bed was nice, but the bathroom was really poor. Tiles were dirty and very standard appointments. Overall, this should be a two star hotel that charges 125 a night. For the four star traveler, this was a horrible place and I would not stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR4691129">Wonderfully comfortable accommodations. Other hotels in Seattle on the other side of I5 and are all hustle and flow--Sorrento is not a formula hotel. Genuine warm reception from the lobby bar, front door/valet parking, concierge, and reception desk staff (much better than the Olympic or Sheraton). Even the cleaning staff will seek to assist guests. Room interior appointments were charming and very clean. Will stay there again anytime, might try Room 608, the Sleepless in Seattle room. This is the only hotel in Seattle where I slept well.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3778090">I have stayed at hundreds of hotels around the world and most of the high-end downtown Seattle hotels. Just had my first stay at the Sorrento. I will never go back though I can see it's appeal for others.. Pros: Victorian look. Friendly staff - when you can find them. Small intimate feeling. Great quality food at the Hunt Club. Room Service breakfast was great quality (overnight cooked steel cut oats and whole grain pancakes). Negatives: A/C couldn't get the room temperature below 80F. When we arrived, the room was over 90 F. Cleanliness. Stuff still in the trash can in the room. A completed survey card still sitting on the desk in the room. Aged infrastructure. Toilet ran frequently during the night for minutes at a time. A/C is a window unit not central air. A/C was so noisy (chirps, rattles, etc.) it kept waking me up. I'm used to central air and not window units at high end hotels so this might not be a problem for you. Hunt Club restaurant (was original reason to stay actually). Very disappointed that the service was not nearly on par with say the Georgian at the Olympic Four Seasons (Fairmont now). Expected better treatment, better staff knowledge of their wine list, more attentive service. The food did taste quite good though and was reasonably priced for the quality. For a $250 dinner and $300 night at the hotel, I ended up feeling like I would have rather stayed home. I only managed a few hours of sleep. I've never felt that way before following the same routine at other Seattle area high end hotels or around the world.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3737907">I had my wedding reception at the Sorrento. I also paid to have 10 guests stay overnight at the hotel. We received TERRIBLE service. When I called to complain to the coordinator regarding the service she never responded. I again contacted her citing my complaints...no response. I tried four times, I never received a call back. They totally ignored me after they had my money. My specific complaints: They threw away my wedding bouquet, did not have piped in music as they had promised, no alcohol was given for a toast, which we previously arranged (our best man had to go out and buy a bottle so the groom and I had something to toast with.) They had horrible decorations in the room (think jumbo disco balls on a plastic Christmas tree with fake white snow on it). Decorations that I gave to the hotel to use were never returned to me. The front desk clerk was curt and seemed like she had somewhere better to be. My family worried about my choice in having such an important event at the Sorrento because the Sorrento elevator is very tiny and slow, downtown Seattle is too far away to walk from the hotel and the inside of the hotel smells stagnant- like moth balls are dwelling somewhere. I chose to overlook these details in favor of what I thought would be intimate and romantic. I did not expect the undesirable service. I will never return.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3703278">From the time we entered the parking area we felt that Sera, Celena, Chris and Cisco had known us for a lifetime. The Town car they offer for their guests certainly solves the Taxi issue and the Driver Chris was terrific for dining and sight seeing recommendations.

Super cudos to their management and support staff for making our stay very enjoyable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3635346">We had read some good things about this hotel, ie: their beds and sheets, plus the "quaintness". We only stayed one night, but when we arrived in our room, it was SO small. It had two beds, but there was barely enough room to walk around. We were there with our two children but since it was just the one night as we passed through on our way to California, we thought we could manage. However, when we tried to turn the air conditioning on, it did not work at all, in fact not a bit of air came out and the room was very hot and stuffy. We called down to the front and she said couldn't we just open the window? I told her that I had children with me and since these windows were low, ie only 2 feet off the ground, if I kept them open, one of my children was liable to topple out! She said then, that she would send someone up to look at it and within a few minutes, someone came up and he confirmed that, yes, it was completely broken. Since it was Sunday night, he said that there were no engineering people available to fix it, so they offered to put us in a different room. We were pleased to be upgraded then into a suite, which was much larger, with a separate bedroom. Our kids both got their own bed and my husband and I planned to sleep on the fold out bed in the livingroom. However, when we finally got to bed, this fold out bed had no sheets, pillows or blankets, so we snitched some off the kids beds, but the mattress was SO uncomfortable that we finally ended up putting the sofa and chair cusions on the floor and sleeping there! The whole bed platform was slanted and the mattress was only a couple of inches thick. Really bad. As well, there was a huge wet spot on the living room carpet that the previous guest had made and so we had to be sure to wear our shoes when in the room. All in all, the room, even with the upgrade was not worth it, I would never stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3457524">I was looking for a romantic getaway hotel in Seattle. The reviews on this site really influenced me to try the Sorrento as opposed to say the Inn at Market Place. This is a very nice property with many pluses, but my over all opinion is that it's nothing special, which is of course what you're looking for on these getaways. The Sorrento has an excellent concierge who gave very good recommendations, even when put to the test. They also have complimentary Town Car service to and from downtown destinations. This is a really nice thing. The public rooms of the hotel are top notch. The lobby lounge, for example is warm and inviting. I opted for a Junior Suite which ran around $300 a night. The room is a very small divided into a small sitting area with a tv in armoir and a bedroom that is tiny. The king size bed barely fits in the room, you have to squeeze buy it to get to the bathroom. The bedding was spectacular with super soft sheets and a large variety of pillows. The bedroom had an oversized desk that abutted the bed. The bathroom was nice with white marble and a spacious walk-in shower. Unfortunately, there's no tub in the bathroom and that's a minus for me. So here are there reasons for my average review: The room lacks any special aesthetic. The entire room is beige and boring and feels very, very cramped largely because of the poor layout. The bathroom is solid white. The room really needs the services of a good interior designer. The room temperature was impossible. They rely on small under window units that you just canâ€™t get right. We were either freezing or boiling. There are no views whatsoever. No evening turn-down service was provided, so no evening straighten up of the room either. No coffee or breakfast service provided. Seating was uncomfortable and dated. So overall, this is a nice place, but more like a business destination than a getaway. Iâ€™d say take the $300 youâ€™d spend here and spend it at Inn at Harbor Steps.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126933596">We have stayed more than 5 times at this property now and my last stay on March 1st was extremely terrible.

Back then, having enjoyed my stay, I vowed to return, and to lash out for a high floor (Grandview) with a Space Needle request. However, as much as I appreciated the hotel's location and views, this time I was troubled by the soft and squishy "heavenly" bed. I had a sore back from travelling, and my bed felt too saggy and worn to support my back and body. When I complained and requested for an alternative mattress, I was told that all the mattresses had been recently replaced and I was offered a bed board. I declined, knowing that the only appropriate action I could take would be to vote with my feet and stay elsewhere in June 2012 when I return with my family. I was disappointed to be charged $10/day for a mini fridge in our room (this was complimentary last time), and service express stated that kettles were not available to be brought to our room, whereas Elspeth Jones, Hotel Manager, in response to my previous tripadvisor report, had suggested they were available. We went out and bought one for our convenience. As we're Aussies with different voltage, we had to leave it in the room when we left. It wouldn't have fitted in our suitcases either. The $5 Green Option was taken, but only for one night only. I had misinterpreted the written information in the room and we had still expected at least the trash to be removed and the beds made, but as we found out by experience, the Green Option means no housekeeping, FULL STOP. We had an interconnecting door, that we weren't using, and everything could be heard from our neighbour's conversation, their coughs and their television. I assumed they could hear us too. I hadn't realised that the downstairs restaurant had opened until we were leaving and I was sorry we hadn't tried it. It's sort of tucked away in the lobby, but it's modern and it has a great aspect to the street and the menu and prices looked good. Maybe for next when we will be in Seattle again. Despite the uncomfortable bed and other inconveniences, we still enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere of this hotel and Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR126473266">My family of 4 stayed here for spring break, everything was clean and comfy however the building creeps and crackles during windy nights, we weren't warned before we booked and this was not listed on their website, we saw a managers note in our room, however didn't think it would be that bad... it was horrible.. all you can here is creaks and crackles often, in the note on your desk located in your room, they offer ear plugs! lol..

Check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly. I asked to be placed in one of the renovated rooms and the gentleman was happy to oblige my request. 23rd floor, city view was not a disappointment! The large King bed was comfortable and is situated where you can look out of the large window while in bed. Large flat screen TV, small sofa and chair along with a large desk; this room is one of the best I've experienced for attention to details and going above and beyond to make your room feel like your home away from home. Nice bathroom with deep tub for taking a nice long soak. Plenty of towels, make up mirror, toiletries and there is a list in the hotel room "Book" of items provided if you happen to leave something behind at home. It is the longest list of items I've encountered. Nice closet space with drawers to put your belongings along with a safe and plenty of hangers for your clothes.

Although the room was renovated and really looked nice, I wanted the sea view that the folks on TripAdvisor had raved about. I called the front desk and told them I wanted a different room and the guy told me to come back down and he'd find me a different room. Upon getting there he got me a room on the 33rd floor with a nice view of the space needle and the sea/ocean (not sure which me it was). The room was nice and clean although it wasn't renovated and it was in the north tower. I found the gym to be spacious and nicely equipped with new treadmills and life cycle machines that are iPod compatible. There was always a stack of fresh towels and a rather tiny separate weight room which I initially mistook for the gym. Also, there's no way to get to the gym from your room by taking the stairs. I liked all the "going green options" like getting the $5 voucher for skipping the daily room cleaning. I also found the onsite restaurant and coffee shop to be pretty decent. The location was great for access to the convention center, a variety of shops, restaurants, the monorail, the pike street market, and other attractions.

That is perfect for me because I don't like my sheets changed and don't need new towels daily. I did ask for two things: my bed made daily and coffee for the machine. The first three days that happened. Then out of the blue I was told that since I chose the Green Option housekeeping would not enter the room. I was not going to pay for coffee but I was okay with making my own bed. Bottom line: for me I would have liked those two services and those two only. Unfortunately it was an all or nothing deal. Had breakfast and lunch daily at the little cafe in the hotel. It was excellent!! Internet was good, view out the window wonderful and proximity to the downtown places perfect.

While I wasn't placed in the best available room (SPG Plat), my 44th floor view was panoramic even sans Space Needle and Puget Sound. The location is fine and the operator (Service Express) was helpful and friendly. First off, the internet connection did not work and I spent quite some time with tech support to sort that out. Second, I requested a morning wake-up call and answered the phone when it rang. I didn't pick up a follow-up call as I exited the shower. Shortly thereafter, a security guard knocked on the door and then tried to open it and was stopped by the bolt. Hey, I wanted a call, not a personal rousting. Within 10 more minutes somebody else knocked to pick up a room service table. I didn't have one but I did have a 'Quiet Please' tag on the door to no avail.

I picked this up on Hotwire at a steal of a deal. I am glad I did, because I would never pay the $289 the hotel website wanted. Donâ€™t get me wrong, the Westin is nice. The front desk staff was nice as well. The room was pretty basic, nice King bed, pull out Sofa Bed, decent bathroom, real nice shower head, and a decent view. That being said, itâ€™s not worth $289. There are a lot of other options at lower rates. As someone who loves to travel and blogs about it, I liked my stay, but I am always looking for a deal so thatâ€™s my take on it. It was nice being able to check out via the TV, but it was hard to find that option on the menu with the remote. Since it was a Saturday night stay, we scored some street parking and paid for the meter until 8pm, which saved us about $20-30 easy in parking garage fees. This place has a great location as well. We did hit the lobby bar for first round of some over priced drinks (as expected) but did enjoy the bartender who was friendly. Overall a good stay and really just used this as a place to sleep after a night out of drinking. I would stay again in a heart beat at the rate I paid.

The Westin Seattle is no exception. The rooms are clean and well appointed. Things work. The bathrooms are nice. But, like some of the dates you've had that are nice but don't rev your engine, so too is this hotel. Everything is tourist/business class expensive. That is no surprise as I think that is probably Westin's bread and butter clientele. Parking is very difficult in Seattle and very expensive. This is the left coast and they hate cars. Parking at the Westin is easy and, alas, very expensive, so be sure to get a quote on that additional cost when you price the rooms. The restaurants can have very, very slow service but no matter, there are a plethora of restaurants immediately nearby ranging from truly gourmet dining to twenty-something night clubs to you name it. No reason to have to eat at the Westin if you don't want to. Your just a few blocks from Pike Place Market (it's Pike folks, not Pike's :) ), the downtown Monorail station (takes you to the Space Needle), and ditto for the heart of the city's financial and municipal buildings. And, lest I forget, it's less than a block to shopping including Nordstrom's and Macy's. So, for a great location and no disappointments, the Westin Seattle is a good bet.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122953716">Overall, a disappointing experience for a Westin. I booked here for a few reasons: I was curious about the hotel, I'm an SPG gold, was hoping to get one of the newly renovated rooms, and I wanted to see the view which I read a lot about. The Good: The staff was very friendly, the location was convenient, it smelled nice and the beds were comfortable (as with all Westin's), wireless internet was pretty fast, good view from the room. The room was good size. The OK: The food and wine list at the main bar in the lobby was ok. Not bad, not great, just ok. Carpeting in the common areas and room were pretty worn. The headboards on the beds were uncomfortable (too short and had a moulding that jutted out making it uncomfortable to rest my head against). They use the newer sensor activated dispensers for the mini bar which means that if you pick up any item to look at it - bingo - you are now charged for it and you have to tell the front desk to remove the charge...annoying. The Bad: The hotel is surprisingly worn for a Westin. The elevators look like they are from the 1970's not to mention pretty beat up and worn (the door had dents in it and the walls were scratched), my alarm clock was filthy, the TV in the room had a poor picture on most channels, tile in the bathroom was really worn. I didn't get a renovated room, so my experience would have been better if I did, however the elevators and common areas are still pretty worn.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122703786">After staying in the westin and dealing withe the chronic dry ventilation we suffered severe chest infections and have now spend 2 months suffering with viral infection caused by unclean ventilation, very poor maintenance at this hotel and unsafe for your health<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR122686123">This was just not our cup of tea - to say the least. We payed a premium price for what was billed as a "Deluxe Water View" room with King. That is definitely NOT what we got. We arrived at the hotel and, while standing in line to check-in, I noticed that only two of the 4 people behind the desk actually appeared to be doing anything. The other two just seemed to stand around and direct "traffic" instead of actually helping to check guests in. This isn't a big issue for us but I must admit that it gives a poor first impression. At check-in, we were told that a King was unavailable but that we would be upgraded to a "better" room although it only had a queen bed -- this seemed reasonable and no big deal to us if we were getting a nicer room. What we were given was room #2850 in the South Tower. My wife summed it up by calling it "depressing". We are actually quite used to staying in hotels/motels of the 2/3 star variety -- everything from a Motel 6 to a Hampton Inn. While the "view" down 5th Avenue and the partial views out to Elliot Bay were reasonably nice, the overall furnishing and general sense of the room was, in our opinion, not even a close match to what we expected. It turns out that our queen bed was actually a Murphy-style bed that swung out of the wall -- not exactly my concept of the "Heavenly Bed" that Westin is so quick to advertise! The rest of the decor was plain and (truthfully) a bit dated -- not in a "1960's period" kind of way but in a "we really need to refurbish our units" kind of way. We were lucky enough to have other options and we refused the room, got our money back, and went elsewhere in a hurry. Our Westin experience didn't end there, however. The next day I sent the General Manager of the hotel an email describing our experience and disappointment (similar to this review). No reply... After a few days of no response I forwarded the email to the Customer Service desk at Starwood (which owns the Westin chain). They told me I would receive a prompt reply from the hotel -- a couple of days later I did indeed. The gist was "we are sorry to hear of your experience and we're sure that you might have a nicer room if you come back again". No thanks -- there are a lot of other nice hotels in downtown Seattle and we will try elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR122593360">An excellent downtown location close to Pike's Market, good restaurants and the Pacific and Westlake shopping malls.

They offered a package that was touted as including breakfast. The room amenities were listed as including the usual features: robes, toiletries, etc. We discovered at bed time that robes weren't in the closet. We called for them and discovered that one has to request them -- at no charge -- but hardly conducive to a relaxing evening when you're waiting 20 minutes for a bathrobe. The next morning, we discovered the same "lack" of a shower cap. I was told, again, it's free of charge, but one has to request it. The next morning we went to breakfast to discover that the complementary full breakfast was actually in a fast food cafe with counter service. Yes, we did receive the breakfast, but it was hardly the relaxed experience we anticipated in a full-service hotel dining room. On check out, we discovered an inexplicable charge on our bill (a room tax that represented about 40% of the bill). It was clear that the clerk didn't know how to calculate percentages, so she was befuddled. We spoke with the manager who couldn't answer the question about the 40% tax either, but he did reduce the cost of our room substantially to compensate us for the inconvenience. My guess: The Westin caters to tour groups. The cruise ships seem to use it as a staging location. So expect crowds of old-timers queuing up for their free breakfasts. The carpets look worn. The hotel looks a little old around the edges.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR122151194">Stayed here on 12/22 for one night with my family of 5 for some Christmas shopping. Hotel is in the best location for exploring Seattle, with quick access to shopping, monorail, all the sights. We were given a great room on the 43rd floor with an incredible southern view of the city. Staff was very friendly, and gave our young kids crayons and paper to color on during down time in the room. They were very flexible with late check-out the next day so we could extend our shopping and with pool hours as it is currently under renovation (but opened it early Friday morning so the kids could swim).

Of course since this is a premium downtown hotel in Seattle expect to pay to use the WiFi in your room and over $20 to park for a 24 hour period.

Initially, I tried to book the Fairmont Hotel, but they were overbooked, and so were most of the other hotels due to a conference that had booked over 90% of all of Seattle's rooms. The best deal I could find was with my travel agent in Australia. I ended up pre paying approx $300/night inc tax (Deluxe City View) for 6 nights at the Westin Seattle. After staying a couple of nights there, I actually started to really enjoy the hotel and its quirkiness ! I requested a room away from the elevators and high up, and upon check in I was given a room in the south tower on the 28th floor. I didn't like that room for the rate I had paid, which seemed more than many of their published rates, so I asked to change rooms immediately. I was then given room on the 42nd floor of the north tower that overlooked Lake Union and it was much better, although I was still surprised at the noise I heard from Seattle city, so far up. I guessed that the noise was similar to what you'd hear in New York, even though I haven't been there (yet). The earplugs I had packed helped a lot, as the elevators were loud, the ice machine was close by, and the hum of the city was constant. Fortunately I had quiet neighbours. As I was travelling solo, I requested a mini fridge and that came to my room promptly for no charge. I connected to the Wi Fi but gave up after the first day, it wasn't worth the money per day. (approx $9/day). There was a coffee machine and cardboard cups (but no kettle), an ironing board and iron, a mini safe, good blackout curtains and a Heavenly Bed that was soft and squishy but I got used to that. The TV was at a weird angle to watch from the bed, but I never used it anyway. I turned the air con off, it wasn't required, although it was fairly silent anyway. Even though the elevators were noisy, they did an excellent job! Housekeeping staff spoke minimal english, they were rarely around in the corridor at all, which was very quiet apart from the elevators and the ice machine. I never heard a vacuum cleaner, and being in the presence of a lone raw almond on the floor, near my coffee machine, from the start to the finish of my stay, it made me I wonder if they ever had used a vacuum cleaner! What I did really appreciate, apart from the view and location, was the hotel's phone express line. I found that if I wanted any advice or anything in the hotel eg concierge, housekeeping, rooms service etc, all I had to do was pick up the phone and dial 0. It was that simple, and I never had to wait for some one to answer and the operator was always polite and efficient. It really made my stay. That service, the view, and the location. Whilst in Seattle, from where I was at The Westin, I only had to walk minutes to main attractions and shops. The monorail to the Space Needle was closeby at the Westlake Centre, Nordstrom and Macy's were sort of diagonally opposite, the Pharmacy was directly opposite and the Pike Market, the highlight of Seattle, was an easy five minute walk away. Starbucks and Seattle's Best were nearby too. I caught the underground and above ground buses too, the concierge helped me with the stops and timetables. What I did find lacking was a good restaurant within the hotel. There is a very large lobby with lots of seating and a bar, and a coffee shop with food and a hotel gift shop, but I appreciate a good buffet breakfast and somewhere within a hotel to eat a main course at dinnertime when travelling solo. Unfortunately, there was no such setting within the hotel to provide this opportunity. Having said that, I noted that Daliah's Lounge was close by with an excellent Dahlia's take away shop next door, and I loved Farestart Restaurant, 700 Virginia St, nearby too. The Pike Market was always a reliable place for coffee, snacks and meals. In summary, I would definitely return to this hotel for its location, views and service. If possible, request for a high floor, away from the elevators, in the north tower overlooking the Space Needle. If its affordable, a Grand View Room would ensure 38 floors or above. Other than that, I would be wanting to get value for money on a lower floor by not having to pay too much.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR121401056">This was my first trip to Seattle.

Food was fine but it wasnt great to have to queue to order food and pay at a till.

The views were great... can't fault them there... but beyond that... it is a very disjointed hotel, parking and checkin is a mess unless you are aware that you are to go to parking prior to checking in. The rooms are ok, we had a suite, but very dated, bathrooms are something out of a Holiday express and yet older and in worse shape. The breakfast was at a nook in the corner of the lobby... now this was very much like a Holiday Express... can't imagine why they do not have a dining room to eat at.. Coffee maker in room was fine, yet no mugs as is typical in upscale hotels,,, they provide paper cups, I wonder if the Gen. manager has training at Express type hotels... as with all the perceived ambiance... at it's core beat the heart of a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn express. If you were to buy a bottle of water while walking around Seattle... and thought you might utilize the in room refrigerator to keep it cold... a blunt sign on the refrigerator states that a $7.00 charged will be levied if it is used for storage of items.. Not a very quite hotel either... on the 41st floor certainly no street noises , yet the walls must be paper thin, as we could all above and around us. The cold air coming in from the window was just another reminder of the state of this hotel.

Iâ€™m not sure if it is Alaskan Highway or the absolutely delicious Dungeness crab, or simply, the Seattle street vibe. There is something about Seattle that makes you fall in love with the city from the first day on. We stayed at the Westin Seattle hotel downtown which is a twin tower high-rise hotel, 47-storey high. The hotel is very comfortable and the view from our room was absolutely breath taking. The hotel is just steps away from the Washington State Convention Center, Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. You can find great food in the lobby at the Coldwater Bar and Grill and free internet access (in the lobby of the hotel only). We arrived by air at the SeaTac Airport (featured in Greyâ€™s Anatomy!) and took the Link Light Rail system that extends south from the city core to SeaTac Airport.

Positives first - location is great- easy walk to everywhere, nicely decorated rooms, wonderful service especially the concierge(++), clean safe rooms and very fast elevators. Down side - poor sound proofing to hall - can hear people talking and the "ding" of the elevator, maybe the heavenly bed does not suit us as none of us slept particularly well because the beds were quite soft (also as there were 3 of us we needed 2 beds and they do not have 2 queens only doubles or 1 king and a cot), long &amp; slow line to check in at front desk and competent but not friendly staff, add on extra costs for everything including internet.

For this reason alone I would probably book this hotel again. Although it may not always be an option. Parking - is something around 40 dollars, which seems kind of crazy. They have open lots across the street, but we didn't want to lug our stuff across the road. I think those lots will run you around 10 bucks for 24 hours on the weekends. There is a lot which connects to the Westins second floor and you can park 24 hours for 25 Bucks (it was 18 the last time i stayed here, but it's gone up). Wifi - 10 bucks per connection! Passed on it Minibar - prices are crazy (as usual for a hotel mini-bar). 7.50 for a liter of water. I also read in other reviews that if you move the stuff around and use it for your own stuff, you get charged 7 or 8 bucks Room - Kinda old. Carpet had lots of stains. This one i couldn't believe, at a hotel with rates about 200 a night. They had flatscreen TVs with no Hi Def! Yikes, even my Best Western the night before had hi-def. Bed and pillows were pretty nice. Good blackout curtains as well. Bathroom - Toilet was not mounted right and felt like it was going to fall over. No Fan in the bathroom? Weird. Pool/ Hot Tub - Monday morning there was no one there, so it was outstanding. It has a glass roof so you can see a lot outside. Very nice. Free lockers (about the only thing they don't charge for at this hotel) I got a deal on this place with priceline, so for the price i paid, I was satisfied. If I paid the standard rate, i'd probably be a little pissed off. All in all, if I ended up with this place when bidding on priceline again, I would just find cheaper parking.

Both my wife and I felt for the price we paid per night that things could have been better. For example the room was a bit tired (old carpet, bathroom tiles in need of replacing). A rollaway bed had been requested before arrival (we were getting in later in the evening with a 3 year old child and a time zone difference which meant that he had had a longer day) As usual it was not in the room and had to be brought up. To her credit that lady at reception sympathised with the situation and made it a priority. Check in was slow. Only two receptionists on duty at a time of evening when lots of people were checking in. However my biggest gripe and one that was not resolved due to tiredness and timing was breakfast. When I booked the room (a couple of weeks before travel) I asked for a breakfast rate...which I was given. When my email confirmation came through it confirmed number of visitors as 3 but gave breakfast for 2. Now my son is only 3 years old and other hotel brands do give free breakfast for children under 5...but to be sure of this fact I emailed the hotel before our visit....heard nothing back. Figured that it was no issue....my son would be included...arrived at checkin...handed breakfast vouchers for me and my wife...and when I asked about my son was met with a blank look before having it confirmed that he wasn't included at breakfast. Maybe it is a business hotel....but I don't really think it is acceptable to confirm a reservation for 3 and then give breakfast for 2. Not really what you want to have to sort out after a long travel day....which we didn't...we spoke to a receptionist in the morning who gave us vouchers for my son. At the time I was pleased and felt the problem had been rectified until I got my final bill and saw a charge from the breakfast cafe which I presumed was said voucher. GIven that we had a deadline to meet for onward travel I did not argue this on checkout as the reception area was busy..but I was not pleased and felt this was disrespectful. Especially as a 3 year old child is not eating the same quantity as an adult and I am pretty sure what I got charged was for an adult breakfast If you book as a family you should be treated as a family. I don't want extra charges on my bill at the end of a stay for things that should have been taken care of before I even arrived and would save the stress levels and the feeling that children are a nuisance.

The fees are pretty high given how dated the rooms &amp; overall decor were. Beware, parking is pricey - $30+/day. Overall: Low marks for value. Rooms are a bit noisy from what seems like thinner than avg walls. Also, if its windy, prepare yourself b/c the building sways! I was told this is 'normal', but still left me with a very uneasy feeling for 2 nights - and I was only on the 16th floor (out of 48!)

I would still recommend that you stay here at least once, and probably twice. On my next visit I plan on asking them to reserve a room for the first two nights on one side of the tower and for the next few nights on a different side or different towerâ€¦ This is because the cylindrical towers offer large semicircular windows offering expansive views of the city. Itâ€™s tough to provide a more detailed review, because of the combination of standard Westin features, like dual showerheads, heavenly beds, and brilliant location of outlets with lamps for laptop and other charging needs, with issues like slightly worn towels, a goofy bathroom door that nearly forces you to close it to maneuver, and lots of crevices that confound the cleaning ladies (I dropped a tissue and knelt to pick it up, and realized that there were large crumbs under/beside the bed hidden by the overlapping comforter and frame). Still, you should stay here at least once. Forty-six floors up you can see the city and waterfront and take spectacular photos. The location offers a great base for excursions to Pike Place Market and several good restaurants. Also, itâ€™s a little closer to the Space Needle than some other top-tier lodging options.

Best of all was the location. The monorail to the Space Needle was right outside the door. Downhill stroll of 10 minutes to Pike's Market. Bus stops everywhere. The concierges were fantastic and seemed to remember where we had been and asked how it went. For a quick breakfast, McDonalds out the back door as was a great food court which had fantastic Thai food. It was a wonderful experience and I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119376893">Despite the negative reviews some others have said about The Westin Seattle, we had an absolutely fabulous time. We were placed on the 35th floor and had a view of both waterways of Seattle. We felt like we were living on top of the world! The king beds are incredibly soft and they had a two-headed shower system for total relaxation. The lobby was chic with a lot of businesspeople lounging and it's within steps of a wonderful pizza joint-- Serious Pie-- and of course, as many Starbucks coffee shops that you need. Perfect location, beautiful hotel, great rooms-- what more could you want? I would definitely ask for a room on an upper floor-- totally worth it!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119356617">We had a very enjoyable 6 night stay at The Westin in October 2011. The hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance of all the downtown attractions in Seattle. Thereâ€™s a large drugstore right across the street, a rental car location opposite and the Monorail for the Space Needle departs from the nearby Westlake Center. The 5th Avenue Corner CafÃ© situated in the hotel is a convenient place to grab breakfast with a good range of options at a reasonable price. We had an outstanding view from our Grand View room which was clean and tidy. The dÃ©cor in the room as well as the rest of the hotel could do with updating but it didnâ€™t detract from our stay. The beds were comfortable, thereâ€™s an in-room safe but unfortunately you have to pay to use the fridge. There are 3 computers which you can make use of in the lobby but at a charge of $7.95 for 15 minutes! On our previous visit we stayed at the Grand Hyatt but The Westin is a superior option.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119351859">We were sooo looking forward to this vacation that when we opened the room door we were stunned by the floor-to-wall window view of the space needle. But that was the high-point... As other reviewers have pointed out, the carpet was simply dirty and needs replacing ASAP. Next, the bathroom was stinky. It smelt like mold. Maybe the shower curtain needed to be replaced as well. Wi-Fi was chargeable - really in this day and age it should have been free. Pikes place is a good walk from the hotel and the monorail to the space needle is close by. Westin seems to nickel-and-dime you on all little amenities that you get for free at other places. We would definitely look elsewhere for our next trip to the great northwest.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119301119">Only stayed for one night and did not require any services but our room was clean and nice looking. The hotel is walking distance to Pike's Place Market, waterfront and the bus station which was great as that was out mode of transportation to our next stop. I was stunned that there was a daily charge for wifi in the room -- you've got to be kidding! Wifi was available for free in public areas, which I used but that was really inconvenient.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119242853">Biggest problem: my room smells. In fact, the room, the fridge, the hallway outside the room, and the elevator all smell bad and each in different ways. There was also a wet spot on my carpet, a stain on my duvet, and the bathroom light switches are grotty. I know different people have different standards, so for reference, in the past twelve months I've had 30 different hotel stays around the country, and this is the first hotel that seemed gross to me. This would be unacceptable at any price, and at this price it's an outrage. I tried to move, but everything is booked up for a conference.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119184327">Had a short in-and-out stay in Seattle, and just happened to book a night at Westin. A huge place but it doesn't feel overcrowded. The room was neat, nice panoramic window. Check-in and check-out were okay, but it felt like they would be better off having a couple of extra staff on duty. The location is as central as it gets, everything you can see in Seatlle (which is not a lot, frankly), is within a leisurely walk reach. Beware of quite a hefly parking charge - it costs $41 per day. WiFi is free in the lobby area and approx. $10 per day in the room - which is okay. All in all, a positive experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119038616">We booked 2 rooms for two nights and were told we would have to move from one room after the first night to get ajoining rooms. Had written confirmation. When we arrived 1 room was booked for 7 days?? and one booking was not there?? They fixed this. After checking in, we went to dinner. Came back to find one room had been canceled and our keys did not work. They fixed this. In the morning went to move rooms and found they had again canceled one room, the wrong one, and our reserveation for the new was gone. They fixed this. Then we were overcharged. Spent over 4 hours of a two day stay dealing with their registration problems. Rooms were nice....when we could get in them.

We will definately stay at The Westin again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118832974">I stayed at this hotel for two reasons: discounted corporate price &amp; central downtown location. It's location is central, close to public transportation. However, this hotel comes with nothing. I have a great view from my room, nice beds, great dual shower head. However the hotel stocks the fridge with a 400% markup on items. If you use the fridge for your personal use, you have to pay a $7 fee. There are no vending machines or soda machines. There is a drug store within a block but it doesn't keep city hours. The room also ran quite warm. We were burning hot each night (might be the posh beds). Beware that the parking is $40 for a 24 hr period. This is about the most expensive for the city. It's not pro-rated either. The parking is run by a private contracted company to the hotel. Really just okay considering what you pay. Not being able to use the own fridge in your room was just pitiful. The hotel also charges for internet and printing. I did enjoy the views for the higher floors. I was disappointed that the curtain facades were not dusted. Totally coated in dust that the AC blows directly on.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118677186">This was our second trip to a Westin property, and we our expectations were more than met. The best thing about this particular property was the view of the Seattle skyline. We were able to get upgraded to a corner room on one of the upper floors. At night, we were able to set up a tripod and take breath-taking photos of the Seattle skyline. The rest of the room was pretty standard, with a white, clean decor. Nothing spectacular there, but the location and the view made up for it. Would definitely recommend this property in its prefect location in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118652461">We stayed at the Westin Seattle for 6 nights in September 2011. It's a very nice hotel with excellent views. Obviously this is not a cheap hotel. But I was offended to see that they charged $1.50 plus $0.14 tax on every phone call I made. And I only made local calls. The minibar prices were the highest I've ever seen. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was comfortable. I probably won't stay there again because of all the extra charges. (Like $7 charged if you use the fridge for your own items.)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118565457">We stayed at the Westin Seattle for 3 nights in late early September 2011. Room on 39th floor of North Tower faced West (towards water and Space Needle) which made for amazing sunset views. Very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. We had requested a quiet room and were given a room at the very end of the hall. This location turned out to be not quiet because the doors are thin and/or noise travels very well (when we returned and quietly opened our own door one night, our next door neighbor thought we were opening his door). So we ended up listening to housekeeping using the utility closet every morning. Somehow it was quite loud in what was a not very populated hallway--if you want a quiet room, ask to be away from both the elevators and housekeeping. When we arrived around 6 pm, I asked the front desk to send sheets/blanket up for the sofabed right away and they said they would do so. An hour later, we had to leave for a dinner engagement, but there were no sheets. When we spoke with the concierge about this on the way out, we told her that we had waited an hour and housekeeping had not appeared; strangely she did not ask for our room number nor took any action, but simply assured me they was coming. Four hours later when we returned, there were still no sheets. In essence, the hotel was sold out for a conference and while the staff were always polite, they were not particularly friendly nor did they step up to make our stay feel more than a standard experience. The location was great, but I got the impression the guests were basically on their own. Some tips: If you go to Pikes Place Market, keep in mind that the vendors close up around 4-5 pm --and start early. You can buy huge beautiful bouquets of fresh flowers for very reasonable prices (nice romantic touch). Great take-out sushi can be had at the food-court at nearby Westlake Mall. The Westin charges $41 for self-parking, but there is a lot right next door that charges $22 and it has a skyway that links into the Westin. We had a 12 year old who really enjoyed the Boeing Museum of Flight, the ferry cruises, the EMP, and of course, the Space Needle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118549537">This is our 2nd trip to the Westin Seattle. I guess I feel it is getting a bit tired as the sheets are a bit pilly, the towels are slightly threadbare ~ you know...just showing a bit of age. However, the staff here is excellent and we have great service and love to come on our annual trip away from the kids. I suggest a room above floor 20 to get away from the potential noise from the monorail. Housekeeping has been lacking in the recent hotels I have stayed in but here - they got it right! So impressed with the housekeeping. The TV is crummy and unless we were doing something wrong, all the channels are in analog, therefore it looks terrible. The 5th Ave., Cafe in the lobby is actually really good and handy if you are needing something quick and tasty before heading out for the day - they have it all from oatmeal to omelets to eggs and cereal. Again, staff there is super friendly. The lounge was good for a couple drinks - DO try the Dungeness Crab Mac n' Cheese - REAL CRAB.... and tasty....skip the calamari - ick. This location is right around the corner from EVERYTHING downtown. We never bring a car and we hit all the major Seattle hotspots. There is an AMC movie theatre at the mall around the corner that sells $3 Microbrew beer! There is a pizza joint a couple blocks away (Serious Pie) that will make you re-think your traditional pizza and come begging for more. The shops are all close, live theatre and Top Pot Donuts for warm fresh donuts! All in all, this is a good place and we will certainly come back ... it is like staying at your aunt's place in the spare room ... nice and clean, friendly but nothing outstanding or new. A little dated but comfortable and predictable.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118528019">This is how a hotel is suppose to operate. Best service and ambiance of a large hotel since the Palmer House in Chicago, which is tops. Located three blocks from Pike Place Market, this conference hotel does it right. Though it has nearly 900 rooms, it operates like a much smaller hotel because it has numerous elevators, helpful personnel, and creates an atmosphere that says "we're glad you are here." We were at an international maritime conference and stayed five nights, six days. From the moment they greeted us at the curb to put our luggage in storage until our room was ready to checkout, the staff was primed and ready. And actually smiled, a trait some hotels need to teach their personnel. I'd stay here on my own dime, not just business. Only knock is the $7.95 charge for 15 minutes of computer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118433753">Room okay, certainly a nice location, but the little things got to me. $9.95 internet charge. $7.00 dollar service charge if you put any personal item in the minibar fridge. $4.00 for a .99 cent tube of toothpaste in the gift shop. No TV listing in the room and the TV is analog and impossible to know what channel is what, and the main desk had no answers. I applaud that if you "go green" and forego housekeeping, they give you a $5.00 "food and beverage" credit, but really, a $5.00 food and beverage credit, that with the inflated prices really cost Westin maybe $2.50? How much does Westin save if you forego housekeeping, laundry, replacement of coffee and bath items? Thus, Westin even makes a profit if you "go green," undercutting that they even care. If the sheep keep giving this 5 stars, nothing will change.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR118390659">The Westin is located in easily the best location for tourists visiting Seattle. My husband and I did not rent a car and found it very easy to navigate around the city without one (of note, parking is a premium as it is in any major city and if you rent a car from the airport, you are loaded with a ton of airport taxes). From SeaTac airport, the best (and most affordable) way to get to the hotel is to take the Light Rail all the way to the end (one way is a meager $2.75 per person and takes about 30 minutes). The Light Rail is located at the end of the airport Parking Garage. Follow the signs, which are clearly marked. At the end of the Light Rail stop, it's about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and clean and the room we had was very spacious. It was well thought out for business travelers (a nice desk overlooking the window to comfortably accommodate laptops and files) as well as leisurely travelers (a large couch to place all the souvenirs without tripping all over them). The bed was super comfortable and the a/c worked just fine. There aren't too many rooms per floor for such a large hotel (there's 12 rooms per floor), making the stay feel a little more personable for its size. Despite being on the 41st (out of 48) floors, the elevators were very quick and efficient. My only small complaint is that I wish the bathroom amenities came with a shower gel rather than a bar of soap. We did not take eat at the cafe near the north tower elevators nor the restaurant, so I cannot comment on that. However, there are a ton of excellent restaurants within walking distance. The two we tried and highly recommend were Dahlia Lounge and Spur Gastropub. Here's a breakdown of what is nearby: The famous Pike Place Market is about a 5 minutes walk away and Pioneer Square is about 15 minutes walk away. Fashionistas would love the largest Nordstrom store I've ever seen (I believe it's the flagship location) and surrounding shops/mall just a few streets over. Taxi ride to Capitol Hill cost about $8.00 and about $10.00 to Canlis restaurant (a must go restaurant for foodies). Overall I was very pleased with our 3 night stay. The only reason why I did not rate this 5 stars was because we encountered with disappointing service during our second night. We had extremely noisy guests next door who started to argue at 3:30AM. They were using a lot of profanity and we did not feel it was in our position to knock on their door. In addition to their arguing, they also brought a dog that was barking. The noise was loud enough to where you could hear it from the hallway. We called front desk twice to have them contact the guests, but nothing was done. The guests continue to argue without anyone from the hotel contacting them. Unfortunately, we had to wake up early to attend an all-day seminar, so that was not a very pleasant day for us. I want to be clear that I am not giving a lower mark because of the noisy guests. I know that the hotel cannot control the type of people staying in every room. However, I was highly disappointed that nobody from security or front desk failed to respond to our repeated requests to contact the noisy guests that they were disrupting us. I felt we did the right thing to notify the hotel of the issue and that they should have addressed our request more promptly...or at least offer us an explanation as to why nothing was done if they were unable to do something about it. Fortunately, the guests checked out the next night, so our final night was quiet and allowed us to catch up on some much needed sleep. Despite that, I admit that the rest of our stay was perfect. I would stay there again. I would just bring ear plugs and keep in mind that not all guests are considerate to others nearby.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118332673">If you get invited to a gal here, consider just writing the organization a check and going out for Chinese.

The windows and the amazing mattress had only the luxurious bathroom to compete with for our attention while at the Seattle Westin.

We were using SPG points which at Marriott means pretty royal treatment. No so here. The front desk staff person did give us free wi-fi since we were staying for only one night which was very helpful, but its hard for me to understand why they charge for it in your room but its free in the lobby....go figure. Our room was not ready when we arrived and although they gave us a key to use the business center (our laptop was in our luggage which had been checked by the bellman since our room wasn't ready)....the internet access in the business center was also not free. This is just plain tacky...especially for their loyal SPG members. At Marriott....if you are gold status you get complimentary breakfast....not so here. When I check with the SPG desk I was told that although they know that Marriott does do that, Weston does not. When we got to our room, which was very nice, clean, beautiful view and very satisfactory the bellman brought our luggage up but when I asked for an extra luggage rack, he told me that was not available and we would have to use the coffee table or the safe in the closet to put our second bag on. When we looked for the mini fridge to chill our water, there was a note that said if you used the mini fridge for your own stuff you would be charged $6.00 per day...unbelievable and finally there was a note saying if you would give up having your room cleaned they would give you a small credit...don't remember how much, but I just thought "This is a first class hotel" The bed was comfortable and the staff at the front desk were very friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118180419">After staying @ a lovely Westin in Portland, I was looking forward to a similar experience in Seattle. Sadly that was not to be- from check-in to check-out and everything in between the experience paled in comparison. My hotel room was musty and smelly, someone previously must have smoked in the room and it hadn't been aired out. To be fair, there was a huge convention in town, but that doesn't mean that I should experience any less level of customer service! Asked for some take-out menus from the front desk- assured that they would be sent up, had to call twice and then finally go down to get them myself. Someone did eventually bring them up while I was going down to the front desk- talk about wires crossed. The room it self was truly the main disappointment- it was shabby without the chic. Everything seemed tired or old- don't even get me started on how filthy the carpeting was or how dingy the couch.

It is perfectly located within walking distance of most attractions? If not, the public transportation is just across the street. There is a huge shopping mall right across the street.

They were still pretty but the cracks were evident. In this case the rooms were old and moldy, mini bar had planters peanuts, wine was something cheap. Little details like buttons on elevators were used up and didn't light up. The clock radio was an old GE thing from 1985. Seriously?? No i-pod clock radio to charge your phone or MP3 player???

The thing that irritates me most though is the "go green" get 5 bucks for not having the maid clean your room deal. How blatantly transparent can these corporate idiots be? They must think we customers are morons. First, anyone staying at the Seattle Westin has to have enough money that five bucks isnâ€™t going to put him/her in a pinch. Second, maids need to work too. Third, how is not having a hotel pay someone to cleanup your room a â€œgreenâ€� issue? Itâ€™s just plain old corporate greed people.

The structure of the conference center suggests that the hotel is designed to host large conferences. What this means for the holiday traveler hard to say. The room didn't disappoint in any way. Everything was well designed and of consistent quality of construction. The only exception was the tub and the shower curtain. The tub was a basic plastic tub found in any hotel and so was the curtain.

In the morning we had coffee downstairs. I do not recommend the starbucks at all. It was so bitter I returned it for a tea. My son drank his coffee and ended up with a stomach from the acid in the coffee. When we returned from the cruise I realize that I forgot my cell phone charger and some underwear in the room. They could'nt find the underwear but they said they would ship the charger. They did not give me a price when I asked. I looked at my credit card statement and realized I was charged $80.00 to ship the small charger that weighed about 6 oz to a city across the border that was 20 mins away by plane. This is overpriced for sure. I contacted the Westin by phone and Email. I never got a call back but I did get a email 4 days later stating they were passing it on to someone else. Very poor after service. I would stay here again if the price was cheaper. The lobby was dull and not very pretty. The room itself was comfy.

We took the Light Rail from the airport to downtown and the walk from the downtown station to the hotel was very manageable. We were pleased to be able to utilize public transport and to save the money on a rental car/parking. The room itself was nice, although a little outdated. The bathroom also seemed pretty small for a Westin. I did enjoy that the building was curved and that the room was set up with the bed at an angle to look out the window. We were on the 8th floor with a room overlooking the Monorail station so the view was less than desirable. I know now to definitely request a high floor. There was a lot of street noise during the day, but luckily it quieted down at night to a level that didn't disturb my sleep. We were able to pay for our stay with some SPG reward points plus a little cash. So for the price we paid for the hotel we didn't feel we could complain about the floor we were assigned.

Front desk services was great - early check in was a breeze, and late check out was good, too. Hotel was clean and nice, but it seemed a bit dated to me - decor was a little older, and elevators seemed to take a long time. Amenities were also nice - great to have the option to work out, and a dip in the pool/hot tub was nice... Not impressed with having to pay for wifi, though! One thing that I was pretty annoyed with was that even though we had requested late check out we had a service employee actually enter our room at 8 am (while we were in bed, sleeping) and another try to enter again at 12! But the thing that redeemed this hotel was the LOCATION. It was super close to shopping, not far away from Pike Pace and close enough to have a great view/walk to the Space Needle.

We had requested 2 adjoining so we can be in the same "room" with our children. The hotel had to switch us to a different floor for the 2 adjoining rooms so we had to sit in the lobby waiting for the rooms to be serviced. Good thing they provided free internet service in the hotel lobby so our kids were entertained during the 1/2 hr wait. We used our GPS to guide us to the hotel but due to the two entrances, it was listed as North and South but the same street numbers. We ended up at the front entrance with loading zone parking so my husband went in and encountered a grumpy not very helpful concierge who was quite curt giving my husband direction to the valet on the back side of the hotel. Valet paring with tax costs $43 a night and the parking attendants were all very helpful. The rooms were decent size with floor to ceiling windows, both with 2 beds. One of the rooms is geared for wheelchairs, power curtains, bathroom bars and larger space between the toilet and shower. Strangest thing is the adjoining doors, if they're opened then you cannot open the entry way doors. Housekeeping. The bathrooms were being kept clean enough but I noticed dust accumulating on the lamp base and bedside table only after just a couple of nights there. The hair dryer in my room also did not work properly, only on high and not low. The handle was caked with dried hair product. One of the worst I've seen in hotels and this was in a Westin! I didn't complain because I could easily walk over to the kids' room to use their blowdryer. There's also a complimentary coffee and tea tray and I thought it was a nice touch to have "fresh" cream and not powder packages in the room. However, we encountered 4 sour creamers the morning we tried to make coffee. Normally they need to be refrigerated so I was surprised to see them just sitting out so who knows how long they've been in room temp environment. The hotel charges $9 per unit per day for internet which I find outrageous! If Holiday Inn, Hamptons and Delta can provide free internet then the Westin should be able to as well. We spent an awful lot of times in the lobby, just like everyone else loitering in the lobby and lounge. My husband encountered the grumpy concierge whom we never saw again, but we also received excellent service from Ted helping us secure a couple of last minute restaurant reservations. He was so smooth! The security guard by the check in desk can smile a bit and be friendlier though. The 5th Ave Cafe next to the elevators serves very good breakfast which includes steel cut oatmeal for $5. It's convenience but I'd walk one block to have breakfast at Lola's. The hotel is well located, one block from Nordstrom, shoes shoes &amp; shoes! and walking distance to Pike Place Market. .<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117670096">I stayed here during a large conference because it was one of the options for our conference rate. However, it turned out that the bulk of other hotel guests were cruise ship passengers with Royal Caribbean, which made for a loud atmosphere. Check-in was professional and fine, but when we got to our room, it smelled like old, sweaty socks or a boys' locker room. It was disgusting; clearly the effect of a problem with the ventilation system. We knew the hotel was sold out and didn't ask for another room as they wouldn't have been able to correct the problem. The smell never went away for all four nights of our stay. The rooms are dingy and old, with extremely dirty carpet. A major pet peeve of mine is the absence of power outlets on the nightstand; the Westin Seattle does not have these, making it difficult to both charge a phone overnight and use it as an alarm clock simultaneously. The hotel is convenient to downtown shopping and has great views, but is a bit of a hike to the Washington State Convention Center, where our conference met. I didn't mind the walk, but as it is mostly uphill, it would be a challenge for those with mobility issues. The 5th Avenue Cafe downstairs is great and a good value for hotel breakfasts - I had an omelet and hashbrowns for about $10 one morning and a bagel for about $3 on another day. The walls and doors are, as others have noted, paper thin and you can forget about sleeping in once the housekeeping staff start vacuuming. The Heavenly Beds were great as always, but we couldn't sleep much due to all the noise on our floor - you can hear ordinary conversations spoken at a normal volume level quite clearly through the walls. One final issue: the elevators do not have key card access, and we witnessed at least one homeless individual using the ice machine on our floor (35) to procure ice for her needs. I appreciate the charitable spirit of allowing others to use the Westin's ice, but it definitely made us feel insecure to see someone who was obviously not a hotel guest on our floor - it was clear that anyone could wander in at any time. Perhaps the Westin could reach out to the area's homeless community in other ways while better securing access to the guest floors.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117666325">Great view from the upper floors.

We get to our room, which turned out to be NEXT to the Royal Suite. We walked in and we had a king bed and a city view! Went back downstairs to talk the check-in and was told they had NO rooms with that view I was promised available, due to being full capacity! They then got the Hotel Manager and after 2 hours of dealing with this they mysteriously found me a regular room with a view of The Space Needle!

It needs to be totally refurbished. It's staff also needs to pay attention to its upkeep and cleanliness. We had room service one night. The dishes stayed in our room. we placed them in the hallway next to the door. They sat in the hallway for 2 days. (they may still be there). The lobby bathroom was disgustingly dirty on two occasions. It seems the staff is just not paying attention to things that Westin used to be known for. And upon arrival they would not honor our AAA rate because they said that we did not book it with that rate (we did). The desk person said that the room had to be booked with that rate or we would forfeit our reservation and would not have any room because they were "full." We paid the rack rate. The hotel made about $100 off of us, but lost our goodwill and future business (hope it was worth it for Westin). The positives: it is a great downtown location. Close to everything. Parking at the Westin self park is reasonable ($22/ with in out privileges). The concierge was awesome -- but very busy. Lobby area and bar with free wi-fi (helpful IT staff) albeit a bit noisy. I think that they sell out to the cruise ships and that is impacting the quality. Fitness room was tiny and outdated. breakfast at the cafe was very good but noisy, very crowded and expensive.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117234745">This was the first time I stayed with the family at the Westin. This hotel chain is known for their "Heavenly" beds and great service. I had experienced it as a business traveler, and was very happy with it. My wife and I are very picky about the beds. The beds at the Westin were really good the first two to three nights. They are very comfortable and they "hug" you... and that is the problem after the third night... You really don't move from one or two positions through the nigth, so it ends up hurting the shoulders or the lower back. Anyway.... The service was impecable. Every time we had a request, they delivered within fifteen minutes to an hour, depending on the complexity of the request. We have a two year-old and we asked for a crib, which also had a very comfortable mattress, so we did not hear from him.... And while not well known, they have kids kits for them to do activities, books, etc. They also have a pool that the kids loved, and more importantly, the security is very good. Some teenagers, already intoxicated, came to the pool with more booze, and security quickly removed them. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience, and since it was close to the monorail, we went to the space needle many times!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR117224856">a great downtown location.

I've always had great experiences with Westins, so had no doubt that I'd enjoy my stay here. The location is superb, right in the middle of downtown Seattle, and a 15 minute walk to the market. Service was excellent - front desk staff were courteous and friendly. The 3-star rating comes from the hotel appearance and upkeep. The floor on which my room was located was dull and dingy. The room was large, but the furnishing were tired, and although I had a view of the space needle, I was distracted with how dreary the room was. Of course, the bed was comfortable as they always are at Westins. I think that if a hotel calls itself a Westin, you should at least get the same quality of furnishings and ambience. It's a brand - like McDonalds, you expect that consistency no matter where you are.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR117006075">Right in the heart of Seattle downtown area.

It was a little pricier than we wanted, but we thought we'd pay extra for the convenience. The location was great. 15-minute walk to the Space Needle or Pike Place Market. There was shopping all around, too. Checking in was easy, and we got two cribs for our kids easily. The bed was SUPER comfortable and the room was clean and had a stunning view. The concierge was very helpful and friendly. The room was not remarkably large and seemed less so with 2 small cribs in it and the carpet seemed well-worn. My one big problem was the feeling of being nickel-and-dimed. Internet is not free in the rooms, and if I had wanted to put my babies' bottles in the mini-fridge, it would have been $7! I also needed to make 2 toll-free phone calls, and they charged me $2 for each call! As a result of these charges, the lobby is full of internet users who don't want to pay, and I kept my babies' milk in the ice bucket. I would probably try elsewhere if I return to Seattle in the future. It was just too high for what we received.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116945060">I stayed here for business, it is located just off the I5 and is 10min walk from pike place market. They have soo much shopping all around. If you go to seattle make sure you do the market stroll and go to the original starbucks down there all very cool to see. The Westin is very nice, the rooms were a bit smaller then I expected but I guess when downtown they try to use as much space as possible. The rooms were clean and I would stay again strictly for location. We also were on the 20somtheing floor so very nice view. I am not sure how much it cost as it was a business trip so I can't judge whether I would pay what they charge to stay there again but overall a decent hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR116587249">The location is great for shopping and you can walk to pretty much any major tourist attraction in the central area of Seattle. We chose to take taxis twice when we were too tired to walk 20-25 minutes at the end of the day. Most places are under a 20 minute walk. However, I was disappointed with this Westin. This is normally one of our favorite chain hotels. The carpet in our room was quite dirty and bore multiple large stains throughout the room. Yuk! The bed was the awesome beds Westin is well known for. The room was otherwise clean, but the bathroom was not what I would call large. It was adequate for two people as long as one was in the shower while the other got ready. A quick peek into another room while being cleaned showed that it too had an old, dirty carpet. I've never had to use slippers in a Westin hotel room before, but this time I did. Also, even though we were on one of the higher floors (even though we'd requested a low floor) we could hear sirens, honking and the traffic below. I wear earplugs so no bother for me at night, but my family could hear it. Lastly, the two times we asked the valets or doormen for directions or information it was incorrect.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116579154">Stayed here for one night, check-in was quick, front desk was friendly &amp; helpful.

The hotel is centrally located, and has very good views from the higher floors of the towers. It also has decent rates for a Westin. However, I've had much better stays at other Westins. I was upgraded to a room with a better view, but when I walked in, neither the hallway light or the table lamp were working. An engineer came after 20 minutes and fixed them. The rooms overall have seen better days. There also weren't any breakfast menus in the room, and I had to call again for those to be sent up. When I asked about the business center hours, I was told by the reception clerk that they open at 8 AM. But when I showed up at the center, I learnt that they actually open at 7. Had I known that, I would have come earlier and saved some last minute rushing. Seems like something as simple as the business center hours should be common knowledge to the front desk staff. Staff service and friendliness overall was very good, but I wasn't that impressed with the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR116486506">Spent a night here prior to shifting to a different conference hotel in town. The hotel is clean and comfortable, and has a very nice location near various attractions. Also, the floor to ceiling windows are neat, as are the wedge-shaped rooms since the towers are circular. There were a few *minor* annoyances, such as the following: 1) due to a delayed train, we checked in at almost 1am with our 6 year old. There was a line 4 deep at check in, and one of the two agents on duty just chatted with guests for a long time while the rest of us waited to get checked in and to our rooms; 2) the pool and spa area was completely closed the day we were there, and there was no announcement of that fact nor any apology for it until I escalated the situation to a manager; 3) as a SPG gold member, supposedly I can get an upgraded room and a late check out, but in this case I was told I had to choose one or the other (so I chose the late check out).

Otherwise, we probably would not stay at the Westin while in Seattle. Very long line at checkin (18 people in line); but we moved to the SPG preferred check in (hidden in the room to the right) and check in was much, much faster. This is an older hotel, and it shows. The rooms are OK but you can tell they are well worn. Standard Westin beds, and bathroom goodies. The location is good (unless you are heading towards one of the stadiums ... then the W or Sheraton are closer). I prefer the North tower as you have a better chance of water view. Parking is expensive; we park up the street about four blocks in a paid lot and walk (Was $6 for the evening until 7am. We moved the car in the AM to free street parking-Sunday. Total $6 for parking). I would say I do prefer the W and Sheraton over the Westin but we stayed here only because of the lower rate.

We were upgraded to one of the rooms on the higher floors, so we had an absolutely amazing view of the city and the water. The room itself was a bit tight (but it may just have been the specific room that we had). One great thing about the hotel were the roll-out beds. I've seen a lot of roll out beds in hotels that have a one inch thick mattress, the Westin was an exception to this. The mattress on the roll-out bed was just as thick as the mattress on the actual bed and it was extremely comfortable! The rooms were quiet (never heard our neighbours) and it was a perfect location for exploring the city by foot and also for catching a cab. The only negative thing I can say about this hotel was in regards to the valet parking. Aside from the fees being quite high, and the "you park" lot appearing inaccessible, when we would drop off the car for valet we would often wait for up to ten minutes (even if there was only one car in front of us). Twice we had to get out of the car to get someone's attention to take the car and give us a ticket for the valet.

We arrived on the Saturday of Memorial Weekend and paid $119 + tax booked indirect with a UK provider. This was $60+ tax cheaper than the best rate available direct from the Westin website. Whilst appreciating the great price for a Downtown property in Seattle we were rather concerned by the negative reviews that seemed to be consistently posted by Tripadvisor users, but as it turned out a number of these were one review contributors and I did start to believe that there was some kind of vendetta against the Westin. Whether this is true or not, I donâ€™t know, but it did leave us feeling rather uneasy before travelling to Seattle. We didnâ€™t need to worry at all. We arrived from the airport using the Light Rail, which takes about 35mins to the Westlake Center and is $2.50 per person. It is a 2 minute walk from here to the Westin entrance. First impressions were excellent. The hotel does have a lovely lobby area which is huge, with a number of seating areas along with a bar, and a breakfast/lunch cafÃ© at one end. The reception desk was well staffed and we were able to check in immediately. We were greeted by a lovely young lady who seemed as happy to see us as we were to see her and she kindly provided us with a King Bed Space Needle view on the 20th floor of the North Tower. Our first experience with the â€˜notoriousâ€™ Westin elevators was put to the test and passed with flying colours. It was seconds before we were up on the 20th floor. The public areas on the 20th floor are very well maintained and certainly up to a 4* level. Upon entering the room we were blown away. There was a small reception area leading to the bathroom and a mirrored wardrobe directly in front of us. To the right was a small walk through to the main bedroom and a glorious Heavenly King Bed, a sofa, chair and desk and a rounded window which had one of the best views I have ever seen in any hotel throughout the world. It really was a stunning room, the bed was perhaps the best I have ever experienced and most importantly it was spotless, with no sign of the wear and tear mentioned in other reviews. The bathroom was also spotless and a nice size. The much talked about Heavenly Shower was outstanding, again one of the best I have ever experienced and a nice vanity area with plenty of towels included as well. To top the room as a whole off, there were his and her robes, an ironing board/iron and an easy to use safe. What more could you want? It really was a 10/10 room. A really big issue at the Westin seems to be the wait for the elevators. There was on occasions a sign up saying that due to the number of people staying at the hotel there may be a wait, but I would say we had to wait a minute most each time and this was over Memorial Weekend and also with a few large conferences taking place. It really isnâ€™t as much of a deal as some previous reviewers have made out. We didnâ€™t dine in the Cornerstone CafÃ© in the Westin as there are so many great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. We did however have breakfast a couple of times in the 5th Avenue CafÃ© and we found this to be good value. There was a special available each morning of a pastry and coffee for $3.00 which was a great deal, and the service was always spot on as well. We didnâ€™t experience the lack of seats/tables like some have on here but if the room was full, I would expect people to utilise the seats in the lobby. It really isnâ€™t such a big deal. Another huge plus point for the hotel is the pool area and hot tub. My Wife enjoyed heading down to the 5th floor for this on a daily basis and her experience was very positive. As for location, well I doubt it can be beaten in Seattle, minutes from the best shopping and attractions in the Seattle, all within an easy walk. I did laugh earlier when I read a review stating that Pike Place and the Waterfront were a bit of a trek from the Westin, it really isnâ€™t very far at all. 5 minutes on foot to Pike Place and then just a short walk down (easier than up) to the Waterfront. It is quite hilly, but that is Seattle. For easier access to the Waterfront, I would recommend the 99 bus which is free and goes up 1st and around via the Waterfront. Seattle Center was easily reachable via the Monorail (station 2 minutes walk from the hotel) and a 90 second train journey but you could easily walk there as well. The area seemed very safe at day and night with plenty of people about. There was also a station for the Lake Union Streetcar directly across from the hotel which was another transportation option available. Overall, this is a great hotel in a fantastic location. I would definitely take some of the reviews which have heavily criticised the hotel with a pinch of salt. This is easily a 4* property. As for Seattle, what a wonderful city and we both canâ€™t wait to return again in the future. Highly recommended all round.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR115453474">"We're a convention hotel," the guy checking me in told me. As one of the few non convention goers at the Westin that night I was given a 37th floor room with a great view. It took at least 10 minutes to make it up there when I did it sounded like there were 5 or 6 screaming children in the next room. At 9pm my boyfriend and I were conversing at normal volume when we heard a knock at the door. It was security, requesting that we quiet down. I immediately called Service Express and requested a room change which they said was fine. However, once downstairs it turned into a huge ordeal and after waiting in the lobby for over an hour we were sent up to a lower room in the South Tower with no view. When we got up there our keys didn't work and after calling the front desk (they told us security would be right up) we sat outside the room for another hour before being let in and still not given a working key. The hotel gave us a $50 voucher for room service an said our PayPer View would be free. However, they ended up charging me for everything a week later. It does seem like it would be a great place to attend a convention, though, and the pool and hot tub are quite nice if you make it there before the throngs of children.

Pike Place Market is just down the road, most of the higher end shopping is nearby and the tram you can take to the Seattle center is nearby as well, though it is also within walking distance. My only complaint is that they charge a ton for parking and aren't exactly fast getting you your vehicle when you want it if they are at all busy at the time.

Overall, we had a good experience at the hotel and would stay there again. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. We checked in very quickly without any problems. We were very impressed with the room. We had a Deluxe King with a water view and it was definitely worth the extra $10. We had a fantastic view of the Sound with the Space Needle also clearly visible from our room. The panoramic window meant we had a very impressive expanse to enjoy. One big disappointment we found was that the business center cost something like $8 for 15 minutes of internet usage. We had planned on using the center to print off our boarding passes for the return trip, but ended up doing it elsewhere. At other hotel chains, the business center has always been complimentary. Breakfast was a part of the package we purchased. It was a rather basic breakfast from the cafe located in the lobby. It was a decent value, but nothing spectacular. The second day we had the food delivered to our room and it was much better than eating in the loud cafe. Our other complaint is with the concierge. We dealt with both a man and a woman concierge, and neither of them were particularly helpful or friendly. The woman was borderline rude at times, both with us and with other hotel guests. Compared with the incredibly helpful concierges I've dealt with at other hotels, it was a major disappointment. It's nice to have someone available to help with scheduling car rentals, tours, and the like, but in this case, I would recommend just doing it yourself.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR114774081">I stayed here because the conference was held here &amp; did not want the hassle of getting from one hotel to another for each day's meetings. I made my reservation in late January, asking for an upper floor - I only found out on check-in that double-bedded rooms were all on lower floors, so I got a room on the 8th floor of the South Tower - looking out onto the back roof of some building. For $200/night, there was a small coffee-maker, no microwave; very comfortable beds/bedding, large bathroom with hairdryer &amp; iron provided. It was almost an exercise in futility locating the Gym &amp; pool - no maps or directions provided in the room. All in all, a strange experience<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114745217">Although we got a great rate ($129) through Priceline for a last minute room on a Saturday night in June, I would never pay the average full price for rooms here (about $229 a night). The bathrooms leave something to be desired--something I judge a room by strongly. Room 1155 is right by the elevators which ding each time they stop at the floor. Understandably we were probably put in a "value" room since we booked through Priceline but I expected more from the Westin brand of hotels. The room also had an odd odor to it. The views are probably pretty fabulous the higher up you go and the room layout makes it so the beds face outward- a big plus at nighttime. Our tower had 44 floors, we were on the 11th. The room and hotel itself was good but I was surprised there wasn't more luxury to the rooms here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR114725437">Booked direct with hotel.

It was a partying hotel with vomit in the elevators and lots of drunks everywhere. Very scary for children and old seniors. Next stay, checked in at 5 and our rooms were not ready till after 10 that night waited around with the kids and grandparents .

The Seattle Westin is a nice hotel with a great downtown location. With rolling luggage you can easily walk from the nearby underground Westlake Light Rail Station to the hotel. (The Light Rail is the bargin way to get from the SEA TAC airport to downtown Seattle.) There are ample dining opportunities within easy walking distance of the hotel, including a McDonalds. It is a 1 block walk to the monorail station that will take you to the Space Needle. The hotel has an indoor pool which was nicer than I expected. Some rooms have a water view of Puget Sound. Our room had a view of the Space Needle. Not bad. It's an easy 3 or 4 block walk to Pike Place Market. Nordstroms and Macys are 1 block away. When we go back to Seattle (we had a great time) we will, more than likely, return to the Westin. One closing comment. I have heard parking at the hotel is expensive.That did not apply to us.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113271671">My boyfriend and I stayed here in mid-June for a wedding in downtown Seattle. The location can't be beat - a third of a mile to Pike Place market, and tons of restaurants and the Space Needle within easy walking distance. Although the service was typical Westin and very conscientious, I would say that the hotel itself beyond the lobby is falling a bit behind the standard set by all of the other Westin properties in my experience. We were initially given a room in the South tower on the 25th floor (although there are 40+ floors, apparently the 25th floor is one of the exclusive Starwood Preferred Guest floors). We were a little dismayed that the room was visibly dusty (even in the bathroom), and that the couch and chest of drawers were visibly dingy. Although tired from a 6-hour flight, we asked downstairs at the front desk for a better room, and were given the key to a room in the North Tower on the 24th floor. This tower and level were a bit better - the common area itself upon exiting the elevator was better, and room #2 was cleaner, and had a better shower. The bed was awesome (typical Westin), and the view was awesome. My advice about the parking is NOT to park in Westin's hotel-owned deck, but to park in the public deck (that - confusingly enough - has a blue Westin sign on the 5th Ave. entrance). it costs $22 per night and is connected to the hotel via a covered aerial walkway. Parking in the Westin-owned deck on Stewart St. is double the price of the private deck. By the way, the front desk representative (Marissa - very nice and knowledgeable) mentioned that the rooms were dur for renovations sometime this year. That should really improve the quality of this property!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR113175258">We live in Seattle and chose the Westin for a "staycation" anniversary weekend. It had been a few years since we spent the night and with new condos built up around the Westin, it is definitely worth the splurge for the highest floors to ensure unobstructed views of the water. There was a convention that weekend and a very large amount of cruise ship passengers but we didn't feel as if that compromised our stay. Our room was quiet and private, the front desk staff graciously provided us with a very late check-out time, and surprised us with Champagne and Strawberries. The pool was nice but wouldn't go into the foamy hot tub filled with kids. The central location of the Westin and amazing views (splurge for the highest floors!) makes it one of the best hotels in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113171937">I am frequently in Seattle and have stayed at this hotel many times over the last 30 years for both business and pleasure. The view, if you are on a high floor, can be spectacular and my room this last week was the best yet - a sweeping vista of the Sound from the cruise dock on the south end up to Magnolia. Ask for a room with a westward view although fair to stay that I have never had a view that wasn't pretty interesting. That said, the decor is looking a bit dated and worn. The carpet in my room, as an example, was a bit dirty and thin. Service could be much better as well. I had room service the first night and when I left, the dirty dishes were still sitting in the hallway for pick up some 3 days later. And as to the take away restaurant in the lobby, they were asking $2.20 for a single banana. Just avoid the place, there are lots of places to eat within 2 blocks walk. Overall, just average but could be so much better with just a little effort.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR112110072">We stayed at the Seattle Westin for one night prior to a cruise.

It is also very centrally located in terms of touristic sites, restaurants, etc. Moreover, the rooms are beautiful semi-suites and the service is very efficient and friendly. The only drawback is the design of the hotel itself: two 45 story towers each of which has only four elevators. If there is a conference going on (which seems to frequently be the case), you may have to wait 15 minutes to get onto one. It is not easy to see what can be done about it at this stage. Management puts out signs urging patience, but that really doesn't solve the problem. We were told that an effort had been made to put conference attendees (of which my wife was one) into the same tower for convenience, but this policy may need rethinking since it means that everybody in the tower has the exact same schedule regarding elevator use.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR112037613">a very nice experience very friendly people good service<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR111877779">I never write hotels reviews, but this time I feel compelled to it due to the caring and professional service I encountered at the Westin Seattle. I was a lecturer in a conference held at the hotel, so I did not pay for the room. Therefore, I am unable to comment about the price/quality ratio. I also tend to dislike business hotels and rather stay in small boutique or grand classic hotels. But the Westin Seattle is ideally located, in a clean and safe street, close to shops, restaurants and the fantastic Pike Market. The hotel is in need of a renovation -although I understand that a major one will take place this year-. But the lobby is pleasant, spacious and well maintained. The rooms are of a good size -specially when compared to European standards- , extremely clean, the bathrooms good sized and the amenities were good too. The staff does a good job keeping the rooms comfortable and helping the guests in every possible manner. I was assigned a large room with a comfortable king size bed. I went to bed and, at two in the morning I woke up unable to breathe. I am allergic to insect bites (some more than others) and know an anaphylactic reaction. And I always keep my emergency medication for such reaction at hand. That night it laid in the nightable. I could administer the medication on time and was able to breath again, when I discovered that my whole left arm and leg were covered in bloody dots. I knew that I had been bitten by an animal and called the front desk. A security team arrived immediately. They explained me about bed bugs -I had never heard about them- and that they are becoming a problem in the USA. Although they did not have that problem at the hotel, they couldnt rule it out. When I left, they had isolated the room and were about to bring dogs trained to find bugs -another thing I had never heard of'-. I was immediately moved to a suite at the last floor. Way too big for me. I could comment on the decor (after all, I am an architect) but the room was spacious and had a fantastic view. The hotel managers on duty (Michael and Mohamed) were at all times kind and concerned. An appointment with the doctor was arranged for me and the doctor could count over 90 bites on my leg and arm but was not sure which animal caused it. It was a pretty horrid experience, but the hotel staff went through great lengths of pain to assure that I could do my job and have a pleasant stay. I also had an important dinner party, for which I had bough a pretty Channel dress -short skirt and sleeveless- which I could no longer wear due to the extensive rash and scaring of my arm and leg. The hotel took over the expenses of a new pants outfit -no Cahnnel this time, though-. What makes the most of a stay in a hotel is the attitude the owners and staff have towards their guests and customers. Regardless how modest or elegant the hotel would be, if the owners, managers and staff have the mission to be sure that their guests have a pleasant stay, then you can be assured that you are in a good hotel. The way how the staff at the Westin Seattle took responsibility on a potentially serious matter and the delicacy and warmth of their approach to it makes it clear that everybody involved in the business of managing a hotel know what they are doing. I hope that more hotels -or business in general- could see that costumers' safety and comfort are the priority. Thank you to the staff at the Westin Seattle. Placing the bugs aside, I recommend the hotel highly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR111125628">My wife and I stayed here for our lay over before a cruise out of Seattle.

The staff couldn't have been better, especially at the concierge desk. The rooms were quiet, the elevators weren't too slow, the location is fabulous. However, the hotel just charges too much. Pay for internet access in the business center when there is free wireless in the lobby (ask for the password from the concierge)? $7 to store your own food in the mini-bar (you can get a free mini-fridge instead by phoning down for one)? We parked in the lot up the street for $22, best you'll do in that area, really. There is a mezzanine walkway from the lot into the hotel. If you park at the Westin itself it'll cost a lot more.

Read some reviews that inferred that this may lower the level of service or quality of room we'd get. Not true at all. The hotel was busy with the start of cruise ship season yet the check in was quick and attentive ensuring that we got the best room available at the time. I believe her name was Jen. She even sent up a non-alcoholic bottle of wine and a card for our anniversary. Although the elevators seem a bit wild, we didn't have to wait any longer than normal. Any issue was parking as their lot was full upon our arrival. Easy solution, just do a loop around the building and pull into the "westin parking lot". It is actually not part of the hotel but uses the name - go figure. It was $22 to park for 24 hours with in/out.

However on the very large desk in my room was a card warning about wind noise with an offer of ear plugs from room service. I watched TV for a while and went to bed. Around 11 pm the room started vibrating, the windows rattled and the bed frame was actually hitting the back wall of the room. I got the earplugs which didn't help at all and hardly slept a wink. In the morning i was offered free breakfast at checkout, but had already paid for it so not much use by then.

The other check in clerk overheard our conversation, and whispered in her ear in front of me. The first clerk then quickly changed her mind and we could only stay in double beds room because my booking was done through priceline. Did not feel valued as a guest, made me felt unwanted. This is the second time I stayed at the Westin through priceline and both times I felt unvalued. If I got to pick the 4 stars hotel in the Seattle area, I would not have stayed at the Westin at all.

With so many bookings, I have often been capable of getting Westin bookings with a little experience in looking through the options before booking - maybe just luck. Luck that was until this past weekend at the Seattle Westin. There are many positive comments on this sight, and my guess is that those patrons are not Hotwire customers. I believe this hotel is capable of 4 - star status, but they save those rooms and service for their full charge customers. The room was dirty and cramped, and the bed was VERY uncomfortable. This was probably the worst night's sleep ever. The comments about the elevator service are completely accurate. Plan up to 30 minutes wait for an elevator to get down. I noticed a several comments about the high parking rates in several of the posts, but none that are current for May 2011. They must have raised the parking rates in the past couple of weeks as well - self serve (including tax) is now $41 and valet $43. Think the $2 additional charge for valet is worth it? Plan up to another hour to get your car out. The sign on the garage says $28 daily and in very tiny font "plus tax" - the tax is $13 for a grand total of $41 self-serve parking. When we returned to the hotel on Saturday at 5:30, we found a parking place on the street next to the entrance of the self-parking garage. We placed a couple of quarters in the meter, put the meter ticket on the side window, and enjoyed free parking from 6:00 pm Saturday through all day Sunday. The best part about this hotel is the location - easy walking distance all around down town and to Pikes market. Here's the kicker - my teenage sons are baseball fans, and our family vacations are usually planned around touring major league parks and taking in a game or two. (Yes, we spent Mother's Day at Safeco Field watching the Mariners.) We met several season ticket holders at the game on Sunday and were quick to ask about the tv/cable system that didn't show home Mariner's games in Seattle. They had no idea what we were talking about. We continued to explain that the previous night we had returned to our hotel room planning to watch the end of the Mariner's game, but we were unable to find it on the TV. We called down to the front desk, and we were told that the game was only available in the lounge, not in the rooms. The fans we met all laughed and told us that the games are all carried in the basic cable package that even Motel 6 has. This is a 4-star hotel? It just seems weird that the Westin would not offer something so basic.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR107358255">We stayed at the Westin in June 2010.

However, a comment on how I was treated as a Hotwire customer: At arrival the receptionist girl noted somehow "ok you booked over Hotwire"... And we (me and my girlfriend) got a room with two separate beds (not that I really care about that, I just felt that this was done on purpose). I think that the girl at the reception tried to get somehow arrogant in the same sense as the hotel management in some replies here such as "we want to give people the opportunity to stay at our hotel which would not be able to afford it otherwise" (no exact quote but I read similar I believe).

The concierges throughout the stay were very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to eat. Overall, the service was great but the hotel itself needs a facelift. The lobby and lounge area were fine but the room was lacking some amenities such as shower caps, body wash, and no privacy sign which resulted in being woken up early by the room attendant trying to get into the room.

However, if you are one of the floor at a higher level as I was, then beware, you hear crackling sounds or rather creeking sounds.

We called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up for us in the service elevator - no one every did show up. We finally squeezed into an elevator going up and stopped at every floor where others were waiting for the elevator (too bad for them, there was no room in the elevator). When we reached the top floor, we then went back down to the lobby stopping at every floor and saying 'sorry' to everyone else waiting. This was the story every time we went up and down in the elevator - ridiculous. I also found the concierge and the front desk staff to be quite rude. Instead of offering my kids the welcome package, I had to ask. And when I asked, I got a roll of the eyes and an 'I'll check if there are any' answer. Westin should not promote such amenities if they don't do it willingly and voluntarily. Parking was also a whopping $43 for valet and $41 for self-park.

Being owners at the Westin, Palm Springs location and having stayed at various Westins, we knew we were in for a real treat. Unfortunately, for this stay our experience was not so positive. Some of the basic services that we would expect at any hotel chain did not pan out for us. For instance, the safe did not work, the showers were tepid, and the elevators were extremely slow. On our check out day we waited half an hour for the elevator that never did arrive. We ended up having to walk down 4 flights of stairs with all our luggage and were not able to get out of the hotel due to the signage saying: emerengy, fire exit only. We reentered the hallway and phoned down to the front desk where they said they would send the service elevator to us. We waited 15 minutes for the service elevator and it still did not arrive? We finally found a different set of stairs that took us out to the Lobby? Some of the Westin luxuries that we have always received were also not followed through with: no bath robes, no glasses - the first night I had two glasses in my room, but the second night I was left with 4 paper cups - really no bottle opener - I was not able to keep it in the room as it was the last opener in the hotel according to person that delivered it to the room. Wow, 40 plus floors per tower and only one bottle opener, you may want to check into this. The first night we had enough coffee for each of us to have a cup the second night we only had one coffee pack? Again, the above mentioned items may appear small, but to top it all off I had to wait 10-15 minutes each and every time I wanted to use the elevator. The kids wanted to use the pool and we had to wait for the elevator. Once we arrived at the pool the water was ice cold and we never did go back to the pool. I am not a person that likes to complain, but Westin hotel did not live up to its reputation. I own a Westin time share in Mission Hills, California, and I know the standard of quality that is provided there. The Seattle Westin did not provide me and my family with this experience. I emailed the Hotel and have yet to receive a response.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR105820523">It's interesting to see sometimes how those that review rooms say they are treated upon checkin if they arrive on a Priceline/Hotwire reservation, vs. one that is directly booked through the Hotel. I'm a SPG member, and 99% of the time, will book directlry through them to ensure I maximize my starpoints and get 'extras' when I can. This time, on a whim, I ended up with the Westin Seattle through Priceline for half what the AAA rate was. I checked in very late, and it was quick and friendly. I originally ended up on a high floor, but the two full beds were too much. I called and asked if I could have a room with a single bed, and they offered me a queen accessable or a Westin Workout with a King. I took the latter. The room was great! I didn't have to trott through the hotel in my sweats to go workout, the treadmill and weights were in my room, including a set of extra towels, wipes, and other workout toiletries. There was an extensive collection of Yoga equipment, which was no use to me, but I didn't care. The room was no additional charge, which was nice, because they usually rent at several dollars more a night then the deluxe rooms. The view was the best I ever had staying at the Westin. Great view of downtown and Elliot Bay with the ferries coming in from Bainbridge and Bremerton. The fact that Westin/Starwood offered me this great upgrade, not knowing that I was a SPG member and booking through Priceline really delighted me and will keep me loyal. Only downsides to the experience were the lack of any toiletries in the bathroom upon arrrival (they were restocked on the second night) and on the second day, water bottles magically appeared where there were none before. Wifi is expensive, but the lounge is open and free. Parking is expensive for valet ($40/day) and self parking is still steep at $22. For anyone that is looking for a great way to keep up with their fitness regimine, I highly recommend the workout room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR105478696">We really couldn't have hoped for a nicer stay on our first trip to the US.

(Beltown, space needle, pike market, just about everything) The hotel itself is nice and the rooms are spacious and what you expect of a Westin. The rooms are slightly noisier then i want in a hotel, being able to hear my neighbors quite a bit. BUt not horrible. What is horrible about this hotel is it's elevator system. It easily ranks as one of the worst I have ever seen. There are three elevators to service each tower. I was on the 25th floor and on average I always waited a minimum of 5 minutes(seriously no exaggeration at all) upwards of ten. on the 25th floor I always had to stop about 10 times coming down. One of my coworkers was on the 11th floor and his wait was even longer, because almost every time the elevator got to his floor it was full. He actually started using the stairs most of the time because of how horrible they where. Would I stay there again, I love Westins, they are my favorite hotels, but the elevator deal is almost a deal breaker. That inconvenient.. Outside of that, it's a great hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR105202535">Having stayed at the Westin in Bellevue a few times, I decided to try the Seattle one again and was slightly dissapointed. The Westin in Bellevue is much nicer! The first time I visited the Westin Seattle hotel was in 1995, and it has definitely lost its glory since then. The lifts seem old, and everything is quite dated. You definitely see that in all the detail (door handles, bathroom etc). The rooms are equipped with the wonderful heavenly beds and the signature Westin showers, but apart from that the rooms makes you feel that you go back in time. The valet parking is extremely expensive. The highest I've ever seen at $43. The gym is also split between two rooms, and with no windows, so felt stuffy. The gym was packed at 6am in the morning, and not a spare treadmill or crosstrainer to find.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR105200818">Enjoyed staying there on business. Beautiful room but it would be great if they provided bottled water and had the clock next to the bed instead of behind it. Walls are a little thin. The bed was comfy and the room was spacious. the place is mostly very nice and well run. Like the workout center and lobby bar.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR103961371">First of all, I think they gave me the worst room, only a queen size bed, and a room that seemed to be part of a larger suite as there was a adjoining room b/c I got a deal on hotwire for $89... check in, lady was indifferent to me checking in, told me they had no king, just queen or double, I chose double, little did I know it was a Murphy bed! An uncomfortable murphy bed in a westin, like come on!!! Room wasn't clean, used stir stick on the floor, hair on couch, carpet dirty. Washroom was small. Elevators were dirty, writing on wall, fingerprints on doors, buttons worn out. If this is what a westin is like, I'll never go back, I feel like writing in and getting a refund. I parked across street for $30 as cheaper than valet at westin. I don't know, there's so many nicer hotels in this place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR103941940">We loved the Westin. The service was superb. They took care of every request promptly and courteously. Our convention rate made it very reasonable to stay there. The view of the space needle and the city were breathtaking from our room on the 45th floor. The room was clean with nice bedding and bathrooms. My only complaint is that the Fifth Avenue Restaurant is the only place in the hotel that is open for breakfast, and I did not consider it adequate. It was noisy and too small for the number of customers. Customers have to stand in line to order their food, which was nothing special. The restaurant was not worthy of this fine hotel. Go to Lola's for a much nicer breakfast experience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR102773635">How bad can a 4-star hotel be? Stay at the Westin and you'll find out. Here are some tips to enjoy your stay at the Westin: - ask for earplugs when you check in - don't expect good service. I think there is a service charge for smiles. - don't expect a clean room While the location is great, it cannot compensate for the horrible night's sleep, poor service, and unclean room. First, the room had an incessant creaking. It was one of those noises that you notice during the day, but in the quiet of the night, it gets progressively louder and louder and more annoying. If it was just my wife and I, we would have requested to move. But with small children already settled in and sleeping, we suffered through the night. I could not understand how they could rent a room that creaked like a haunted house. The next morning, I got my answer when I complained to the front desk. When you check in, they are *supposed* to give you a sheet of paper explaining that the creaking is caused by a safety feature for windstorms and offering earplugs. Unfortunately, nobody communicated this during my check in. This brings me to my second point: service. The worst part of the service was the stark lack of empathy the front desk expressed when I calmly described my night. I would have expected at least something like "I'm really *sorry* no one told you about the creaking. It must have been a horrible night.", instead all I got was a sheet of paper explaining the creaking one day too late. Note to management: verbal apologies do not cost you any money! When I told them I was never booking with them again, the front desk didn't seem surprised. I guess they hear that a lot. Third, other reviews have mentioned blood in the sheets, and dried urine on the toilet seat. My stay was consistent with the sub-par housekeeping with: - stained sheets - dirty coffee cups The Westin should be ashamed of itself.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR102698286">I had read some bad reviews of this hotel before I left for my trip and I was worried, but I was pleasantly surprised. We had wonderful service from the bell station that greeted us to the person checking us in. The staff directed us to a great sports bar, (The Fox), to watch the Final Four. We had a wonderful view from the 36th floor and a very clean and spacious room. I walked to Pikes Street Market in the afternoon. It was also close to Nordstrom and Macys for shopping. I would go back here again. I was lucky to get a great price on Priceline, so the value was wonderful. I don't usually use Priceline but we just needed a one night stay in Seattle on our way home and I was lucky to land here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR102465497">We just stayed three nights at the Westin in DT Seattle. Really a great location but the hotel itself is tired. Carpet in the room stained and worn, shower has very little pressure. The beds are still good, nice view. Three out of four conciere were not very helpful and you could tell they either got some form of kick back from recommended restaurants or had some incentive. I asked about non chain medium priced values near the hotel and she handed me a coupon book and suggested a chain. We found places on our own and had done research previous to arriving but thought there might be some "gems" they could suggest. Parking is another issue, $36 per day for self park ouch!

On arrival, promise of personal service &amp; room in North tower away from elevator turned into South tower directly in front of the elevator. They just don't seem as intent on taking care of loyal customers as every other SPG hotel we've stayed at. Despite ideal location, we won't be back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR101900444">The Westin was perfect for our trip. I combined my business trip with a mini-family vacation. Thanks to other reviewers, I remembered to ask the hotel for an extra fridge, and a step-stool which made our stay with a 3 1/2 year old much easier. It was great having a little sofa in our room so we weren't all stuck sitting on the bed or on the floor. We enjoyed the pool too, although I thought it was overly-chlorinated. If you plan to use mass transportation to see the sites around Seattle, the Westin's location can't be beat. The monorail to Seattle Center and light-rail to the airport are about a short block away. Several family-friendly restaurants, a food court at the mall across the street, and Starbucks, of course, are all nearby - meaning w/in a two-block radius (that was really important to us being with a toddler!) The cafe in the hotel offered an inexpensive breakfast option - coffee and pastry for $5. While a bit on the older side, the Westin is very comfortable and clean. Bed was super comfortable with crisp, white-linen sheets. The concierge was very helpful and staff were all friendly. If you're looking for something more modern with high-end shopping in front of your eyes, might want to consider the Grant Hyatt although it is farther from mass transportation. The Westin was perfect for us, though, and if we visit Seattle again, we'd probably stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100993775">I stayed at the Westin this past Saturday night with some girlfriends. I have stayed at this particular location probably about 5 times in the last 2 years. I used to love the place, comfy beds, clean, nice staff. This last visit however has soured me on it forever. first problem: When one of my friends called down to request more coffee for the room, the woman was quite rude, and refused to send more than 2 packets, she asked for 4. When the person brought the coffee to the room it was shoved at her and he stalked off down the hall. Problem 2: During all my previous stays at this hotel I have made local calls from the room phone at no charge. This time I made 2 calls that were each about 15 minutes in duration and was charged 30 dollars. FOR A LOCAL CALL!! It was not posted ANYWHERE in the room about phone charges. I did complain and they did reverse it, first offering 50% off and then when I told them that was unacceptable they took it all off. So yes they did fix the problem. But that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. Problem number 3 and this is the huge one. I have a lovely cluster of insect bites on my leg that look suspiciously like bed bug bites. I am absolutely furious at the moment, because I did not notice the bites until I got home, and now my luggage and stuff has been sitting in my apartment for over 12 hours, potentially allowing the vermin that were in the hotel room to enter my home. It makes me sick.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100690512">Dated Hotel. Great Location. Really nice rooms. Functional Lobby. Friendly Staff. Upgraded - without asking. Nice. Would NEVER stay here again though and would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is doing any type of business and wants to connect to the internet in the lobby. It's 1:39am. There is NO ONE connected to the internet in the lobby but me - NO ONE.... At best I am getting 15kb/s. I asked the front desk if it was normal that the connectivity is this slow and she said because the hotel is quite full that the internet is slow - I pointed out that it was past 1am and that I was the only person in the lobby on a computer - in fact at that point there were only 6 people in the lobby and 3 were staff. She didn't suggest that I call tech support. After sitting down for a few moments I got up again went to the front desk and asked if there was a tech support person I could talk too. She told me to use a house phone and ask for tech support. I called and got a person on the phone who explained that the lobby was limited to 128kb/s and that it was shared with everyone in the lobby - I pointed out that I was the only person in the lobby using the internet - she said that the front desk uses it as well....really? wireless at the front desk....?? Anyway I asked if I went to my room and bought the wireless internet - would it work well? She said it would, because it was a different service. Polite - but essentially useless. I can't use the internet in the room because my wife is sleeping in our room and the light of the computer and the sound of the keyboard will disturb her. What kind of company TODAY in Seattle, WA USA cannot have an adequate speed internet in its lobby. Shame on you Westin - where else are you skimping? Although the hotel is adequate - I will NEVER stay here again. There are many other choices in Seattle. Great WIFI is a GIVEN. There is no excuse for this NONE. If tech support had said there was a problem - that would have been frustrating - but completely different story. Apparently this is "normal". That makes the Westin Seattle a dinosaur. At least it will have future value as oil thousands of years from now.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100619173">A recent trip to the Westin Seattle left me frustrated and angry.

She told him no and he put them back. She was charged $7.00 for that. She was also charged another $7.00 for using the refrigerator. Adding insult to injury, neither of us could talk to anyone at the front desk about these charges. They only take inquiries by email for billing issues.

The rooms were clean and quiet and nicely furnished.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR100062255">Stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday night in March. We got a great deal on Priceline, so I was quite chuffed with my win. Location: Great! It is right on Stewart and 5th so it is fairly central and we were able to walk everywhere (we did not use the car once) and the neighbourhood felt safe. Service: About average. We were able to check-in fairly early - 12:30PM - and the front desk staff who checked us in was nice. Not overly helpful, but nice enough. When we got to our room, our safe was locked, so we called to get it unlocked. Security was there within 2 minutes (I am not exaggerating) and got it unlocked in no time. Room: We were assigned a room on the 31st floor overlooking Puget Sound, so that was really nice. We got a room with 2 double beds - I asked for a king, but they said because I booked with Priceline, I only get whatever they give me, which was fair enough. The rooms are looking a bit old, but hey, the beds were comfy and I paid $69/night so I am not complaining. HOWEVER, I will complain about the water pressure in the shower, which was non-existent. I don't know if the lack of H20 pressure is due to us getting a room on the 31st floor, but it was bad. It was so bad that my husband could not get any water running in the sink while I was in the shower. I think the lack of water pressure could be a deal-breaker for us - we love our hot, steamy showers, but if showering leaves us feeling cold and unclean, then I don't think we will be returning. But then again, the beds were comfy so I COULD be convinced. Maybe. Bottom line: at $69/night, I might be convinced to go back because the beds were comfy and I had a good night's sleep. However, the shower situation is terrible so it would have me concerned especially because I get the feeling that Priceline customers do not get treated as well as the non-priceline ones. Based on my experience, I would definitely not pay more than $95 to stay here, even during the summer. My rating: 2.5 stars, but I am rounding up because of the location and the price that I paid for my stay. If I had paid more than what I did, I'd definitely give it 1.5 stars, maybe even rounded down to a 1 star. Wi-fi Tip: Wi-fi in-room is $9.95/24 hrs, but is free in the lobby. Parking Tip: The hotel wanted $38 for valet parking, so we parked next door in the Westin Building on 5th Avenue and Virginia (it is connected to the hotel via a skybridge). For $22/day with in and out privileges, I thought it was a good deal compared to what the hotel wanted.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR99189044">My husband and I stayed here for a date night out away from the kids. Only $ 86 on Hotwire. I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews about poor service and less than perfect housekeeping. We were very happy with what we got for the price. You can't find a better location for shopping and dining. Easy walk to Pike Place and the waterfront. The service was great, easy check- in and a late check- out. The room did smell musty and it was dusty. The hotel needs updating, but the bed was comfy and the hotel was quiet. We needed extra TP and it was delivered within 5 minutes of our call.

The rooms were nice enough, clean and we had a nice view of the Space Needle. The bathroom was very small and there were not any bathrobes. Be prepared to shell out $36 bucks for parking in their self-park parking garage. Apparently this weekend was very busy for them so finding a parking spot in the garage was a little difficult and a semi truck was blocking the entrance to the self-park garage which made things a little chaotic. We also experienced unusually long lines upon check in. The front desk staff was very friendly, the valet staff seemed overwhelmed. We will probably stay at the W or Sheraton next time around.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR98109442">I booked this room on Priceline.com and got it for a decent price. I couldn't imagine if we'd booked at the going rate, however. I would have been very, very displeased. When we checked in to our king sized room, my husband noticed an old urine stain on the toilet seat. Gross, but when we mentioned it to the front desk, it was handled extremely efficiently and definitely to our satisfaction. The room was, "meh", but large and the view spectacular. I didn't want my 4 year old playing on the carpet or sitting on the furniture, so I had her stay on the bed with her toys and blankie. The carpet is very old, stained, dusty, and has tears in it. The walls were stained and the furniture gave me the creeps. The bed was very comfortable, clean, and updated. The TV was a flat panel and rather newish. Bathroom was quite nice and the shower was amazing. Great water pressure; seemed updated to us. The soap was a huge hit with our daughter because it was leaf shaped and smelled quite nice. No free WiFi - 7 bucks for the day. We had checked in after a long day returning from Disneyland and were looking for somewhere to eat and the front desk suggested a place within a very short walking distance from the hotel in a mall. It was great. The hotel's room service prices were WAY too high for our liking. The pool area was lovely and exceptionally clean; hot tub was as well. Our daughter was able to stand on her toes in the shallow end (she's 42" tall), but there is a slope drop-off, so make sure you're with your smaller kids at all times. Looked as though the patio off the pool area would be really nice in the warmer months as well. We had over the top, fantastic service from the bellhops, especially John, (HUGE kudos to him; he even tied my little girl's shoelaces) and all the other service staff were courteous and friendly, save for the Concierge fellow. He was a bit, um, off, to say the least. We felt we were wasting his time, instead of him helping us expedite ours. Overall, an okay stay, however, I'd stay somewhere else until their reno's are done. But, I can only imagine I won't quite get the deal I did on Priceline when that comes. ;-) I say "no" to recommending this hotel for now because there isn't a choice for "maybe later".<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR98044667">Well Obama stays here so what can you say but it is pretty nice indeed!

And they threaten to fine you if you use the fridge! A bit strange but all in all it was a very comfortable stay. The only issue we had with Seattle was there is so many homeless people here it is a bit of a problem, we were even hassled in the lobby of the hotel once whilst sitting there, and many times when we walked out the front!

What a disappointment for her, and for us, when she saw how "shabby" the rooms were for what she paid (over $200/night); worn out carpeting, &amp; stale cigarette odors, inpatient employees. Even though our daughter lives part time in Seattle, we checked with the concierge for some tips, he made us feel like we were taking up his time. The cafe was only option for breakfast where we were treated rudely and inappropriately. On our final day we had no hot water for our showers, at 10:00 a.m.!

Two block walk from hotel to Assaggio's Italian restaurant - some of the best italian food this side of Milan. Also - Top Pot, the semi-famous donut and coffee cafe is right close by.

Then, they had one of their employees (name not remembered) take us to another room that was 75 degrees. Both rooms were in the South Tower on a sunny, 40-degree day and they obviously had no cooling capability available. Third room was across from the elevator (we requested not near an elevator or ice machine) and reeked of chlorine. Why would they try to put anyone in a room with a heavy chlorine odor? Doesn't anyone on staff realize this is not a good idea? At that point, the employee assisting us put me on the phone to a supervisor named Kathryn who sarcastically said "Sooooo, Mr. XXXX, I understand we don't have any rooms that please you?". Kathryn clearly needs some remedial training in customer relations, or better yet, another job. To which I replied that all we wanted was a room with working heating/cooling that didn't reek of chlorine and wasn't next to an elevator or ice machine. Fourth room was in the North Tower and was nice, but the ice machine for that floor had been removed and not replaced. We noticed that all four of the rooms we experienced had only one drinking glass in the bathroom. Be advised that there are no bathroom exhaust fans in any of the Westin's rooms and plan on a steamy bathroom when you take a shower.

Even the service person who carried our bags said, that he would not stay in one of the rooms for this amount of money per night and said they seem to have a problem with housekeeping. Afterwards we took one room, which was acceptable (although also not in a good condition) and found several bloodstains on the bed when we were going to sleep. The next day we had an appointment with a manager, who reacted quite harsh but at least after some discussion gave us one free night (of our six nights in total).

The consierge desk in the main lobby was very helpful in getting last-minute theater tickets. Booked (ahead of time via internet) an afternoon "Gourmet Food and Wine" walking tour -- would definitely recommend it. The hotel did not rate five stars because the service was poor in the main lounge area and because of the excessive internet fee charged for internet access ($13/day).

Our room was clean and was a nice size. The bed was comfortable. Toiletries were of good quality. They have really cool leaf-shaped soap in the bathroom (I asked for an extra and took it home to my kids). My main complaint about this hotel was breakfast. The hotel has two restaurants, a Bar and Grill and a second that is more like a coffee shop. The Bar and Grill is not open for breakfast, so the coffee shop is the only breakfast option. Although it wasn't bad, it seemed to be geared more towards takeout. The menu was fairly limited, but the worst part was that it was loud and had a hectic atmosphere. Not the way to get your day off to a relaxing start. Might be okay if you're looking for a quick bite before heading out for a business meeting, but not the ambience you want if you're on a relaxing vacation or weekend trip. The other thing I noticed was that the hotel (at least our room) creaked when it was windy. This was actually disconcerting ... we were in the room the night before and it was quiet, but the next morning the room started to creak. I really thought we were having an earthquake! I realized we weren't when it lasted more than a couple of minutes. And no, it wasn't coming from the room upstairs or beside us! :) I also thought the minibar could use some improvement. There were a bunch of sodas and beer, but the only liquor available was bourbon, scotch or vodka. There was vodka but no tonic. Also no wine. The location is great. The valets were very helpful. They were able to give me good directions to locate a gas station (hard to find in downtown). The lobby bar was a nice spot to have an after dinner drink.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR89291755">We stayed at the Westin in May of this year and I can say that this hotel could be an awesome place to stay with the help of a make over...The photos that are shown on pics over the web give this Westin Too much credit..... I am not picky at all, I just see the potential in this hotel, and I hope the owners find some spare change to redo the carpets, paint the inside and outside of the building, as well as refurnish the rooms..The shower pressure could also use a boost.... Oh yea, the internet can only be accessed from the lobby unless you shell out $20 ....Not a big deal, but also "Not Kool"! The bed was amazzzzzing though!!!!! It almost made me forget about the other flaws! Great stay if you enjoy getting swallowed up by a super comfotable bed!...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR89119275">My gf and I booked this hotel through hotwire for a quick weekend getaway to Seattle. Overall we were quite happy with the hotel. The staff was friendly, especially Don, a server in the Coldwater Restaurant. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy, though being an older hotel, the sound proofing isn't great. We really enjoyed the soap and shampoos that were provided. The location is great though parking is ridiculously expensive. The hotel lot charges $36 per night and the 'discount' lot next door (on 5th, the block before the hotel) is still $22 a night. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant during happy hour which had half price bar entrees and cocktails. Overall the food was really good, and the cocktails were quite nice. The main menu looked pretty good as well. Free internet is only available in the main lobby as there is a charge to connect in room. This would be a good hotel to go to on business. While travelling for a quick vacation, it was nice, but you have to be careful about the extra charges as some are just extremely marked up.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR88876210">My stay was overshadowed by my experience with the valet service. The day started with the Valet Service breaking my key in the door upon arrival and check-in. While the Valet manager acknowledged thier mistake the incident was unfortunate. The very next day upon check-out, as I tried to leave the hotel my car would not go into 2nd gear. Upon returning to the hotel, I told the manager about the trouble I was now having with my car, and he said, he told the employee how to take the key out of a manual SAAB Turbo 900 but it was obvious that he did not get it right. Now I am out of $5500.00 dollars (Auto repair/Rental) and not even an apology. Maybe I should have walked their and stayed in the most expensive suite facing the space needle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR88682980">Time and time again as I stand jaded by brutal service and hotel properties, a Westin hotel restores my faith.

Good location in downtown Seattle, easy to walk around to nearby shopping... otherwise, overpriced for average size room, basic amenties and absolutely no extras! For such a high-end chain, they could stand to be a bit more generous. Computer use cost about 7 dollars for 15 minutes. The cafe in the lounge was open minimal hours, the service there was horrendous and the prices outrageous. What I liked least was the noise! It seemed like they purposely placed guests in adjoining rooms rather than spreading them out in this massive hotel... very disturbing and hard to sleep well. The place (including its elevators) is worn out and needs a massive overhaul. Some rooms have nice views of the city and water... but not sure I would return or recommend to anyone else. I know I would not spend much to stay there again. Neighborhood at night seemed desolate and a bit unnerving to walk around. Reception staff seemed to be tired and not too enthusiastic. Very varied type of guests from families with little kids, to business travelers, sports fans, etc... Do NOT go if you are looking for a quiet, romantic, peaceful, helpful, friendly, accessible, serviced, interesting or unique place. It is run of the mill and way overrated (staff, facilities and guest services).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR87951154">We stayed here for the wknd for a romantic getaway. The location iis great, so if you're not planning on spending much time in your room, it'll do. The price is right ($160/nt) and like I said, the location can't be beat. We had cold but clear weather, so we weren't in the room much, which is good b/c the room kinda sucked. Great views, but the bed was way to soft (the "heavenly bed" seemed like it was past its prime), the room was dated and ugly, the technology old, and the bathroom was on the small side. It was decently clean and an okay size, but the staff was hit or miss and the food was bad. It was quiet, which was nice. Overall the experience was just "blah" and I wouldn't go back.

Towers are circular, so rooms are oddly shaped (although reasonably spacious), with noisy halls. Location is good, close to shopping and the waterfront. Elevators are slow, as most traffic is vertical. Food/drink quite overpriced, even for a downtown hotel. Electronic minibars, which often malfunctionl. Westin Heavenly Beds, comfortable for some, others find them too soft. Fintess center and indoor pool were fine. Staff were attentive.

The building is a cylinder, so rooms are like a shaped like a piece of pie, with a desk centred on a huge window overlooking the city, incredible view. The lobby bar has Guinness for $4 a pint and free internet. My room was clean, with great bedding. The gym is an after thought. It's ok, gets the job done, but not an experience. Pool the same. I was at the Empress in Victoria prior to the Westin an it's pool was fantastic. Both hotels are four star. Overall good value .. it's very close to the westlake metro station, and thus free transportation within the city during the day.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR87106889">My husband and I drove down to Seattle for 2 night stay at the Westin. I was generally looking to get a great rate on Priceline, and we got a great one so overall we are happy with our stay. THE PROS: The location and service! The location cannot be beat if you are looking to be in the heart of downtown Seattle and want to do all the touristy things within walking distance. Seattle is not a great city to be driving in due to congestion and few parking spaces, so if you want to be central then this is it. We parked in the Westin (Impark) Garage next door (not underneath the hotel) that is connected by the skybridge, and it was $22/night with in&amp;out privileges. Well worth the money since we could come and go as we pleased and didn't have to worry about our vehicle. I believe the garage was pretty safe as it seemed to be manned 24/7. We walked pretty much everywhere including the Pike Place public market, and there was plenty of shopping and dining around (recommend the Mexican restaurant in Pacific Place mall). We did drive out one day to Northgate mall and congestion was bad even for a Saturday. NOTE: We noticed you can park on the streets after 6pm free of charge, but spots are really scarce, and you would have to move your car early in the morning. There were also plenty of outdoor lots you can pay to park in--your choice. You can take public transit free of charge in the downtown core free of charge as well, but we didn't take advantage of that. As for service it was great. There were always minimal waits at the check-in counter and they treated us well even though we were Priceline customers. They just mentioned we were paid in full online, and gave us our room keys with a map. We got a King room on the 17th floor with average views (of the North building and surrounding area). You can take advantage of the Green option, meaning you get $5 credit/night you choose to skip the maid service which we did. You can use this voucher for food/drinks downstairs. The average cost of a quick bite to eat down there is $8-9, and coffee is the usual $2-4. You can also opt to redeem for points instead. You can ask them for a code to use WI-FI internet free of charge in the lobby. Pay internet in rooms. My hubby mentioned it was a bit slow, but I decided to go internet free this weekend. THE CONS: Yes, parking is expensive, and if you are not happy about paying $22+ to park a night then I recommend you choose another area to stay in outside of downtown Seattle, but you would be hard-pressed to find cheap, available parking downtown if you decide to come down. People were circling Pike Street Public market thinking the would find parking--don't do it. Anyway, not Westin's fault, and we were happy with the $22 pay parking because it was secure, dry, and close. The only thing that could have made our stay better was a cleaner room. I have read previous reviewers mention the dreaded bed bugs (which btw are a major problem in many nice hotels these days), and we escaped unbitten. It is a bit unnerving, but not too sure you can tell which hotels to avoid these days since it's such a problem. We were extra vigilent and checked the bed for signs. We didn't sleep that well, but that was due to the fact the bed was a tad soft (sunk in when my husband lied down, and he's not huge), and the bed/pillows smelled a bit stale. The place was also quite dusty. I'm wondering if the cleaners are having a harder time cleaning since people are choosing the "green" option, meaning the rooms are not getting the daily cleaning it really needs considering the heavy traffic. The rooms are newly renovated and yet showed so much sign of age (sofa was stained, everything was covered in dust, and the smelly sheets/pillows). This is the only area that seemed in need of improvement. I don't need a lot of things when it comes to accommodation, but I do think cleanliness (or lack of it) leaves a lasting impression. Overall we had a good stay, and would choose the Westin again if we got it for a good rate (ie. Priceline).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR86987637">I'm a Seattle native of 27 years. My wife and I have been staying in the Westin Seattle annually for a few years, for various local getaways like the Holiday season shopping. I find the Seattle Westin to be a great sleep, custoemer service-oriented, and always an exceptional location and value. My repeat business is a good indicator of the latter as they run specials like a free $100 gift card during the Holiday season and great AAA or Corp discounts, especially for a Downtown hotel location. You can usually find a way to get some type of discount. Highs: - Exceptional bed and comfortable room for the value - Iconic Seattle hotel with great views.

We called the manager and she came to look at it and moved us to another room.

They did have strollers at the front desk for us, which was nice, but our experience was poor. We will never stay there again.

There are many hotels in Seattle and for the money we spent there must be better ones! We were traveling with 6 people spread over 3 generations &amp; we had 3 connecting bedrooms each with it's own bath. Looked perfect on paper BUT the rooms are small &amp; the baths are tiny! The decor is old, tired &amp; frankly dirty looking. The rooms are noisy, from elevator noise, loud banging doors, etc. However the view of the city was fantastic! My daughter-in-law &amp; I had both reminded the hotel several times before our arrival that we needed a babybed &amp; a refrigerator &amp; we were told on each occasion that it was no problem. However hen we arrived with tired kids we then had to call repeatedly to get both. I did have a great experience the one time I used the concierge when looking for a restaurant for an evening meal. Breakfast was ridiculous! The hotel restaurant was never yet open when we were looking for breakfast around 7 am. So we had to eat in 'snack shop' where one waited in a long line to buy overpriced mediocre food. Good location.

Check in was disappointing, the gentleman at the front desk was quick and unfriendly. We chose to self park since we had done some shopping on the way down to Seattle and did not wantg to try and get all of our bags together while the valet waited for us. We had to ask where the parking garage was and all he said was off 6th....we got outside and had to use the map (which we had to ask for since he didn't offer) to figure it out due ot the construction around the hotel. When we got to the garage the let let us through, called ahead to someone left no instructions which left us with no ticket for the parking and completely confused. So we just parked and went back to the valets who were confused and didn't know what to do with us. The room was pretty standard, although I will give you that the beds are amazing. The room needed to be dusted and there was a stain on the bed skirt as well as the floor of the bathroom. There were not any robes in the room even though they advertise there are robes in every room. On our second night in Seattle we chose to hang out in the lobby bar. Clarence served us and was amazingly attentive and friendly. We were also very impressed with the ability of the Gift Shop associates ability to upsell us that evening. She made us feel like we were getting a deal on typically hotel prices water all the time making us laugh. We are using our experience with her on our sales teams at home. We spent a fair amount of time in the lobby bar over the 3 nights days there and we consistently ignored. I wanted a drink but no one offered us anything. Yes we were working on laptops but wanted to spend money on some beverages. It left us missing Clarence from the first night. We unfortunately checked out with the same man that checked us in and again he was less than friendly.

This stay was booked on Priceline and for the price I paid, I was very pleased with the room we were booked into. I did request a room with a view and it was delivered. 42 floor of the North tower. I have no idea what the south tower rooms looked like, but ours was very good. Room is spacious, King bed angled to have a view over the city, through wall- ceiling windows. Great blackout curtains as the sun (yes, sun in Seattle) shone in the morning. Actually a wonderful site. We could also see down to Lake Union, Belltown and over to the East, Southeast of the city. Absolutely no noise at night from the street. As we were located pretty close to the ice machine and the elevator there was a bit of noise from that. I"m a light sleeper. Good size TV (not HD), lots of plug ins to charge accessories, office desk that was situated looking out the window. A sofa bed and arm chair with a small coffee table were also in the room. But it was not crowded. Coffee machine a bit different, but I liked it ...Starbucks coffee filter, into holder, place Starbucks paper cup underneath, push on and it brews one cup and shuts off. There were 2 packages of regular, 1 decaf and some Tzazo Tea packages. Internet is free in the lobby, not in the rooms Be warned, the fridge is on a sensor, don't remove anything or you're charged for the cleaning of it. Some obscene amount. Some things that did surprise me: Sheets not as soft as I would like No bathrobes (you could get them if requested) Carpet looking a little worn out No cover between bottom and sheet and mattress. Now having said that, I have never looked to see if other hotels do have a cover. If you are on a high floor, be prepared for the milk run on the way down (especially early in the morning) and if you are on a lower floor, be prepared to wait a few elevators as lots of people loaded on by the time it reaches you. OVerall, I was very pleased with our stay. I don't know if I would pay the higher rates charged by the other sites, as I think there are nicer hotels out there. Great location for walking to Belltown, Pike Place, Space Needle, and all the downtown shopping. Easy to get to from the freeway. Park in the lot next door and use the skybridge, it's only 22/night, as opposed to $32/36 that the Westin charges.

I KNOW what a bed bug is, and how it bites. I got one bed bug bite (admittedly a small attack) at the Westin Seattle. They were very relaxed about it. If you have had bed bugs, it is not like a mosquito bite, it disables you for the day. They told me that they quarintined the room (which there were no outward signs of it, after we saw the neighbor room taped off in blue tape). I then got a response from them that they brought in the team and there were no bed bugs. NOT TRUE! I KNOW bed bugs! I am now about 3 months out and the wound is finally starting to disappear.

Although a decent size I was very annoyed to be given what was obviously part of a bigger suite with a pull down bed (large single size) rather than the king size bed that I had booked months previously and as I specify as my preference on their Starwoods loyalty scheme. On complaining I was told my room had been given away earlier as I'd checked in towards the end of the day (having previously informed them that I'd arrive after midnight) which I don't think is acceptable. As I was on a business trip alone it wasn't too much of an issue but had I been with my 6ft 5 husband there is no way either of us would have got any sleep. As an apology I was offered breakfast vouchers, usually a bonus as Westin breakfasts can be great but there was only a Starbucks style cafe which was pretty dire. The location is good and the pool (although tiny) was very clean with well kept changing rooms but I was pretty fed up by the time I checked out of this hotel.

We were impressed by the location, the amenities, and operations as desribed by many reviewers on this site. We were encouraged by one reviewer to write to the wonderful Erin Huff to see if there was any possibility of up-grading to a view room. (If all hotels had staff as efficient and personable as she, the hotel industry would be set for life!) For a reasonable fee, we could snag the last Grand Vista room, which, in our case, was on the 41st floor. My wife was surprised to have a full frontal view of the Space Needle from her pillow. We arrived Friday, August 20, at a little after 1 PM and were immediately given our room cards. Yes, the lobby was indeed busy throughout our stay, but nobody was disorderly nor were there any signs of it being crowded. It is true that there is limited meal service in the Cafe, which closes at 2:00 PM, or earlier if there is no business. But for the two days we were there, I went each morning around 7 AM and put together a wonderful breakfast of juice, muffins, fruit, yoghurt, and the best steel oats oatmeal I've ever had--all for under $20 for two. The staff would assemble everything and I would take our breakfast up to the room. (There was plenty of coffee, as attendants restocked our coffee each day.) Never was there any problem with the elevator. The longest we waited was a minute on check-out day. If you have limited time in Seattle, please consider the insider's tour that is offered by Evergreen Escapes. You will feel part of this special community. The rooms are not huge, the carpets are indeed old and dark, but the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms clean and well serviced, and everything works perfectly. Of course, the view would make one forget any problems! Two blocks away are two of Tom Douglas's restaurants, Lola's and Dahlia Grill, where we dined Friday and Saturday nights. Both serve innovative Northwest cuisine with a slight emphasis on Greek food at Lola's. Less than $100 for two with drinks (wine and cocktails), tax and tip included at each establishment. Check-out can be a problem if one needs to ask any questions about the account. For this reason, the express check-out is encouraged. Problems can be handled by phing the front desk, making it unnecessary to stand in lines resembling, as one guide book puts it, "lines at SeaTac." Our cruise representative was thoroughly used to rounding up guests to transfer them to buses and to the dock, without making a spectacle in the lobby. Yes, there were many of us there, but after a short wait, the lobby emptied, and we were off to another adventure, with pleasant memories lingering of the Westin and the graciousness of Erin Huff.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR78623361">Let me preface this by saying that my husband and I are Starwood fans (Platinum members for nearly a decade). This Westin, however, should have been renovated at least 10 years ago, and wasn't -- the result is that it literally stinks throughout (in the lobby, in the hallways, in the rooms). The smell is a combination of cigarette smoke still left in the air circulation system from when not all the rooms were smoke-free, old carpeting, and simply a lot of people congregating in a place where there are no open windows anywhere, ever. I am sure an upgrade to the 1970's air circulation system could have helped. The other relic are the elevators -- they are so poorly coordinated that you inevitably get squeezed in like sardines with 20 other guests in a tiny (again, unventilated) space, going up 40+ floors. The lobby is generic, bland, and resembles an airport waiting area. The rooms/bathrooms should just be gutted and refurbished. I do not recommend this place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR78555657">had great family vacation in the Westin. the hotel has beautiful rooms. great location within walking distance of many attractions. my kids really enjoined the hotel, its comfort and the swimming pool. received grat price from hotwire so everything was perfect.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR78173381">We stayed here on a family vacation.

This is a four star hotel, rooms cost upwards of $200 night during weekdays. The business travellers leave on Friday, the hotel gets empty, and we got a very good discounted rate for Friday to Sunday nights. The hotel is located right downtown within walking distance to Pike Place, restaurants along the Pier, monorail etc. Rooms are old but have been updated. They are quite spacious. Concierge is very helpful and can get you to near the front of lineups at some of the popular restaurants around Pool is small, but is indoors, very clean with its own changing rooms and lockers Disadvantages, free wireless internet only in the lobby. But there are no computers, so you have to bring your own laptop. The Sheraton a few blocks away offers a whole bunch of computers in the lobby for use by the guests. Parking is also very expensive in the Westin lot. Use the lot beside the hotel its cheaper.

The rooms and general building were ok. The main lobby is similar to other properties (not as grand as Vancouver's). The elevators need touch up work and new carpets. The rooms are nice enough, but the bathrooms and water pressure... well it was a little like staying at a three star hotel and not a four star hotel. Parking was the highest I've ever had at a Westin - $39 USD per day... steep when I'm already paying a lot for the room. One of the main entrances is adjacent to a homeless hang out and that was intimidating on a few occasions as there could be 20-30 people hanging around. The staff make up for the less than appealing attributes (when compared with other Westin properties) - if you like Westin stay with them in Seattle, but lower your expectations on some of the usual things you'd expect from them.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR77593052">We stayed at the Westin Seattle and were able to get a great price ($95) through Priceline. The location was ideal - walking distance to Pike Place Parket and literally across the street from the train that takes you to the train station. The rooms were spacious and clean. Their lobby is huge and they offer free wi-fi in the lobby spaces, which was convenient. My only complaint was the high rate for parking (about $40 a night), however there is a parking lot literally right across the hotel for much cheaper rates. I would definitely stay here again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR77567021">The heavenly bed in room 1241 has definitely given up the ghost.

We stayed at the Westin property prior to our departure and I was very disappointed. I am a frequent business traveler and found the accommodations to be sub par to many "business type hotel/motel accommodations" - not what I expected. I found the hotel dingy, old, the pool was not clean (foamy water), the two work out areas very awkward in layout, etc. My prior experiences with Westin properties was quite different. All of this paled to the second night experience when we found a bed bug or tick crawling across our "heavenly bed" - this was the final straw and put a significan damper on the entire trip. The hotel staff was polite and formal, but I truly felt that they either were too concerned with maintaining the "corporate posture" or simply did not understand how disturbing that incident was to us as a hotel guest. I will not stay at Westin properties for a very long time and am still awaiting the report from the entomologist or exterminator!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR77278677">Got a room for 4 on Hotwire.

Light rail to airport was easy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR77171626">We stayed three nights at the Seattle Westin to test out their beds as we're in the market for a great bed. We stayed at the Peabody Memphis a few months ago and really liked those beds and thought we'd compare. It probably was just the bed in our room (1862) but the middle was considerably softer and made us roll towards the middle. I think we'll purchase the Peabody mattress. The Westin sheets were very nice, though. Overall, I thought the stay at the Westin was decent. Sounds from the hallway and the street were surprisingly audible in our room. I'd be happy if they had a white noise generator in the room. The view is very nice, We didn't opt for the water view, but it was fun to watch the busy Seattle streets. The layout of the room is good and it's nicely decorated. I think the door to the bathroom should slide open rather than swing. You have to step out of the way because it swings so close to the toilet. The A/C didn't seem to cool the room like I thought it should. I was hot when I had it turned to the lowest temperature of 65 degrees. I agree with most people that inroom internet access ought to be free. The lobby is full of people with laptops. Everybody seems surprised when they hear that it is a paid option. Also, parking is $36 and $39 for self park and valet, respectively. We parked next door in a garage that said Westin parking, but was not affiliated with the hotel for $22. It's just before the hotel on 5th street (one way street) and is a short walk to the hotel. Parking is expensive all over downtown Seattle. One thing to note about the $36 parking fee is that it's for 5-24 hours. So, if you park 6 hours, it's $36 and if you leave and come back, you start all over again. We were pleasantly surprised by a $5 voucher we got for forgoing maid service. We used two of them during happy hour at the bar and got two excellent appetizers with two non alcoholic drinks for a total of $4.50. The clam chowder is very good and the customer service in the lobby was good. Judy, the concierge was very helpful. Overall, if I was staying in downtown Seattle again, I would check out another hotel. The Westin is nice and has a great reputation, but the experience I had was just average.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR77021929">Our reservations were messed up from the moment they e-mailed me.

Got an e-mail from them and everything was in black and white until I checked in.

The rooms are dated (popcorn ceiling?), the carpet in mine was horribly stained and coming apart at the center seam. When I looked behind the night table for an electrical outlet, it was absolutely filthy. There were discarded items from previous guests and what looked like a year's worth of layers of dust, seriously. I'd be extremely upset if I'd paid full price but I got this on Priceline. That being the case, the check-in person made it a point of announcing this outloud to anyone within earshot (I've never had a hotel do this to me before), put me in a room with no view to speak of (unless you count HVAC units as something pleasant to see) on the lowest floor possible. I noticed the staff person next to him treating other customers with a LOT more personal care. The other thing that was disapponting was the fact there is no way to get any food in the hotel between 2 &amp; 5 pm except for overpriced, unhealthy snacks in the gift shop. I had driven 5 hours and expected I'd be able to eat something when I arrived. I would have been better off paying full price at a lower star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR76745643">I preface this review by saying that I am a fan of Westin Hotels generally, and for the most part Westins provide reliably good hotel stays. This recent experience, however, was most disappointing. The Westin Seattle is an older property (by Westin standards) north of Seattle city center, although anywhere in downtown can be reached by a short walk. All of the facilities within the hotel are a bit older, especially the infrastructure parts such as the elevators (more on that in a second). I arrived slightly before 12pm and was informed that all of the rooms were still being cleaned, but I could have a wheelchair-acessible room. I readily agreed and went to the designated room on the third floor. I opened the room and looked out the window to discover, with great dismay, that the entire view outside was of a wall. I figured out that the hotel has a four-story tall wall holding the marquis, and because I was on the third floor, I was facing the other side of the wall. So much for the views of this wonderful city. I was glad I was only staying one night. The next morning, I went out for breakfast at about 8:30am. Apparently that was rush hour for the three elevators, as I (and other guests) waited for about ten minutes with no luck. The one elevator we saw was packed and could hold no more passengers. Frustrated, I took the marked stairway down, which led bizarrely to a dirty outside back area of the hotel, and I stumbled my way down to the first floor. The other reviewers are correct, this is a much older property not worthy of the Westin name. The staff was nice enough and the location was great. However, I'd still recommend that folks stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR76380114">The minute we stepped off the elevator we noticed the chemical like odour.

Rooms are worn out and in dire need of renovation. Carpets stained and tattered, mold and mildew in bathrooms, smoky and musty smelling rooms. Most amenities such as bath robes and slippers are only available upon request. (you will want slippers if walking on the carpets) We viewed a total of three rooms on all different floors and each one was in the same sub-standard condition. My husband and I moved after one night due to the lack of cleanliness and machinery noise right beneath our room. There are so many other 4-star options in Seattle that are better value for the money. We spent the remaining nights of our vacation at the Pan Pacific - great! The one positive is that the management at the Westin recognized these deficiencies and made it easy for us to leave.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR73909208">We had a great experience - the staff was friendly and helpful, the location quite good. When we arrived we were a bit shocked by the $36 parking, so we just asked the attendant whether he could recommend any less expensive options, and he gave us printed instructions on how to get to the alternate parking, which is $22 and attached to the mezzanine level by a skybridge. Then, when we checked in (we'd purchased our room on Priceline for only $105 for a weeknight, so the value was great), there was no lineup. It was after our dinner out and 11:30pm so that probably accounted for the lack of lineup. The service was friendly and when I asked if they had any rooms with a king bed, she said that sadly those were all spoken for, but they did have a "parlor rooom" on the 45th floor with views over the city and harbour. Amazing views. Great stay, Comfortable bed, and the room we were given was twice the size of a regular room. So nice that she thought of it; by 11:30pm it isn't likely that anyone else is going to buy it, so she made us happy!

Let me preface that by saying that my point of reference for upscale hotels in Seattle is the Grand Hyatt. Perhaps my judgement was slightly clouded by the fact that I thought that in several aspects, the Westin simply didn't measure up, and that both hotels are generally in the same price range. The Westin features rather odd, pie shaped rooms around two tall, narrow towers. The rooms themselves were fairly standard Westin--very nice work area, typical Heavenly Bed--can't go wrong there---and nice enough bathroom. The room didn't smell quite as "fresh" as I would have liked, which I think is a product of the carpet. At one time, many rooms in this hotel no doubt featured excellent views. I think as construction has continued around this area, that has been mitigated somewhat. My room--which was facing the "right" direction (ie, toward the water)--had what can charitably be described as an "obstructed view." There is a massive, new construction condo tower that has been built essentially right in front of the Westin, which wrecks the views from a lot of rooms, at least in the North Tower. The other thing I'll mention is that the staff here just didn't distinguish themselves. My colleagues witnessed a rather remarkable incident when a late night reveler literally passed out in the lobby, and several hotel employees stood there and watched--not one of them made any kind of move to either assist or remove the individual. Not good. I contrast that with a previous experience at the Grand Hyatt, where the staff was literally one of the best I've ever encountered. Not only did they come out the woodwork to meet every need, but they were friendly and went out of their way to figure out how they might make your day brighter. I don't expect or receive that in most places, but in Seattle, I knew it was a couple of blocks away from the Westin. The Westin is a fine choice...it isn't like you are unhappy. It's just that there's a better choice in the same neighborhood.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72290387">We stayed at the Seattle Westin on July 22 and 23, 2010.

The bathroom was not particularly clean. There was a strange ventilation- related whistling sound present in the bathroom at all times. One of the phones did not work.

The hotel is a bustle of activity with a nice mix of business and personal travelers. The hotel does a great job of customer service and getting people where they need to be. Even though I was a Priceline customer, I was offered a higher floor room when I requested one. The hotel common areas, while busy, were not loud or boisterous. I found the service at the lobby level lounge to be quick and efficient. My room was on the 26th floor of North Tower (which I recommend if you have a choice). It was extremely quiet and relaxing. The room was comfortable and nicely appointed. The bathroom was not large, but did not feel cramped. I enjoyed my one night stay at the Seattle Westin. A couple words of caution. The hotel is starting to show a little wear and tear; small things like scuff marks on the walls, dings on the wood trim around the doors, tears in the carpeting, etc. These may be small deals or big ones depending on your expectations. Also, the elevators are quite slow, especially if you are waiting for one or on one during peak usage. The Westin is located on the northern edge of downtown Seattle proper. A couple of the surrounding areas can get a little sketchy the later into the night it gets; mainly the area north of the hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR67097892">My husband and I are currently staying at the Westin Seattle. He's on business, I'm tagging along for fun. We've stayed at many Westin's but this one doesn't come close to any of the others. It feels more like an old run down Hilton. Cons to staying here / Ick factors: 1. Upon arriving, the signature Westin fragrance was barely noticeable. What I did smell was car exhaust. (Definitely not a deal breaker, but it was my first impression of the hotel.) 2. We checked in early (husband is a gold member) and they assigned us a room immediately. When we opened the door to the first room (room # was 3534, 3634 or 3734...can't remember), the offensive stench of body odor hit us hard. We went back down to the check-in desk and they assigned us to a different room. 3. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. It takes some maneuvering to get the bathroom door closed so you can get in the shower. Let me state for the record that I'm fit, I have no idea how anyone with a few extra pounds on them could move around in these bathrooms. 4. Yellow stains all over the comforter. DISGUSTING! 5. The mini bar was half empty when we arrived. Not a huge deal since we don't usually purchase anything from it, but we better not see that missing stuff on our bill. 6. Pool was ok, but I did smell like pee pee the rest of the day. 7. There is no room service during the afternoon. Not normally a big deal, but I had just worked out and was starving. This was entirely my fault for not planning properly, but I'm just so turned off by this hotel that I'm including this in my ick list. 8. The bed was ridiculously uncomfortable. We have slept on the Heavenly beds many times and love them. We're even considering purchasing one for ourselves. I'm not sure how old this mattress is, but it's AWFUL. 9. In the lobby bathroom, only one soap dispenser had soap in it. 10. This hotel needs some renovating / updating in a major way. Pro's: 1. The people working here are very nice. 2. Location I'm definitely particular when it comes to staying in hotels and am usually impressed with the Westin. This one stay won't turn me off of Westin's but I certainly won't stay here again.

There were a few cons. First, the hotel really nickel and dimes you by charging $39/day for valet parking/$22 per day for reg parking (a charge you don't find out about till you get there) and I was even charged for 2 calls I made to room service during my stay. I mean, I can see charging for phone calls, but calls within the hotel?? give me a break! I also had to call the hotel a couple of times; once on questions about getting food after the restaurant was closed, another about a question regarding my receipt.. Both times I found the help on the other end of the line to be rather cold and apathetic. Not something that I would expect from a 4 star hotel. Finally, the elevators in this building are creepy! It seemed like everyone in the elevators with me was kind of nervous. they just seem really old, really dirty, and like they haven't been serviced in a long, long time. the ride up and down is really bumpy. it just doesn't feel right. I mean, it's probably okay in all honesty. But again, $160+ per night for a room and they still have crappy old elevators from the 1970's? not to mention, they are totally worn down and dirty? it was odd. Okay one last thing, they do have really nice workout facilities but if you are planning on working out., try to stay in the same tower as the gym. otherwise, you have to go down, across a sky bridge and then up to the 5th floor of the other tower.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR65529050">At best the staff at Westin Seattle is indifferent: bureaucrats. The concierge acts like he pays for the maps; the front desk insisted that we pay for TWO connections to their outrageously priced (and lousy) internet service because there are two of us in the room. This being the second Westin I've stayed in during the past two weeks, I am getting the impression that management has decided to cut corners. Penny wise, pound foolish, once you're in this price category, for these little details (cheesy shampoo, tight-fisted clerks) are what distinguishes one upscale hotel from the next. This is a Holiday Inn about to happen.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR65230095">After three weeks, I checked my credit card and there had been a $48.00 made. For what I have no idea. When I checked out...I paid a 68.00 room charge. I trying to figure out what happened but of course no one is in the office.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR64849610">Had a great stay in the Westin. My mother and I shared a room while in town for my brother's wedding. We got an amazing deal through Priceline (put in "downtown" and "four stars"). The hotel was wonderful about our special requests (two beds, high floor), even though we had come in through Priceline. The staff was very friendly and quick to respond when needed. My mother is very sensitive to her environment and had no complaints about the air quality, linens or noise. I found the beds really, really comfortable, with nice linens and lots of pillows. Everything was clean and fresh without have any weird perfume-y air fresheners. The round tower structure makes the rooms wedge-shaped, with huge windows. we had a nice view of city buildings and the water from the 32nd floor in the south tower. I used the pool and whirlpool twice (5th floor, North Tower, with a cool glass roof), and found everything clean and well cared for. When I went early in the morning, I had the pool practically to myself. The outdoor deck area looked really nice, too, but it wasn't quite warm enough to do any sunbathing. There is no room in the minibar to put your own items, but the staff brought in an extra fridge on request. The location was perfect, just minutes walking to Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and downtown shopping, including the great Nordstroms. It was about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport. I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR64779948">The Westin in downtown Seattle is a perfect location for any kind of visit. It's steps from Pike Place and a 2.50 ride on the rail from the airport. Shopping is all around you- from a mall to downtown to Pike's. It's comfy, loved the fitness center! It has a great view and a Starbucks is across the street. Okay, it's Seattle- there are StarBucks everywhere! The very first one is a few blocks away. Shop ahead for a deal. Advance rates were the best.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR64776505">This hotel was just awful. First of all we booked the hotel for one night with two adults and two children. When we checked in we went up to our room and had one king size bed. So my husband went down to switch to two beds. He came back and neither one of the keys would work. So we waited another 15 minutes for a new key. The manager came up with two keys. No apology. So we get in our room and change and go out for dinner. We come back and niether key will work again. Again we wait for another manager and again no apology. The beds are really comfortable. So we get up in the morning and we did the race for the cure. We come back with just 30 minutes to change, shower and be on our way to the airport and again not one of our 4 keys work. So once again a new manager arrives 15 minutes later with two more keys and no apology. We are Hilton Diamond members and I think we will be staying with Hiltons.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR64249759">Easy check-in/out. Courteous front dask and Coldwater restaurant staff. Room amenities above average, dual shower heads height NOTan issue, my height is 6' tall. Location very condusive to exploring most city sectors on foot. Four available elevators Never encountered a wait issue even with on-going conferences. Utilized ajoining parking garage at $126.00 weekly with skybridge connection to North tower. On street parking very expensive bordering on excessive and quit a deterrant to recurring visit! Room attendants tasks appeared transparent during seven day stay. On our floor there was the occasional barking of a dog which we acclimated to eventually. Rating of stay 9 of 10. P.S. Gardeners Do try to visit KUBOTA Gardens.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR63896326">Pros - Easy to find off I-5 with large parking garage and easy valet. 1 block from monorail at West Lake Centers. Right in shopping area- easy walking distance to Pike Place Market. Friendly staff at check in. Our room was ready and waiting. Elevators were swift and only crowded once when we tried to leave. Staff were friendly at check out - even with a problem with our bill. (mini bar got "bumped") Rooms were nice. Comfy beds and clean feeling. Nice tub/shower and toiletries. Great view of Space Needle &amp; Lake Union. Cons- $39 parking. Ouch! Elevator was pretty full at one point and we had to wait about fifteen minutes for one to open up. Mini bar is sensored and even the slightest bump will rack up your bill. Be careful!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR62635836">I stayed here last weekend just for the night. Really, the decor is not that great for a Westin...felt more like a run down Holiday Inn. I've stayed in really nice Westin's and this one was not up to par. It just felt old, they need to remodel. The noise level also was pretty bad. All I could hear all night was the sound of other guests slamming their doors. The only plus for me is that it was 2 minutes walking distance from Norstroms.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR62625011">Stayed here, with a friend, for a 5 night business trip. We were both very pleased with the room and the service. The front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff was very responsive and helpful. I had a free refrigerator (you have to request it). They are trying to be "green" so they give you a $5 coupon for the cafe if you decline housekeeping. We decided that we did not want to waste water having them wash sheets and towels everyday, we don't do that at home, so this was a good deal. The pool and jacuzzi are nice. Excellent location in the downtown area. 19th floor was quiet, no street noise. Felt very safe. The room was nice, not huge, but certainly good enough for the amount of time that we spent there. I would definitely return to the Westin. Free wifi in the lobby, although you can pay for the internet access in the room. Business center has free boarding pass access, otherwise you pay for the internet. Bring a laptop and sit in the lobby. You can people-watch and surf at the same time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR62317194">This hotel is in an excellent location, and the service is excellent. Everyone in the lobby is cheerful and very helpful. The furniture was dated, and the carpet was stained and stiff in places. Rooms seriouly need an overhaul.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR61862389">My room was relatively spacious (for downtown Seattle) with a partial view of Lake Union. It seemed a bit dated in some ways even though it had been remodeled at some point during the hotel's history. The room seemed pretty clean on the surface. The comfy bed was definitely the best part of the room. But the unfortunate problem was ... bed bugs. I have always been paranoid about them even though I'd never encountered them myself. I knew what they looked like and how to find signs of them. I didn't have any bites, but just finding a dead one and later, one live one, convinced me of their presence in the room. I also found a small "nest" or whatever on the bedskirt - wouldn't the housekeeper have seen this? I called the front desk, and they had the bellman bring me a key to a new room in the other tower within about 30-40 minutes. I received a letter under the door the next day explaining how serious they take bed bugs, how they would quarantine the room, and refunded my first night. Coincidentally I had to come back to the hotel a few days later (was staying in a different hotel in town for personal vacation time) to look for some books I left behind in that room's armoire, and the room was indeed taped off and the bed dismantled. So I feel that the Westin Seattle management handled this fairly well... but I also think they need to improve their housekeeping procedures to prevent this ever increasing issue.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR61823431">my room was large, very clean. comfortable bed and great location. can't ask for much more. staff was friendly.

This place was fantastic! It was close to all the major sites in Seattle and very close to the light transit which took you to SeaTac Airport for only $2.50 one way. Awesome value! The room was spacious and on the 20th floor. We had the view of the seattle tower from our room. The room was just heavenly as the information pack suggested. Every thing you could ask for was in this room. They did not have free internet access in the room, however there is complimentary internet in the lobby, which was great because you can watch the guest come in and our and you can also shop and buy a drink. Since we did book this hotel as a secret hotel the price was extremely reasonable. The bed was very comfortable and we had a king bed which was very roomy. The bathroom had twin showers which were awesome. The hotel does recommend that you only use one head for water conservation however, it was lovely to indulge once in a while. There are wonderful restaurants all around and the market were wonderful for food and little souvenirs to take home. The restaurant food in the hotel is quite expensive while outside you can get some delicious food and experience the Seattle nightlife. The staff were superfriendly and provided us with information and exchange the coffee machine promptly. Despite such a huge hotel it had the comfort of being the only one that matter and the only one there.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR61146422">We stayed at the Westin recently for a couple of nights, having booked the room for less than half the stock rate on hotwire. For the money the hotel was solid...the bed was comfortable and the room a decent size. The hotel is older and large, we typically stay in more modern or "boutique" style smaller properties so it was a little out of the norm for us. For the money though it was fine. Great location and half price parking if you park on your own at the garage next door...which others have mentioned is even connected by a second story covered skybridge. People mention the low showers and they are low, but certainly not the worst I've seen..being 6'5" I notice these things, they are roomy and adjustable to a certain extent, nice when both heads are used. Is this my favourite seattle hotel, no...but if you can get a good price then its nice and a good value. Just don't pay full pop...if you're going to spend that much there are far nicer options. I'd rate it more of a 3 1/2 star than a four and it's showing its age a little is all.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR60875878">I visited Seattle with two friends and stayed at the westin hearing good things about it. We enjoyed our stay the beds were extremely comfortable and most of the service was great. The only issue we had we the concierge, it seemed that most of the time they were unaware of the area they were able to tell us how to get to pikes but other than that they were pretty useless. Overall we definately enjoyed our stay and would stay again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR59787092">Just stayed at this hotel and read all of the reviews on this site prior to our stay. This isn't the greatest hotel or the worst. I've stayed in other Westin's recently including near DFW airport and this just isn't as new or modern. On the other hand it wasn't falling apart either. Lots of goods tips from other reviewers including the cheaper ($18 per day) parking on the north side of the hotel along 5th Ave connected by the 2nd floor skybridge. Pulled into the drive-thru area on arrival and they allowed us to leave the car there for 15 minutes while we checked in. That was plenty of time as there was no line at the counter. At other times during our stay I noticed short lines at checkin - luck of the draw like any hotel. Check-in was friendly with certainly no hint of an anti-Priceline bias as one reviewer claimed. We were given our choice of towers so we went with the north and asked for a view if possible. We ended up on the 30th floor and did in fact have a good view of the Sound. The room was fine. We went with the King and put the kids on the pull-out sofa. Thanks to another reviewer for that suggestion. We used the pool a couple of times with the kids. The top row of tiles needs a good scrub but it seemed fine otherwise. I couldn't bring myself to use the big hot tub. There was a healthy dose of foam on top and it looked like it needed a good dose of something. Top Pot Donuts on 5th Ave just north past the parking garage is a great place for good coffee and truly excellent donuts. We thought the location was good and excellent for walking around Seattle. We all enjoyed the Olympic Sculpture Park and waterfront.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR59386334">Booked through Priceline, paid less than half the best posted rate at the moment. We ended up with a room on the 44th floor, looking out over the city - fantastic and nice and quiet. The bed was amazing, something they call the "Westin Heavenly Bed." I would stay in the hotel again just because of the bed. The place is a bit older, had a tiny uncomfortable old iron bathtub, but no big deal. A 2 minute walk to Nordstrom's, 5 minutes to Macy's. 10-15 minutes to Pike Place Market. Service was excellent. My only complaint would be the usual complaints of 4*s - they gouge you on parking ($36 per day for valet) or $33 for self park. But if you are a bit organized, there is cheaper parking within a block nearby - research it a bit before you go. They also gouge on room service, and charge ridiculous fees for phone and internet. But if you pay so little via Priceline, it is no big deal.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58691873">I was forced to stay here for a work conference and I would never recommend or return to this Westin again. There are so many other nice hotels in Seattle and this is not one of them. The carpets are gross; I was afraid to even walk on them even while wearing socks. Bathroom looked dirty when I checked in, stuff was in the sink and just looked unclean. The towels were old and thinning. The shower is fit for a very short person...not sure how any adults over 5'5" are supposed to maneuver properly in there. The glasses in my room were disgusting, a sign that the rest of the place probably was not properly cleaned, either. If they don't even leave clean glasses, then they certainly are too lazy to properly clean other parts of the room. In addition, the TV is a piece of junk...analog only stations...what hotel doesn't offer HDTV at this price point? Wireless charge of $10/day is ridiculous, too. Icing on the cake here is that the room has been HEAVILY sprayed with some sort of perfume or air freshener which has me very concerned about the smell they are trying to mask. Overall, I am clearly not impressed and cannot wait to leave in a few days. I hope my company is getting a great rate here b/c my discount at the Four Seasons is $160/night and that is TRULY a 4+ star hotel that knows good service. This place is a dump.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58649262">My family and I stayed at this hotel twice this month. We were able to get good rates via Priceline and, thus, were summarily sent to a lower floor in the South Tower. I was told that there were no upper level rooms. I knew this was a lie but family was too tired for me to push issue at 10pm traveling from east coast. The room (1159) had a significant mold problem. Those with allergies and/or asthma will be impacted. After the first night, we were moved to a higher floor in the North Tower. This tower, I was told, was more recently renovated. I appreciated the hotel moving and putting us in same tower on second stay but this is a problem they need to address or they will drop even lower in ratings for Seattle. Their fix of running ozone air cleaner will not work. The room works for a family of four only if you stay in a king room, use the pullout couch (which they will need to make up for you) and get a roll-away brought into the room. It is tight but workable. Parking is a nightmare in this city. I tried everything to spend less than $30 per day and was unsuccessful.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR58554475">We stayed in a Grand View room for one night before heading the Olympics. Reading some of the other reviews, maybe your experience depends on what room you're in. We splurged on a Grand View room that was part of their romance package. As you'll see from the pictures, the view was stunning. Our room was nicely appointed and was clean. Included in the package was Chateau Ste Michelle sparkling wine and room service for breakfast. We've stayed in many Westins and would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58458763">The Westin Seattle tarnishes the Westin brand and reputation. This hotel is in dire need of a complete remodel. It lacks character in the rooms and halls and feels like a high rise college dorm that was built in the 70's. The carpet, bathroom, and baseboards in my room showed considerable wear and tear. The ventilation system needs to be cleaned. When I turned it on, the room had a stale odor and I woke up with a horrible headache. As a Starwood Gold member, I expected a nicer room. Instead of the king I reserved I was given two double beds in a room that was not on an SPG member floor. Service at the front desk was indifferent. I felt that the staff was not friendly and did not appreciate guests. The service in the restaurant (Coldwater Bar and Grill) was just awful. The food was even worse. The server rushed me even though the restaurant was empty at 7 pm. He gave me my check while I was only halfway through my entree and never checked in with me about my meal. Given this experience, I guess other guests were clued in not to eat there. The lobby bar experience was so so. The area was cold with an air conditioner blasting even though it was 45 degrees and raining outside. The sofas and chairs were very worn with springs that gave way. The by the glass wine list was very limited - a disappointment given that there are so many wonderful wineries near Seattle. Needless to say, I will not stay at the Westin Seattle again and have canceled the reservation I made for my next trip to Seattle. I will stay at another Starwood Seattle property because of my loyalty to the brand.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58386162">This hotel is past its prime and is improperly maintained. Service from cleaning staff is poor. Heavenly shower useless gimick as it is set so low on the wall if you are over 5'6" you have to duck to get your head under it. Ventilation is not cleaned hence every time it turns on room reeks like a gym locker, and rooms have constant unpleasant odour as a result. We asked to be moved once as a result but discovered it is through various rooms. We booked via discount site and was not worth the money even then. They charge for parking charge for internet and onsite restaurant and cafe keep very limited hours.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR58001549">Stayed March 5-7, 2010, paid $75 a night through Priceline. Pros - I really liked the downtown location, central to everything - great food and lots of shopping nearby. Front desk and concierge were friendly and polite. I was given the choice of a king or two doubles when we checked in, and chose the king which was on a lower floor, in hindsight I'd choose the two doubles on the higher floor as we stayed on the 12th floor and only had a view of the monorail and surrounding buildings. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the furnishings were decent and the bathroom was clean. The gym was also well equipped, clean and had personal T.V's for the cardio machines with clean headsets. Cons - You could hear every little noise from the hallway, the sound didn't seem to be muffled at all. I also feel like free Internet access should be standard in this day and age, paying an extra $16 per day for WiFi feels like a money grab. Hotel parking is really expensive; however parking in the underground lot next door (which is connected by the overpass walkway) is only $18 for 24 hours. Overall, we saved a lot by booking through Priceline, so I thought it was good value for the money - however I don't think it's worth the rack rate. We'd return if we got another deal as the location is great.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR57921978">Overall: The hotel is very nice, if a bit dated. It could most definitely do with a refurbishment as I would say this hasnâ€™t been done in quite some time. Itâ€™s partly wear and tear but also fairly old decor, furnishing, fittings in the bathrooms, wallpaper etc. However it was very clean, presentable and we were happy with our stay there. Location: The Westin is centrally located in 5th Avenue, within walking distance of the Pike St Markets and the CBD, Puget Sound etc, and short monorail ride to the Space Needle. It was a good location to get pretty much wherever you wanted without too much hassle. Rooms: Good, quite spacious and fabulously comfortable beds. They had a large, flat screen TV, a writing desk and 2 armchairs. The bathroom was quite good although the shower was over the bath and my preference is for a separate shower recess â€“ however the water was nice and hot and it had good pressure, and everything was clean. Restaurants: There is a small cafe of sorts on the ground floor which served breakfast, but it was poorly run, too small for a hotel of that size and the service could have been much better. The food was quite OK without being outstanding. The restaurant, the Cold Water Grill, was excellent. The food was great, it was well run, and the staff were fabulous. Again itâ€™s a little small for a large hotel but that didnâ€™t really matter as there were many restaurants in nearby areas to patronise. Check in/checkout process: We arrived at the Westin very late on a Tuesday night. Out flight got in around 11pm and by the time we got through customs and collected our luggage and got to the hotel, it was close on midnight. There had been a bit of a mix-up with the dates of check in and out, but that was my fault and the reception desk staff could not have been more gracious or helpful. We told her we had just arrived from Australia after a 16 hour flight and she must have felt sorry for us because she upgraded our room and put us on the 40th floor â€“ when we got into the lift we discovered it was the very top floor! If there was a penthouse suite on the top floor that wasnâ€™t it! But the room was spacious, clean, comfortable and had a great view of Puget Sound â€“ and we were very grateful for the upgrade. All the rest of the staff, from the Concierge to the bellboys to the restaurant staff, were great and we have no complaints at all.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR57618960">We do priceline most the time and quite often get placed at the Westin and are happy with it.

Parking- $72 for 2 days! There are several downtown hotels that have cheaper or free parking. 'Mini Bar'- $5 for a candybar, 7.25 for a budweiser(hahaha). The management should put the refrigerators back in! They obviously had them once, but now you can check in your leftovers, tag them and staff will take them down to some cooler somewhere, yeah right. $179 for a standard room, with double beds even. Worst night of sleep I've had at a hotel in the US. Grouchy 'express service' staff. The biggest insult: $16 for 24 hours worth of internet. Uh, where's the wi-fi folks? In a happening city like Seattle I certainly expect free wi-fi (like all the hotels in Portland... and others we've stayed at in Seattle) The only reason we went there in the first place was because my daughter had a dance competition there. I added one star because they didn't have a bible in the room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56710724">I booked my room at the Seattle Westin after having a great experience at the Portland Westin. The two hotels really can't be compared. The Westin Seattle is an over-priced hotel with few amenities. My room, on the 17th floor was adequate. The bathroom was TINY (two people wouldn't fit in there) with a small tub/shower combo. The "heavenly" showerhead had no water pressure, and I had to sqaut down to get my head wet because the shower head was placed so low. The couch in the room had suspicious stains on it, as did the curtains. The walls were scuffed up too. The wall colors were sea-foam green and just seemed tired and worn out. Room service is out-of-control. A breakfast of just oatmeal would have cost me over $14. The small cafe was adequate, but was limited on choice there too. Parking at the Westin is $36/day, which is ridiculous, and they don't offer free wi-fi. Be wary of conferences and events taking place in the ballrooms. A fraternity was holding a winter ball, and their behavior in the lobby was outrageous-- drunkeness, making out, one girl's dress was even rolled up to her waist. I don't think I will stay at the Westin Seattle again, it just didn't meet my expecations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR56432158">This has to one of the best places I've stayed recently. Easy check in and out. Had a room with a great view on the next to the top floor. A very comfortable bed, nice quiet climate control, quality bathroom amenities, and a convenient electrical outlet right next to the bed. (I use a CPAP machine, and some places you have to practically stand on your head to get to an outlet.) Comfortable work table and good lighting in the whole room. All this at at a great Priceline rate. Priceline is sometimes kind of a crapshoot, (2 days later the Hyatt in Irvine, CA gave me - I'm not kidding- a room with NO BED) but this one was great! My first stay in Seattle, and I'd recommend the Westin highly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR56419967">THis hotel was very nice. The room we had was facing the needle. The soft sheets and large king bed was great. We had connecting rooms with the kids and friends down the hallway. The connecting room was on a curve of the hotel so the doorway had its own lil nook. The bar downstairs was great to hang out. The hotel clerks weren't very good at directions and the concierge was closed. Great location for walking Pike's Market and the new tram was nearby to get you to the Needle if you wanted. Drivers beware: Parking is VERY expensive...running from 25-40 a night extra for your car to spend the night with you at any of the area hotels. We paid it and walked every where as it is very difficult to even find parking. Most things you will need are within a 7 block walk, but bring a small umbrella and a light jacket.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR56326483">The experience my partner and I had at The Westin was above and beyond horrible! I booked a night for Valentine's day weekend via Hotwire for a great price hoping to have a fun and romantic time in Seattle downtown. However, upon arriving at front desk I was shocked when the guest rep. stated we were assigned TWO FULL size BEDS!!! Are you kidding?! I was aware of the fact that by booking through hotwire you are not guaranteed a king size bed or a double..However, I called a few days before our check in date to request for a king size bed. Also keep in mind that I booked this a little over a month prior to our check in date. On the day of check in about an hour prior to arriving at the Westin, I called again to check what kind of room we were going to be in. Rep clearly assured me that we were assigned ONE KING SIZE bed. So here's what really upset me: The simple fact that I was told one thing AN HOUR prior to arrival and then another when we got there. I totally understand that yes you are not guaranteed anything if booked using a third party website..However, aren't these employees trained well enough to know what they are talking about?!? When we finally got to our room I decided to call and requested to speak with a manager. First I went through a couple people claiming they did not know who their manager was or they didn't have one because they were in the reservations dept (HA, right). I finally spoke to James- one of the managers at the Westin who was very patient w/ me and nice about the whole situation. I definitely expressed my frustration and he explained some things I was not aware of as far as policies and what to expect from booking via websites (e.g. Hotwire, Expedia, etc.) I felt a little bit better after speaking with him- he even sent a bottle of wine later on that night for us. The wine was another issue. (what we thought would take 10 minutes after getting off the phone with him took an hour so we decided to call back and had it delivered at a later time since we had to be elsewhere.) We appreciated the wine..however, I just felt that was the wrong hotel to be in after waiting an hour for it. There was a mini-fridge w/ all kinds of beverages including alcohol in our room. I do not recall seeing a sign anywhere saying there was a sensor nor did the lady who checked us in warned us that my card would be charged if you lift any of the drinks. My partner decided to remove all the beer cans (about $8/ea) so we can store the wine in there instead. There were several cans that were removed and of course WE WERE NOT AWARE we would be charged until I checked my credit card statement today. SO I call today, front desk rep tells me I have to call back tomorrow during business hours and speak with "Accounting." I am already dreading to make this call. I've invested too much time and energy with these people. The only good thing I can say about this place is the location. Yes it's near everything, but there are so many other hotels that can provide BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE, better staff in the area that you should consider. We stayed at the GRAND HYATT in downtown the following evening and we definitely noticed the HUGE difference once arriving there..They had the friendliest staff, (rep who checked us in made us aware of the mini fridge sensor) nicer loby, beautiful room, view, location, BETTER SERVICE!!! so don't waste your time at the WESTIN, i definitely regret my decision because my expectations were not met at all. WESTIN is a 4 start hotel and so is THE GRAND HYATT, so shouldn't the customer service level be the same?? If not, even higher? THE GRAND HYATT definitely stood out w/ us. The WESTIN- not so much. I would never recommend this place, the faculty don't seem to care- it takes 10 rings before someone can pick up your call, guest reps are rude esp. over the phone, It takes an hour to deliver a bottle of wine, lots of noises from the upper level *not sure if it was maintance or what- If you don't want to waste your time explaining errors to management, calling them over and over, writing reviews such as this, don't stay there! BTW this is the first hotel review I've ever written. You can probably tell how bad it was considering I took the time to write this for all of you! Good Luck and enjoy your stay!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR55487606">We had friends coming into Seattle for the weekend and we ended up paying full price for our one night stay. The location is wonderful!!! The views are wonderful!!! The staff seemed courteous enough. The bed was comfortable, a little soft for our taste. The elevators were scary, not a smooth ride at all and once an alarm/ buzzer went off that worried us all in it at the time. We all had a chuckle at the economy style toilet paper, we use toilet paper as a scaling tool, sometimes it is the little things. The bathrooms are on the small side due to the shape of the rooms. We had a hard time using the clothing drawers because of where they were next to the bed, so they hit the side of the bed, a little inconvenient. We left the laptops at home also seeing as you had to pay for the WiFi. Self parking was $36/for hotel guests, I was a bit shocked that there was no free parking. Would we stay there again, yes, but we would book the room on a discount site like our friends did.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR54157321">Comfortable rooms with Very Nice Views of Seattle space needle. Heavenly bed was good, but could use newer bedding. The rooms were a bit small, but comfortable. The Heavenly Shower was Great! 2 Thumbs up for the Double Shower heads. The bathroom was a bit small, felt tight. You had to move out of the way to open the door. Nice Central Location. Pacific Place, Pike Market, are all nearby. An Easy monorail ride to the Space Needle as well. Got a great deal from hotwire at $89. Plus got an upgrade to a Space Needle View Room. A really great deal.

View was of construction..... Was clean and room was average. Would recommend but not as a five star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR51669434">This hotel has some good points and some bad points: Good: 1. Location. It is right across the street from 2 shopping centres, the monorail, and only 3 blocks walk to pike place market. That alone is worth it. 2. The view!! We were on the 21st floor, and the view even from there is outstanding! Perfect view of the space needle, some water and some neighbourhoods to the north. This was a big, big plus in my opinion. 3. The beds. The heavenly beds are just that -heavenly! Had perfect sleeps both nights. The bad: 1. The service isn't bad, just not really there. Nobody said hi to me in the 2 days I was there, other than the front desk of course. I don't like to pick on that, but even a friendly 'hello, how are you today?' and a smile would be nice. No one is grumpy by any means, but they don't exactly go out of their way to make you feel at home either. Maybe it was just my experience. 2. The carpets/floors desperately need to be upgraded. It was kind of dirty and not very nice. 3. parking is ridiculous at $36/day. TIP: DO NOT park in their parking lot. There is a parking lot a block away on 5th ave off lenora that is half the price. It says westin on the building but is not owned by westin anymore. It's only $18. Please heed this advice. 4. No free internet anywhere. You have to pay for it in your hotel room (!), and have to pay for it downstairs on the main floor! Not cool. Overall it's a nice hotel. The TV isn't HD, for me I like to watch sports, for someone else it might not matter. The bathrooms were very nice as well, other than the tub looked like it needed to be re-caulked. It's very quiet, I never heard a peep in the entire 2 days we were there. I would recommend this hotel, but try to get a deal via price line or somewhere. We got ours off hotwire.com, paid somewhere around $96 USD. I think if they upgrade the carpets, have free internet and most of all, improve their service a bit they'll be top notch.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR51466637">This hotel is in a fabulous location, esp if you're into shopping.

Knowing that hotel rooms at decent properties in Seattle are quite expensive I chose to do a name your own price selection through Priceline. The hotel which won my bid was the Westin in downtown Seattle. I was initially pleased. Iâ€™ve stayed at Westins in different parts of the U.S. before. They are generally quality locations and typically cater to business and convention travelers. This seems apparent with regard to the fees they charge for things that other hotels include as part of your room stay. Services like Wi-Fi and parking are not included at the Westin, but are at other brands of hotels. That is just a limited example, but I think illustrates my point. Upon arriving we found the front desk staff friendly in that typical Westin way, young bucks just out of college or hospitality school who are dressing way beyond their pay grade and paid to be friendly and ingratiating. It is much better than being sneered at by the night desk clerk at a budget motel, but it still has a corporate insincerity to it that is hard to disguise. Our room was reasonably nice, on an upper floor of the building. The view was of downtown Seattle and not the bay, but it was still very pleasant. I was a little confused as to why my wife and I were given a room with double beds, but I associate that with booking through Priceline. Unfortunately, for a 4+ star property, the beds and room dÃ©cor were not nearly up to standard. The bed linens were the typical nice linens you see at all Westins, however the mattresses themselves were very uncomfortable and felt worn out. The furnishings in the room looked well worn; corners of end tables and desks were scratched up and marred from guest use and abuse. There was a patch hole in the carpet right at the foot of a bed in a high traffic area. The work desk was generous and the view from it was very nice, but the chair accompanying the desk was beyond worn out and leaned to one side. The side chairs in the room looked very work, and one of them was heavily stained. The bathroom was very clean and was probably the nicest part of the room. It was as if the bathroom had been remodeled recently, but the rest of the room had not been given any attention in many years. The provided soaps and toiletries were top notch as usual. It was especially nice to have a flip cap on the shampoo and conditioner. Nothing is more annoying than hotel sized soaps that you have to unscrew with wet hands in the shower. The most annoying part of this stay, was having to pay to park. I had to pay $36 to park for one overnight stay. Not acceptable. The Westin Seattle is a nice hotel to stay in, certainly not a dump by any means, but nickel and diming for services others provide as part of the room rental is not acceptable in this day in age. Rooms may need some refreshing and maintenance and for a premium price facilities should be kept at a very high maintenance standard.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR50086894">The Westin is perfectly located in downtown Seattle, with so many attractions a short 5-10 minute walk away! Shopping, shopping, shopping! Nordstrom's, Macy's, Tiffany's, the list goes on! All just a block or two away from the hotel lobby! Pike Place Market is a 10 minute walk.And the monorail to Seattle City Center and the Space Needle is a block away. Parking is expensive ($36/day self-park &amp; $39/day valet)... but with everything so close by foot... who needs a rental car?!?! We were in a lovely room on the 38th floor of the north tower... with a wonderful view of the harbor and ferry terminal, beyond the entrance to the market. Being so high up, I did need to use ear plugs on two of the nights, as the building would creak a bit with heavier winds. Wireless internet was available free in the lobby, but in the room prices were too expensive. $10/day. If Hampton Inn can provide free internet, why is Westin nickel and diming on a service that modern customers have come to expect. Room service was good... dinner in the restaurant was hit or miss (one of the best entrees of our trip, and one of the worst). The week day staff was fantastic... pleasant, accommodating, going the extra step to ensure we felt taken care of, and not just another face in the crowd. Especially John, at the valet service.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR49218119">It is an older hotel that needs updating.

As such, the guest may hear noises as the building moves during windstorms. This is appropriate. Do not worry. If the guest is disturbed, ear plugs are available at guest services." LOL!! The building does indeed creak and groan with regularity. And, because of the circular design, no suite is more than 10 feet from the elevators, which whoosh and whirr noisily all night long. All in all, a very spooky place to stay Hallo'ween Eve.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR47965522">We enjoyed our three-day stay here immensely. Within walking distance, you can find a large drugstore, good restaurants, a downtown shopping mall, the monorail to the Space Needle and it's within a doable walking distance to Pike Place Market. Their on-premises 5th Street Cafe had excellent food. Starbucks coffee shops close by and Starbucks coffee for your in-room coffee maker. The staff was courteous and friendly.

We were initially a bit hesitant due to some TA reviews stating the hotel was showing some wear and tear. Upon arriving we didn't notice anything like that at all. Our room was on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor and was clean, comfortable and quiet with two double beds. The only quibble with our room was the placement of the television which was at an uncomfortable angle to view when lying in bed. Service from the hotel staff was courteous and professional, including the front desk personnel and concierge. Our room was promptly cleaned everyday although we never saw the cleaning staff. One morning we left for breakfast and returned a bit over an hour later to find our room already cleaned and serviced. Location is perfect for downtown, close to the Westlake Mall, Pacific Place, downtown stores, the monorail, Pike Market and convenient to Qwest Field. The underground bus line, free in the downtown core is a great way to get to the stadium. There are many good restaurants in the immediate area and we walked to every one during our visit; Serious Pie, Shiro's, Lowell's and Elliott's Oyster House. We enjoyed our stay at the Westin and would not hesitate to book a room there for our next visit to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR46194552">No housekeeping service until after 5pm and then only if requested.

Everyone at front desk was also very rude.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR46023593">Like most reviews, the Westin is conveniently located to Pike's Place, shopping, Monorail, dining, etc. It's close to a Bartell's - basically a CVS or Walgreens. The hotel is not bad. Hosts lots of conventions. The beds are excellent. The hallways can get noisy. Try not to get a room by the elevator. The North Tower rooms are better - equipped with the Westin Workout. The South Tower is good too. Concierege is very helpful and knowledgeable. i did not dine or order room service, so i have no idea what the food tastes like. But i did see quite a bit of people eating at the restaurants. the room as Starbucks coffee, so i made my own in the mornings. I definitely would not pay more than $175 a night for this hotel... regardless of time of year. If you need to print out your airline boarding pass, the business center will do it for free. That's a plus.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR45677745">We arrived at the Westin in time for checkin......from the instant we got there, we were told they only had a certain kind of rooms available for people who made their reservations using Priceline (which means the least desirable). Since most of us use a discount travel site nowadays, (especially with this ecomony) it seems they should be more welcoming to people who actually CHOSE this hotel to stay in. The receptionist was VERY snobby and refused to entertain any requests from us. That treatment continued thruout our 3 day stay. The room itself was doable and comfortable, but the way the staff treated us was unacceptable. The front desk offered to help us with our luggage, but when we refused that, they could no longer be bothered by us. We were basically on our own in a city we knew nothing about and had never visited. The morning restaurant downstairs was nice, but a bit pricey......opened very early for coffee and breakfast foods.......always busy......more of a cafeteria style........but coffee was good and plentiful. They offer Starbucks coffee inroom, but cups are small and only enough for 1 day and 1 cup each. If we ever return to Seattle, we will not be staying at the Westin, and can't advise u to, either.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR45581669">Stayed for 5 nights from Sept 19 and enjoyed our visit.

The elevators were always FAST, even with a conference happening during or stay.

When we arrived at the Westin Hotel we found out they had given our room away, probably to someone who was willing to pay a lot due to Bumbershoot. They had no excuse, but tried to convince us that there was an even better hotel nearby that they would accommodate us at free of charge. We didn't know what to say so we just went along with it, but now I wish I had fought back. This other Hotel was very dark, had lots of loud music, and full of teenagers and/or college students. The room wasn't much better and after a good cry we decided to go back home. I never did have my wedding night. A year later around our first anniversary I felt reminded of this event and wrote The Westin an email encouraging them to be more sensitive to their guests, because you never know the impact a guest's stay can have. Surprisingly they wrote back, confirmed that my story was true, and to my amazement offered us a one night's stay in one of their deluxe suites. Although this couldn't make up for the importance of our actual wedding day I thought it was a sweet gesture and appreciated their apology, so we accepted. Some time went by, and we never received the certificate we were told would arrive in the mail. When I tried to contact them to see what was going on they never responded. In my opinion it doesnâ€™t matter how fancy a place looks or how impressive the food is. What matters is how you are treated as a guest, paying customer, but most importantly a person. To say the least, I would never encourage anyone to visit this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR44321274">After some coments of some people.

However, the hotel itself needs a number of improvements to live up to its 4-star rating. We booked this hotel on Priceline for about $145. They seemed intent on putting us into a handicap-accessible room on the 6th floor, which is fine but there's no where to put sundries in the bathroom (which I am pretty sure irritates disabled people as much as it does able-bodied people). The first room that they put us in did not have a clean bathroom. There was literally urine and toilet paper in the toilet and the floor and shower area was visibly dirty with grime and hair. We called and asked for them to clean it or move us, so they moved us next door, to another handicapped room. We took them up on it. In both rooms, there was a wall of windows that looked out on to an exterior wall of some sort. So, we weren't able to enjoy the view because it was entirely obstructed. We ate in a restaurant in the lounge and the staff was fantastic. The prices were typical for a downtown area and the food was good. We had our 1 year old child with us and they brought out ice cream and crackers for her and generally spoiled her, so we were pleased with that. Between the hotel charge, parking (which was substantial-- I think it was $18 for the off-site, non-valet parking), internet (around $10) and dining, we spent around $250 at the hotel. Considering the substandard accomodation, I'm not sure it was quite worth it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR40929294">We stayed in the North Tower of the Westin on the 46th floor, just one level below Penthouse.

With Starbucks coffee in-room and their to-go paper cups, made going out with a coffee in hand just like home. I'd have to say very thoughtful of them! Their heavenly beds were comfy, but nothing special. There is free Wifi in the lobby, and if you don't have your own laptop. They have a room with free computers to use, but it may be a wait now and then. The location was awesome though. 10 minute walk to Pike Place, 5 minutes to the central square where Sephora, Macy, Nordstrom, A&amp;F is. We arrived on a Sunday and there was free street parking.

Room could have been cleaned better every day. I stayed 5 nights, tried to check out a day earlier but I was stuck since I'd booked through Hotwire and would be charged the night anyway. Parking in their garage $38 a day! Moved the car to the Westin garage (coincidence same name) for $18 a day. If you smoke you have to stand out in front and be bothered by scores of homeless begging money and cigarettes. Lobby had coffee set up but the coffee cart disappeared at 6 a.m. No place to eat during the day. Cafe and restaurant closed. Hours of operation of these were very limited. I finally moved for my last night down by the lake, Silver Cloud Inn. Better rooms, amenities and services than the Westin, and FREE parking in secure garage. I will never stay at the Westin in Seattle again and discourage any friends from doing so. Had to pay $6.00 to use their internet for 15 minutes. Free wi-fi if you have a laptop.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR39843774">I was looking for the best possible deal, in order to catch a baseball game, while in Seattle. Using "Hotwire", I got a "traditional" room for $95.00 US per night. This would be a "standard" room in most hotels. Unfortunately, the Westin site only provides photos of their "deluxe" rooms and none of the tripadvisor member reviews included pics, either. I've included them, in this review. The hotel has two towers - 40 stories each - with 3 elevators serving each tower. We were placed onto the 19th floor. I don't know if things are different on weekends - we were there mid-week - but we had no waiting issues whatsoever. The room had a nice city view and a king-sized bed. The headboard had separate dimmer lights so that either occupant could read without disturbing the other. Nice touch, I thought. Great sleeping. The mattress was very good quality. The staff and service was all great. Friendly and professional. One thing that we look for, when we travel to hotels, is room fridges. These rooms contain mini-bars, but not fridges in which to place your own stuff. We brought a small electric cooler and it was fine. The valet parking is expensive, but, if you're comfortable with it, there's a 24 hour parking lot directly across the street from the hotel. Great location. About $10.00 US, by taxi, to Safeco Field and a short walk to Pike Place Market. The pool was nice. Good for laps. The hot tub was above average if you like lots of jets. We enjoyed an awesome dinner experience at the "Ji Bacchus Sake Bar &amp; Bistro" at 1401 Broadway Avenue. Emiko was our hostess and she was wonderful. Excellent food menu - reasonably priced - and a top notch premium sake menu, too. Really...you should consider checking this place out. Given the price, I'd say it was a really great deal and hotel stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR39842847">Not luxury, but will do for a quick stopover. Lounge area tired look, needs renovation. Good location, quick walk uphill, downhill to the Pike's Mkt area. Bed is the best comfort, but carpet, furniture not pristine. Not easy to sleep well, as there are weird structural or machine noises during the middle of night, feel like I'm still on a jet, ugg! Very few bath products, hate when they dont even supply shower gel. Only shampoo, conditioner &amp; lotion. No bathrobe. There was a bowl of fresh apples on hall table 23rd floor, where I was first assigned a room (turned down this room as it smelled musty &amp; of stale smoke). No apples on 12th floor hall table. Take the short flight by elevator &amp; help youself. I will say the elevator wait was always short, so nice not to be kept waiting for an elevator! Concierge gave incorrect directions for a simple destination near the hotel. Had to ask locals for proper directions on the street. Needed to make a left and a right, but was told one block to the right. I detest wasting my precious travel time walking in circles! There is a McDonalds nearly next to hotel if you go down the escalator to the pkg area dropoff, cross the street and to the left.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR39682039">Location is everything in the Westin Seattle. I've stayed at several Westin hotels and this might be the best one, although it could improve a little on some issues: concierge was always crowded so you got information very quickly (and not so kindly) and felt you had to move so the other guests in line could be attended. Internet access is OVERPRICED. When are hotels going to realize they have to stop charging for internet access? I'd definitely go to another hotel which offers this at no charge. Elevators are so old they look vintage (I liked this) but the sound they make is horrifying. Great bathroom but water pressure was not up to the Westin standards. I booked a deluxe city view and it was worth it. We had a problem with room asignment but staff was quick and helpful (although not very kind) and changed us to another room. So close to great restaurants, shopping and the best spots in town.

Checkin and checkout could not have been smoother, orr quicker and all done with a friendly smile. The valey parking is expensive, but we knew that before we arrived and who can be bothered looking around for alternatives, when you can just hand your keys over at the front door...the valet was also very quick. Having read a previous review about the long wait for lifts, we had to laugh as no lift wait ever exceded 30 seconds, and we timed every one of them! The location is great, although if you haven't been to Seattle before yo umay be a little disappointed, as it is quite a drab city. Just near to the Westin is a great restaurant called Farestart, which provides 16 week training courses to the homeless and unemployed. On Thursday nights they have a different expert chef from the one of the top restaurants in Seattle come and plan out the menu...it was a great meal and a fantastic night...highly recommend it if you are communitty minded and love good foor...3 courses for only $25.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR38789599">I stayed at the Westin with my wife and 4-year-old son as we took a few days to explore the Seattle downtown area. I chose the Westin based mainly on its location and the fact that it offered a pull-out couch in the King rooms for my son to sleep on (I booked only a week before our trip, and most other hotels that could accomodate us were only offering double-double rooms). I also decided to spend a little more than I normally would for lodging, because we'd only be there a few days and wanted it to be special. Yes, I did spend more than I would have at the other nearby hotels I was looking at, but there was definitely nothing special about the Westin. In fact, it was very standard and like most other hotels I've stayed in. I should've saved $50 a night somewhere else or save $100 by using a bidding site. The location is very good. Right on the edge of Belltown and Downtown, next to the Monorail, and within easy walking distance of Pike Place. Everything was clean, though the carpets were worn and dated. Elevator service was awful, as there were only two per tower and waits were excessive (we actually almost missed our shuttle to the airport because of the elevators). Charges for internet would have been extreme, but I chose to utilize the free Wi-Fi at nearby coffee shops and cafes. Bottom line: The extra money you spend for a room at the Westin is a waste.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR38768953">Stopped in for one night on the way home from a wedding in Victoria, Canada, and the Westin lived up to it's standards. Loved the "Westin bed" and the "Westin bath"! We stayed in the South tower, 18th floor, and had a nice view of the city. The hotel is in easy walking distance to many sites and attractions. The monorail is also nearby. Booked through HotWire and got a great deal of $117, inc tax. Tips: We walked a few blocks down 5th Ave to Tula's for Sunday night jazz and dinner. Cover was $5, and the food and music excellent! And the next morning breakfast at the 5 Spot in Queen Anne neighborhood (you need a car). This month the theme was "Puerto Rico" -- it changes every 3 months. Great food and service -- fun for kids and adults. And our quick visit at Pike's Market on the way to the airport was fun. What's not to love about fresh flowers and food. You gotta try the "OMG Peaches!"<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR38179931">A couple of weeks ago, I finally managed to redeem a gift certificate for the Westin Seattle that I had purchased through a charity auction two years ago.We decided to take our 14 year old son along for a week in the city, so I added an additional day to make the weekend in downtown Seattle a memorable experience for my wife and son. It was memorable alrightâ€¦ I took the advice of a fellow Trip Advisor member to forego the hotel parkade &amp; save Â½ of the parking costs by utilizing the Westin Building parkade which is linked to the hotel by a walkway. As we unloaded the luggage from the car, my son &amp; I went looking for a luggage cart in which to transport our bags to the hotel room. We found one at the end of the walkway on the 2nd floor of the hotel near the meeting rooms. We took the cart back to where our car was parked, where we loaded up our luggage &amp; proceeded to the front desk to register. While I was checking into the hotel, my wife was approached by a bell attendant who told her that she could not use this cart. When she responded that it was left in the upstairs lobby near the walkway, the attendant then told her in front of other hotel guests the cart was his responsibility and that she should not have taken it and that he could get in trouble with his boss . My wife responded that maybe the hotel should have put a sign on it telling patrons to not use the luggage carts. The attendant then insisted that he bring our luggage up to the room. Unaware of the encounter that transpired, I proceeded to the hotel room along with my family, the bell attendant and our luggage. After he left, my wife then told me the story of what had happened. It reminded me of a scene from the English comedy â€œFaulty Towersâ€�. Since we were on a bit of a schedule, I chose to wait until I returned home to comment on this experience rather than make a formal complaint. I felt sorry for the fellow, as he appeared "stressed out" during my brief encounter with him.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR38105515">This Westin is pretty standard. Decent location downtown, walking distance to basically anywhere you would want to go (25 min walk to Safeco Field). Old, twin tower-style Westin, room on 20th floor had a decent view. Bed was fine, crappy flat screen t.v., bathrooms are small, poor amenities, but clean enough. Expensive parking, but Iâ€™ve decided people who park in those garages generally donâ€™t care about the $20-25 extra they pay for parking (which is cool). So for those folks, there is a valet,(although it looked like your typical hotel/valet/garage mess at peak times). Not a terrific value, but downtown Seattle is not cheap in terms of decent hotel rooms, so not a horrible either. Only stayed 1 weekend night, did not eat or drink at hotel. Bottom line: your typical, â€œB/B-â€œ Westin.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR38058135">I was sorely disappointed in the Westin. I thought I would be experiencing a truly rich delight, but that did not occur. First only one key worked, which is no problem, those computerized strips often do that, but when I went to the desk, the clerk was somewhat snotty stating it was the camera around my neck that did it. I did not have the key near the camera what so ever! The room was much smaller than the Sheraton and although the linens were very nice, the beds were not the â€œheavenly comfortâ€� as described. We had to shift the chairs to fit our needs and found filth, pure filth under the chairs, not to mention a few rolling grapes. The computer table was very dusty and even when the cords were moved; there was a cloud of dust. The air vent made a dripping sound most of the night, which did not help me to sleep at all. The room service was a delight, but no jelly accompanied the toast. You would think this would be part of the condiments, since there was 4 bottles of ketchup. Lastly, the pool was crowded which was no surprise, however, they kept jumping in and the splash became irritating, especially when the pool seemed rather cold. I thought Iâ€™d try the Jacuzzi to be overrun with kids swimming in there. The lockers in the womenâ€™s room did not work properly and no one could get them operating. The dirty towel hamper was overflowing and could have used attention. On a bright note, the car valets were great! Maybe my experience was isolated and although the price bid was good, I will not return. The Sheraton and Renaissance were far superior to the Westin.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37998511">I stayed at the Westin with my husband, mom and dad this past weekend for one night. We came to Seattle primarily to catch a game at Safeco. We got a great deal on two rooms through Hotwire, and although we had requested a king bed in each room, we were told when checking in that we were placed in adjoining rooms with two double beds. The pleasant lady checking us in told us we could have rooms with king beds but they would be on different floors (20th and 21st). That was no problem for us. The line-up to check in was fairly long as we arrived at 4:00, but it went surprisingly fast. We were happy with our rooms and other reviewers are right when they say the rooms are rather dated but the beds are heavenly. We had an iron burn in the carpet right in the middle of the room, but I had the best sleep I've had in ages! To me that is more important. The hotel is in the perfect location. It is easy to get to from the I-5, and within walking distance to everything. We didn't take a cab anywhere, but we do like to walk when we can - helps to work off all the great food! We even walked to and from Safeco even though we were told it is too far to walk to (it's about 30 minutes at a good pace). It helped that on the walk there we stopped for dinner and drinks, which did break up the walk nicely. The concierge was very helpful with our questions. The lobby bar was expensive, but it seemed like the normal price for bars in Seattle from what we could tell (we're just not used to paying $9 for a cocktail). I would not hesitate to book the Westin again, only next time I'll book for more than one night!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37739740">After researching many downtown Seattle hotels, we chose the Westin for a business/leisure stay. The location was convenient to walking to Pike Market, shopping, and great restaurants. The concierge service was impeccable. Ted, our man to go to, even lent my husband the belt off his pants, when my dear husband discovered he had left his own belt at home. Although our view wasn't of the Space Needle, we enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to revisit the Seattle Westin.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37624931">I can ditto almost everything I read in current reviews here. The service was great- what we expect from a Westin. The heavenly beds were exactly that- heavenly. Our view was even more heavenly! I had read in a previous review to make sure to see sunset from the room and wow- it is great. We booked a deluxe room and were offered an upgrade to deluxe waterview via email prior to arrival for only $10.00 more per night. We said yes! The first room they send us to was not a great waterview- only partial. When we asked to be moved higher- they said no problem and we had a view of the Space Needle, the bay and Olympia mountains. I will try to add a photo- I've never done that before. Go to this Westin for the view (get a waterview!), location, service and beds but do realize that it is not the larger, plush rooms with big bathrooms that you usually associate with the Westin hotels.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37158966">Things I liked - location - right downtown, within walking distance to the Public Market, etc - the Heavenly Bed - the view from the high floors Things I didn't like - carpet etc looked really dated (old and worn) - I was surprised - elevators are slow - they have 3 elevators servicing 40+ (?) floors. I was surprised at how dated the carpet etc was.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37068513">My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Westin from July 11-14 and then the night of July 16. We got a great rate on the Westin by bidding on Priceline, therefore I can not comment on the price of the hotel, because we got it for a steal. Our first stay we stayed in the south tower on the 18th floor. It didn't have much of a view, however, we good see a little bit of the Puget sound from our room. The towers (2) are round, so the rooms are a little odd shaped. However, they were very clean with plenty of room to move around in. Our room had a king size bed and was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. There was a flat-screen television and a couch that pulled out into a double bed. The closet was a decent size. Bathroom was nice but nothing to write home about. Our second room was in the north tower and on the 36 floor. The room had 2 double beds (bummer) but we had a beautiful view of Mt. Rainier. So that made up for the double beds. Positives: Clean, comfortable beds and good showers. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with your needs. I enjoyed the fitness room. All cardio equipment had it's own television. Great location! Easy 5 min. walk to Pike Place, 3 min. walk to monorail that takes you to the space needle. Plenty of great restaurants in easy walking distance. Great shopping, too! Negatives: In-room internet access is expensive ($10 per day) however, you can access their free wireless in the lobby. Just ask the concierge for the username and password. The small in house restaurant for breakfast is expensive! We would definitely stay here again. Please contact me if you any questions.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR37017593">Starting with the good things. I was pleased to be on the a top floor on the north tower. This is a great view of the water - can't be beat. Great downtown location !!!Also as always, the Westin has the best beds !!!. What this hotel does not have it great bathrooms - theirs are interchangeable with a blah Marriott - your basic bath/shower combo - nothing special. Also, the elevator noise is bad news. Avoid the hotel food.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR36731846">My Husband and I were down in Seattle for a couple days and we chose to stay at The Westin Seattle because we got a great deal on Hotwire. The front desk staff were extremely personable and friendly. Our room was on the 16th floor in the North Tower (there are two round towers that make up the hotel: the north and south towers) we had a nice view from our floor to ceiling windows of surrounding downtown buildings, the water, the monorail and the space needle. Our room was very spacious with a desk, king size bed, and a comfortable seating area (couch and chair) with lots of space to move around. The bed and bedding were extremely inviting and comfortable. The room has air conditioning which you control yourself which was definitely needed as Seattle was having a heat wave while we were there. There is a pool area which we checked out, the pool itself is indoors with a big outdoor balcony area right beside for sun lovers to lounge on. The hotel is in a great area, right in the downtown core within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants and attractions. If you are arriving by car note that the Westin Seattle has two parking options: valet (entrance located on Westlake Street) when we were there the rates were $39.00 from 5 - 24hrs. The other parking option is a self park garage (entrance located on 6th) and it was $36.00 from 5 - 24hrs. I think both valet and self parked cars are parked in the same garage. An elevator to the parking garage is located just outside the hotel entrance (by the valet parking area). Overall we were very happy with our stay at The Westin and would probably stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR35889748">1. Let's start with the address of the hotel, 1900 5th Ave. As a first time visitor, I didn't find out the motor entrance is on 6th Ave until I got out of my car and checked in. Then was told I'd to drive further. Maybe I was the only guest who had ever encountered this situation. The clerk checking in gave me unclear directions and enquiries made of another assistant yielded a hand-drawn map. Clear signage at the 5th Ave entrance would have been helpful. 2. The elevators were slow and creaky. If you are on a lower floor with luggage, you probably have to wait a few times before you can get in the elevator. 3. The hotel directory does't identify where the fitness centre is. We'd to call the operator to find out. 4. No blackout curtains. These are annoyances that are not worthy of a 4 star hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR35870225">Hotel is very well located to see the highlights of Seattle. Monorail to Space Needle/Experience Music Project/ Sci-Fi Museum is a few blocks away, easy walking distance. Same for Pikes Place Market and great local restaurants. Hotel seems to cater to business travellers which explains the coffee stains on the the carpet next to the desk. No joke. Stayed in 3 different rooms in same hotel. Coffee stains in 2 out of 3. BUT have to say after checking in very late (1am) and the next morning mildly complaining about the cleanliness of the room, we were upgraded (without asking) to a room on the top floor with a perfect view of the Space Needle. (Thank you Marissa!). Many fine local restaurants within walking distance nearby.(Top Pot for doughnuts, Serious Pie for pizza). There is also a drugstore one block over for any forgotten items. Check out the "Local Vine" for some great Washington wines! Staff very friendly and helpful Happy to make reservations for dinner etc..). BTW Taxi service in Seattle is awful. Waited 45 minutes for taxi to cruise pier that never arrived. Can recommened Daniel at Liberty Transport [--] who helped us out while he was there picking up another fare. Overall would definitely stay here again and would rec'd to anyone. Try out the "Washington Red Apple Martini" with free wi-fi in the lobby at hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR35371805">My Wife and I stayed at the Westin for a couple nights and we enjoyed the place! We had a room on the 6th floor and the room was great...clean, spacious, well decorated and the bed was awesome! We had a chance to go up to the pool one night and it was good, don't expect a water park but for a downtown hotel it was totally fine!! Also we had a couple drinks on the lobby...great! The lobby is super comfortable (at times a little busy, but, most hotel are!) you can get wifi for free at the lobby, we didn't want to pay $16 for wifi in the room! The service was great to get a drink while we were hanging out! The only major issue that I had with the hotel was the elevators!!! 3 elevator for 40 floor!!! Not enough, especially in the morning, a couple times we took the stairs since we didn't want to wait 10 minutes to get into one!! Also parking is expensive, $36, ouch!!!

The hotel is centrally located in downtown Seattle, a short walk to Pikes Market, Westlake Center, and central downtown shopping. The rooms are nice in the circular towers and the view of the cruise port was nice. Check in was a litte rough as the hotel was sold out the evening prior, but a nice touch was the offer of a call on your cell phone once your room became available. Room is spacious with amenities of a 3 or 4 star hotel. Only problem is the air conditioning is not sufficient when the afternoon sun beats in. Staff, including housekeeping and front desk were kind and attentive. Overall, a good stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR35083296">Its not a bad hotel, but I kinda expected a nicer room in a 4 star hotel. Maybe I am spoiled from staying in blinged out 4 star hotels in Vegas (serious bang for the buck there). The rooms are in serious need of an upgrade as they look very dated (popcorn ceilings and old carpet). There was also a musty kind of smell when we first walked into the room. That being said, the location is great, but there are many other hotels in the same area that are decent and probably cheaper (like Red Lion). I guess I can't complain too much since we got the room through priceline for $143 a night. We would probably try someplace else next time. However, if you can get a really good deal at the Westin, it is not a bad option.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34902552">The location of the hotel is excellent - walking distance to pretty much everything and right next to the monorail and free trams in case you don't want to walk. We booked via Hotwire and got the room for under $100 so it was great value too. I asked for a high room and got great city views - recommended. It is a circular building, so the rooms are a odd layout which makes it a bit different from most boxy hotel room. the lobby area whilst busy is very comfortable and offers free wifi to guests. My only complaints are that the room had a musty 'stale airconditioning' smell when you first went in, and that the plush bedding was a bit too warm for the room temperature. Otherwise highly recommended.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR34834110">We drove to Seattle from Edmonton and stayed here. I have never been to Seattle before, so making our way through the maze of one-way streets downtown there is a challenge unto itself. So, it seems, is parking. This hotel charges $36USD PER NIGHT to self-park your vehicle in their lot. Their valet is $39USD. I asked two different staff at the front counter when I checked in if there were any more cost-effective options in the area for parking. I was told (in these exact words) "I'm sure there are, but I don't know of any". Interesting that they both said the same thing....hmmm.... After going for a run the next morning, I happened to come back to the hotel from the west, just off of Lenora, onto Fifth Avenue where the hotel is. I was overjoyed to find that attached to the hotel with a PEDWAY of all things is a parking lot that charges $18 USD for overnight parking for hotel guests. How could the front desk staff "not know" of any other parking in the area when the Impark lot is ATTACHED TO THE HOTEL!?!??! That, in my opinion, is tantamount to deception and it really tarnished the good name and quality I expect from the Westin chain. If they're not being honest about the parking, what ELSE aren't they being honest about? Just food for thought. Everything else was fine. The room was clean and comfortable with a nice view of the space needle. Can't really complain about anything else...just the deception from staff regarding the parking situation really left me with a bad taste.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR34169471">We stayed two nights at Westin after 7 day Alaska Cruise. The hotel is centrally located in downtown area with easy walk to Pike Market, malls, restaurants and Monorail station. The room was very nice and the bed was plush. The Grayline runs bus service to and from hotel and airport, so was only $11 each to get to airport from Hotel. I took a chance on Hotwire and booked 4 star room and ended up with the Westin for a great price of $79 a night. Right a cross street from great restaurant called Icon Grill and two malls. Had a nice dinner at restaurant called Mexico in the Pacific Place mall. They have the best fitness center I have ever seen for a hotel. Also womens and mens locker rooms by fitness center and indoor pool plus hot tub.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR34166598">I am a member of Starwood Preferred Guest so naturally I opted to stay at The Westin during my recent visit to Seattle where we used the port for an Alaskan cruise. It was disappointing. While the hotel was not bad; it did not meet the standards I had hoped for based on its reputation and price point. During the first part of our stay, we came in from a day of sightseeing to discover that our room had been left open; it was a miracle that nothing was stolen. The hotel was nice enough to offer a complimentary breakfast when we reported the problem. We also witnessed a domestic altercation on our floor. On our return trip from the cruise we were able to check in early, which was nice. However, the room spelled like someone had cooked Indian food in it. There were no robes, shampoo and other amenities. We had to track down housekeeping staff to secure the shampoo. Robes never came even though the hotel website uses that as a selling point. We stayed on the Starwood preferred floor, but am not sure what that means since there seemed to be no difference from other floors. While the visit was not bad, it was simply not what we had hoped for.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR34010412">We've stayed at Westins all across the country and this one was very average. First off the pluses. The views were excellent. We had a top floor room on the 41st floor and had great views of the bay, the Space Needle, and Mt. Ranier. The lobby was pleasant and had free wi-fi access. But that's where the positives end. The rooms were very dated. The carpet looked like it hadn't been changed since the 1970s. It looked very old and run down and had stains everywhere. The bathroom wasn't much better. That is the most cramped bathroom I have seen in a long time. There is barely any room to stand. The shower, sink, and toilet are literally on top of each other. The light fixtures and wallpaper looked straight of the Brady Bunch. There needs to be some serious renovation here to bring it up to Westin standards. There is no full service breakfast place here. Breakfast was served by a counter service cafe. Not what you would expect in a hotel the caliber of a Westin. Overall, our stay was very average. The staff was good, but not great. The rate and location (close to a Monorail station) weren't bad. I would probably choose the Hyatt next time.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR33824381">The Westin is a nice hotel. Very centrally located to the major tourist attractions in Seattle. The studio sized room was a good size- a bit larger than studios usually are. Front desk check-in was slow.

Being Starwood Preferred members might have helped in our case. In any event, the room was great (recently re-furbished probably) and better located than our reservation had indicated. The staff were outstandingly helpful. The location was ideal - everything for first-time visitors was in easy walking distance. The highlight for us was the Seattle Museum of Art. Our restaurant recommendation : - the Pink Room (but make sure you get clear directions on how to find it - it`s easy if you know). The Paramount Theatre is a great venue if something interesting is on (it was) ; and the Benaroya concert venue is also excellent ; all these are within easy walikng distance.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR33031370">Stayed in this hotel in for a few days in early June for a conference. Got this hotel through priceline. There was a conference going on at the hotel and there seemed to be a good number of people staying there. Like what others have said before me, this hotel is in a pretty good location to all the touristy stuff in Seattle. I stayed here for a conference at the Washington Convention Center which is only a few blocks away. There was some construction going on outside of the hotel, but I was not bothered by any of that noise as I was at the conference most of the day. I traveled alone but was given a room with two beds. The beds were the most comfortable (and cleanest) I have ever slept in (you can even buy the bedding from a catalogue). This was the best thing about the whole room/experience at the Westin. The room itself was decorated nicely. The carpet was clean as was the bathroom. The bathroom itself could have used a bit of an upgrade (it was noticeably older than the rest of the room). Water pressure in the shower was good. The walls weren't thin and I didn't hear any neighbors, but I could through the door. I was near the elevators so this magnified that problem. Luckily, there weren't too many people getting off and on on my floor but when there were I could hear them pretty well. I believe because I got this hotel through priceline that I was given a "priceline" room, meaning I got a lower floor with no view to speak of, by the elevator, near the monorail (that takes you to the Space Needle) which you could hear from the room. I didn't mind too much though but only because I was at a conference for most of the day. If I was on vacation I think I would have appreciated the same room on a different floor. I didn't particularly find checkin/out staff helpful as they didn't ask me about my stay or tell me anything about the hotel amenities. As far as I know there is also no free internet, which is very inconvenient, especially for a hotel that can accomodate small conferences. Overall, this is a nice hotel, but I would not suggest paying the regular room rate. Find a good discount and it will be a better value for your dollar.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR33009203">My husband and I just got back from a long weekend in Seattle. We stayed at the Westin downtown. It has a great location, easy walking to all the fun stuff that Seattle offers. On the down side, it was not up to usual Westin standards. The buildings are round towers, so the rooms are pie shaped and very small. The bathrooms are equally small, barely room for one to use. The beds are the typical Westin Heavenly beds and very comfortable. The carpet was stained badly and our room was never cleaned until four or five in the afternoon. It is a very busy hotel with lots of convention and cruise ship traffic. We had asked for a view and were told our room had a very nice one, we were on the 37th floor, but looked across at the hotel's other tower. There is no sit down place for breakfast or lunch, just a starbucks type coffee shop. We ate at Coldwater Grill one night for dinner, very nice meal, but also pricey. One thing to watch out for, the MINIBAR. They do mention this when you check in, You touch it, you bought it. You get charged if you take an item out to read the label and put it back, so be warned. My husband and I booked this hotel as part of a package deal, so the price was right, but no way would I pay over $200 a night, the regular rate, for this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR32543670">Concierge extremely helpful and all staff very friendly.

Having stayed here previously, we knew what to expect in terms of location and amenities. Having said that though, the hotel has gone down a bit in quality since we were last in Seattle. The lobby and meeting areas are gorgeous and clean as usual, but the rooms are looking a bit drab and dingy. The grout on the floor of the bathroom was crusted with deposits, with the grout under the floating vanity the original clean white color. Needless to say we put towels down on the floor every day. The room carpet was stained in several places and felt thin underfoot. The carpeting had jagged edges and dust balls where it met up against the wall, almost like someone had forgotten to put baseboards in to cover the seam. The furniture also needs some refurbishment, one dresser drawer and one nightstand drawer had the bottom panel nearly popped out, and the desk chair had some padding coming through the seams. The bedding was a high point, Westin's Heavenly Bed is among the best I've ever experienced, with crisp sheets and a really nice pillowtop mattress. We slept great every night of the stay. We stayed on the 34th floor of the North Tower, which offers views of Puget Sound. However, there is a tall hotel/condo building under construction right across the street that has now blocked off a third of the view and light that usually comes in. Disappointing, to say the least, considering the price premium for water views. The location is excellent if you want to be able to walk to a lot of places. Pike Place Market is only a few blocks to the west, the waterfront and ferries are about a mile away, and for shopping the flagship Nordstrom, a large Macy's, lots of boutique shops, and the Westlake and Pacific Place shopping centers are within a block or two's radius. Benaroya Hall and the Public Library are also within half a mile, if you want to catch a performance or gawk at at modern architecture. If you like doughnuts, do yourself a favor and go to Top Pot Doughnuts a couple of blocks up 5th Ave. from the hotel. Delicious and inexpensive, snag a table on the second floor to people-watch as you chow down. We would stay here again due to the convenience, but would save a few bucks by going with a city view room. The value proposition is rarely there when you have such a good location, so we'll just note the few cleanliness issues to the housekeeping staff for next time. Positives: + Great location + Cab stand outside hotel + Westin Heavenly Bed + Great meeting rooms Not-so-great: - Rooms could be cleaner - Partially-obstructed views of waterfront due to construction - Pricey room service<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR31337199">After having stayed in the Edgewater and several other Seattle hotels, this hotel beats them all. I wrote a review with some pictures about this hotel a year ago as well. I had a few minor problems with my stay then, but this time not one bit. I stayed here again this weekend and the hotel is still superb. The entire staff was friendly, the hotel was very clean, and they upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 34th floor overlooking the city. Thank you Westin Seattle! I appreciate this hotel upgrading people to higher floors when they are not sold out! That's what I call good service. The rooms at this hotel are decently large with a very nice TV and superb views of the entire city. The hotel's pool was out of commission but they made up for it by offering free access to either the Sheraton's pool or the Warwick. They also were willing to pay the taxi fare to get to the pool! Wow. Nothing to complain about as this trip was 100% perfect thanks to the Westin Seattle staff!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR31016664">Stayed at this hotel for a week for a convention that had been booked years in advance . Truly odd timing for the westin to decide to rip up all the carpets in the lobby and run a jack hammer. Only thing odder was the decision to close the bar for renovations and have no restauarant. You would thing having the opportunity to sell to 7000 lawyers food and drink would be desirable , apparently not at this hotel . Bar staff was slightly handicapped by lack of english , it made receiving your drink such a surprise. Desk staff very helpful , although a fax I sent through them never arrived , on the upside they did not charge. Great view from the 34th floor room and good location.Parking too expensive and hard entarnce to find<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR30890790">The hotel's website says that the pool is currently under construction, which is why I was surprised to find the entire lobby and bar under construction as well when I walked in. There were planks covering every part of the floor and the lobby bar was completely taped off, behind plastic. The rooms are very small due to the particular shapes of the two towers and the views are limited unless you're on a very high floor; the good location and helpful staff isn't enough to save this Westin, especially as compared to the plethora of other (beautiful) hotels within walking distance. The gym was awful - a few pieces of random equipment in a 'closet' with no windows. The housekeeping staff trapsed through an employee-only door at the back of the gym three times during my 30 mt workout. About me - I'm a Platinum Starwood member so I always prefer Starwood properties and I'm typically pleased. This stay, however, was so bad that I moved to the Seattle Sheraton after two days.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR30874788">we stayed at the westin seattle for a long memorial day weekend. As soon as we walded through the door we noticed cardboard taped to the floor. At the service desk when we checked in teh furniture was all piled areound the perimeter of the lobby with the center area taped off. I asked upon check in if they were under renovation and was told they were just finishing up a lobby carpet project. When we got to our room we were not displeased but not overly excited about the room. We were on the 18th floor and had a great view of the space needle and the bed was awesome but other than that the room was nothing to write home about. We went to the swimming pool for a soak before getting ready for dinner. when we got there we found the entire area closed for renovation. I went to the customer service desk and was told that they don't tell people that the pool is out when they make reservations unless the customer asks. There was no sign at the desk upon check in to inform guests of the situation either. The man at the desk informed me that we could go to one of two other hotels to use their pool since they had arrangements with them for the time the westins pool is under renovation. I just feel the situation was completely unacceptable. I do not feel we received adequate customer service. We stay very frequently at hotels. I do not expect the red carpet treatment..just a reasonably comfortable stay with fair service. I will never stay at this hotel again...and I suggest if you are to stay there..inquire about the pool when you make your reservation. Also don't waste your time with the concierge or front desk...anytime I called the phone rang a minimum of eight times and then I was put on hold so long I hung up. parking was expensive ($38 per day I think). Internet was $6 per 15min in the lobby. I am not sure how much in the room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30852942">I've never had a problem with Westin hotels and this one was no different. Got a great deal for $89. I like the round towers which gives the room a cool layout. There was a great view of the city. Room service was expensive but good. Westin beds are always the best. I felt very comfortable in this hotel. The bellman was very helpful and told me about the Airporter bus which saved me a lot instead of taking a cab to the airport.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30767780">The Westin Seattle has a great central location that is a 10 minute or less walk to all the things we had planned including Pike Place, the Monorail (90 second ride to the Space Needle), the flagship Nordstrom store, and lots of great restaurants (we went to Serious Pie, Palace Kitchen, The Crumpet Shop, Le Panier, and various Pike Place spots on our Savor Seattle tours). The room is what you would expect from a Westin and at the price I paid (under $90), it was perfect!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30687662">The Westin, Seattle is located in the heart of the downtown area. Hotel is adjacent to the monorail line - which runs to the Seattle Center (Space Needle area) .Two twin circular towers - north and south, make up the room floors for this hotel. The circular design of the building gives some pleasant aesthetics to the rooms as the windows are gently curved and go from the floor to ceiling. While the building is not new, this design element gives an elegant look to the shape of the rooms and interior. Interior of the rooms are done in soft beige tones. Coordinating colors throughout the room and bath area. Dual shower heads and a Toto toilet add to the nice touches. Ice machines are on every floor. King size bed was very comfortable although the pillows were a bit flat. Flat screen TV and a cordless telephone was present in the room. Now the devil in the details - The pool is out of commission - they say until the end of May 2009. The front desk offered to reimburse taxi fare if we went down to the Sheraton to use the pool there. To some it may be 'Sleepless in Seattle' but the reality is its usually 'Raining in Seattle'. The Sheraton is too far especially if you're just looking to use the pool with kids. Valet parking is a staggering $38 a night and self park is $30 a night. Not even a block away you can find parking lots for $17 a night and they are run by a national parking company. Overall the Westin, Seattle is a solid 4 star hotel - Assuming the pool out of commission is a once in a blue moon oddity - i'll let it slide for now. If you book on a deal site like Priceline or Hotwire, this hotel can be had for an exceptional value.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR30645001">I booked this hotel over the phone and one week later, I received a cancellation notice without my approval for the reservation. When I inquired with the hotel, the receptionist told me that their computers were down but that she would re-reserve my room. She didn't seem too concerned though which led me to book another hotel altogether. An odd occurence but certainly important enough to mention. It would have been awful to arrive at the hotel only to learn that my reservation had been cancelled.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30296456">we really liked the location of this hotwire.com room. And the price($80.00US) for this 4 star hotel. And, yes, we paid a lot for parking but we've found this to be true anywhere downtown and we prefer to pay for secure parking and walk, so location means more to us. The view was beautiful as were the furnishings, flat screen TV and beautiful bathroom. But the swimming pool and spa were under going renovations and we couldn't get any sports channel with the Western Conference NHL playoffs. However, we had a good dinner out(at Moma's Mexican Resturant, Bell Town, an old favorite)within a short walk and a great walk to Pike Street Market the next morning, Mother's Day, so lots of beautiful flower vendors out. It didn't bother us too much but there were a lot of guests going on a cruise the next morning and the elevators were tied up for almost two hours with people trying to get on them and get checked out and to their cruise ship on time. We were on the 15th floor and after waiting 15 minutes, took an 'up' elevator, so we could go 'down'. The car was full by it's second stop down but then stopped at every floor!! all the way down, 35 of them. Maybe all cruise ship passengers need to be checked in, on lower floors instead of the highest. They all seem to need to be at the ship at the same time. But our stay was great!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR30210027">My husband and I stayed at the Westin for an anniversary weekend in May. The view from our room on the 42nd floor was amazing. For the price of the room we were very disappointed with the cleanliness (there was dust on everything when we arrived), and the quality. There were no local TV channels on the television, there was only one bedside table in the room also. We had to move furniture to get full benefit of the view of the Seattle skyline. At the time we were there the swimming pool wasn't available to use, they were providing taxi's to another Sheraton for those who wanted to use a pool. The lobby was blocked off the whole weekend and was difficult to navigate around things while they were laying down carpet. We were within walking distance to many activities which was nice. When we come back again we will definitely chose a different hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30014474">Traveled to Seattle to hangout with a friend for a couple days and stayed at the Westin while out there. The staff was great, very helpful with any questions I had about the area and awesome with tips on where to eat. Room was nice size, very clean and nicely furnished. I didn't spend to much time in the area but if I was to come out again I'd have a tough time staying somewhere other than The Westin. Was a decent price as well.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR28138110">We arrived for 1 night stay before flying home. We were on the 26th floor with a pretty good view..Upon entering the room there was a huge iron burn in the middle of the floor. The room was spacious with plenty of nice floor to ceiling windows for the view. We dined in the restaurant where the service was wonderful and the food was decent. We returned up to our room to find us fighting with the Tv all night. I would not turn on/off change channels etc...We went to sleep. In the morning the Tv would not even turn on. I called down and they sent someone up...3 hours later they finished the Tv issue, our broken coffee pot, and a shower head spraying the entire bathroom were just the finishing touches. We had someone in our room from 7am unitl nearly 10am trying to fix all of the problems. It was time now for us to check out! Why no one thought to move us is beyond me...Relaxation, no not there. Updating, really needed. We got a free breakfast from the express captain but when we told the front desk of our disappointment and problems of the morning all we got was a "Oh I am sorry, would you like your receipt in an envelope??" I emailed the hotel upon returning home with our experience, no response to date. So I resent another saying there has been no response...Still none... Customer service/management really needs improvement. Beware if you encounter problems with your stay because their problems become yours.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR27847320">Once into our room the front desk called to see if everything was to our liking. We were on the 32nd floor and looking right into a construction crane - they moved us to the 42nd floor, much better view, same room. Stepping into the "heavenly" shower this morning, the smell of mold smacked my nose - the mold was growing between the tiles... maybe the room hadn't been let for a while but you'd think the Westin would do better than this...

Two wine glasses in the room, given there is wine in the bar, would be great and at least four water glasses..two int he washroom and tow in the main room would have been better.

Not once was I told that they were doing construction nearby (I called several times). There is construction going on across the street from the South and North Towers. The construction started at 6:00am until 7:00pm. Just when I thought I would get a break on Saturday it started at 7:00am. The rooms are very outdated. This isn't the nicest Westin I have stayed at. I only stayed at this hotel due to the location and price. My original plan was to stay at "The Inn at the Market". They couldn't guarantee me a water view so I canceled, big mistake on my part. Seriously spend the extra money and stay at the "Inn at the Market". The hotel is beautiful and small. Back to the Westin, I was able to check in at 11:00am and was very happy about the early check in. I informed the front desk clerk that it was my birthday and could I get upgraded. He sent me to the South Tower. The room was really small and had a view of a building under construction. The room also had a big stain on the floor (I'm thinking animal urine). I couldn't figure what was the upgrade. The room looked like a basic room (nothing special). I went back down and spoke to another clerk she said she could put me in the North Tower (which has water views). She did inform me that it would have double beds though (fine with me). The clerk that originally helped me came over and loudly said "What's the problem I put you in an upgraded room", which I found rude considering he didn't know what I was asking from the second clerk. I apologized for the confusion and informed him that I thought the "upgrade" would be a water view. I went to the second room and this had a water view but it also had a view of construction that was going on across the street. The room was a little dirty, the night stand had a layer of dust on it and one of the curtains was coming down. Also this room had a small stain on the floor as well. The only thing that was not dated in this room was the bedding. This hotel seriously needs to be updated. I paid $150 per night (and felt ripped off) and I wouldn't recommend spending over a $100 a night. (Especially with all the noise due to the two construction sites). Again, the location is great and there are tons of restaurant to go to that are in walking distance. You can also catch the airport shuttle right outside of the hotel. I do plan on going back to Seattle next year but next time I will stay at "The Inn at the Market".<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR22002969">Stayed at the Westin for 2 days on the "Holiday Shopping Package" $199/night + a $100 gift card to Pacific Place per night. Location: Downtown Seattle everything is within walking distance. Hotel is located between the monorail and the streetcar so if you're looking for a quiet hotel I would suggest trying a different one. Hotel: Is dated needs some renovations, but I was not disappointed overall. Food: The main restaurant is in winter hours so I did not have a chance to try it. Shopping: Everything is close by Macys, Nordstroms, 2 malls and many retaliers have a street presence. Most stores open till 8 at night and the streets felt very safe. Also check with the concierge desk as they can give you discount coupons or freebies to some stores and restaurants.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21878168">This Westin hotel is located close to the Monorail Station and Westlake Center, a short walk from Pike Place. Its a good location in a city that's easy to get around. The room was spacious with superb bed and well-equipped. However, the decor was slightly dated and the whole feel of the hotel was rather disappointing. The lifts, lobby, corridors, and restaurant all need freshening up. Breakfast was average, with a slightly disappointingly small choice at the buffet, and rather pushy staff overly trying to persuade customers to choose the expensive a-la-carte options.

Great customer service. We're upgraded to a king deluxe room on the 36th floor overseeing the city, but the room smells like B.O! We called the front desk, customer service switched us to another room on 41th floor right away. The cons: The room is outdated. Molds in the bathroom, not so heavenly towels and showerhead (the showerhead is stained with brown mildew, yew!). The first room on the 36th room South tower smells like B.O. The second room on the 41th floor North tower is clean overall, but the bathroom smells like sewage!

Not the prettiest place from the outside! However, the interior - from the reception area to the hallways to the rooms - is typically pleasant like most Westin properties. I stay at Starwood properties more than any other chain and this one is your typical, cookie cutter Westin (aside from the exterior!). In general, the place is well-maintained and the staff relatively professional. The rooms are a little on the small side, but for a downtown hotel in a major city, they are a good size. The Westin bed is amazing!!! Love them! One negative about the room was the smell - it was musty, almost like it used to be a smoking room and had not been properly aired out since it went non-smoking. I was not alone in this observation (I was in town for a major conference and had many colleagues/peers staying at the Westin). Great location - right in downtown, near some great restaurants (go to Dahlia!!!) but not exactly right in the middle of the madness, like the Grand Hyatt or Sheraton. Decent reception staff - accommodating, if not slightly bored-acting, which is odd considering the amount of time the keep you on hold when calling from your room; the housekeeping staff were very nice. All-in-all, a good stay here. For $200/night (which seems to be harder and harder to come by nowadays...), this property is fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20919331">We just got back from Seattle. We stayed at the Westin Hotel in Downtown Seattle for 5 days. We booked our hotel through priceline. We were very pleasently surprised. Great hotel service from the front desk to the parking valets.

When we arrived by airport shuttle (greyline, very convenient!), we were promptly checked in by a nice gentleman (Brian). We asked for a space needle view and we were granted that wish with a smile. There are 2 towers, so make sure you know what tower you are because they have totally opposite elevators. Our room was 4432. We had a direct line view to the space needle. Gorgeous! The room was nice. It had 2 heavenly beds, a nice double head shower (kind of low set), no name toiletries, a desk, TV, internet access from noon-noon for $10, a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, hair dryer, &amp; closet. Not like some of the Westins I have stayed in but overall it was really nice. The view made it great. This hotel is right downtown but it is a 7 block or more walk to The Pike Place market and piers. Though, the hotel is right by the monorail to the space needle ($4 round trip) we walked it and it took like 15 minutes tops. The concierge people were extremely helpful when planning tourist events or making dinner arrangements. They even had coupons for a cruise through the locks. I did slip getting in the tub and I bruised my shin but, that is probably my fault. The conference facilities were nice and the food they served was good as well. I would stay there again. But maybe would consider a place closer to the market and water next time if it was the same cost. This hotel is priced very competitively with other hotels in its class making it a great overall value.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20861920">The hotel is in the heart of downtown and walking distance from everything you need. We stayed overnight after going to a play at the Paramount and it was a nice walk back to the hotel. The bed was comfy and room service was pretty fast. There is also a little convenience store a block away so you can avoid the mini bar prices. I agree with other reviewers that you get a room to match the price you pay. We used the Name Your Own Price feature and payed 1/2 the price listed on the Westin's website. We ended up with a small room right by the elevators and could hear the people talking in the hall.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20831930">We picked the Westin for it's location as it was right in downtown Seattle also the pictures on the website looked like it was a very nice hotel. Before we travelled we were sent an email offer to upgrade to a deluxe room with a view, we decided to do this as we had not been to Seattle before and it would be nice to have the view. At check-in the girl on reception must have been having a bad day she wasn't that friendly, we were never offered any assistance with our luggage so took it ourselves. We were put on the 47th floor which did give us a great view but the room was disappointing it was a bit older in decor than we expected from the pictures. The bathroom was clean although there were 3 long hairs stuck to the wall of the bathroom and probably are still there now !! if we could see them I'm sure the housemaid could as well. We had an issue with drycleaning, not the hotels fault but we sent drycleaning for same day service and by 9.30pm had to phone to find out where it was. The drycleaning company had a power failure and we were told it would be another hour before it was delivered, we were happy with that but the next morning it still had not arrived and we were checking out once again we had to chase it up and it was sitting somewhere in the hotel and was then bought to our room.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20512346">We stayed at the Westin Seattle for two nights (September 20th and 21st) before boarding a four-day Pacific Northwest cruise with Celebrity Cruises. The Westin Seattle is perfectly located. It's very close to all the fancy shopping malls and stores in downtown Seattle. Itâ€™s also a short walk away from the famous Pikeâ€™s Market. As for getting over to Seattle's Space Needle, the monorail station is right outside the hotel and the views from our hotel room on the 34th floor were just magnificent. Overall, it's a very nice hotel, but it shows signs of age, such as in the doors, carpeting and television set that was provided with our room. As for service... well, that's still debatable. On our first morning, we woke up late and left our room at approximately 11:00 AM. Before leaving, I removed the "Don't Disturb" door handle sign and placed it on the bathroom counter. When we returned later in the afternoon at approximately 5:30 PM, we discovered the cleaning staff had left a small card inserted into the electronic door lock on our door. The card apologized for not being able to service our room because we had apparently left the "Don't Disturb" sign on our door. Funny, there was no "Don't Disturb" sign on the door handle when we returned, just the card from the service staff. So what "Don't Disturb" sign were they referring to????? It was left on the b bathroom counter. Personally, I believe that whoever was working that morning just ran out of time or they were just plain lazy since it was so late in the morning when we left. Therefore, the more than likely decided they didn't have time to service our room and instead left the courtesy card, which sucks when you consider I paid $578 for two-nights at this particular hotel. However, when I brought this to the attention of management, they promptly had the room serviced with an apology. Overall, we would stay at the Westin Seattle again because of its close proximity to all the main activities in downtown Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR20475224">We booked our stay through hotwire and got a great deal at about $130 a night. I have to agree with the previous poster though, in that I think that the Westin provides different quality rooms for people who book through online discount services. When we first checked in, the lady even acknowledged that we had booked through hotwire. But for what we paid, the hotel was great! Clean rooms, albeit some stains on the carpet, a nice pool, and a great location. This hotel is great for all the central activities such as the Market, Space Needle (hop on the monorail) and great dining. All that being said, if we would have paid the $300 a night that the rooms were going for and recieved the room we did, we probably would have been a bit upset. Oh, and one other thing.....don't expect any above and beyond "extras." The internet was 6$ for 15 minutes on their computers (free airline boarding pass print-out though), refrigerator stocked with pricey!!! items such that you cannot put anything else in there, and stains on some of the linens and mattresses. Again, it seems it was a case of you get what you pay for so we were not upset, but definitely will never pay full price if all the rooms are like that!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20046649">This was the third Westin I had stayed in within a week (please see my other reviews for the ones in Columbus, Ohio and San Francisco), and it was not up to the Westin standard. First impressions count - and the rugs in the lobby were fraying along the edges. Front desk staff was amenable, but nothing above and beyond, considering the price tag. My room was clean and everything in working order, but I think it was smaller than an average hotel room - this may have been an optical illusion, as the hotel tower is rounded, so the rooms are round, rather than rectangular along the outside. It could be a really neat effect, but I don't think the room was oriented to make that happen. Room service breakfast was good, but overpriced (even for a Westin). When reading previous reviews of this hotel, I noticed that one reviewer mentioned that the thread count on the sheets was not up to Heavenly Bed standards - I almost brushed it off, but then I got into bed - and the reviewer was absolutely right! Having just come from two nights at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco, the sheet texture was totally different and not as smooth. Don't get me wrong - the hotel is still better than your average hotel, and has all the amenities of a Westin. I just think that there is room to improve, especially given the $200+ price tag for the average business traveler. But one odd compliment - for a hotel with nearly 40 stories, I never had to wait long for an elevator!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19891569">I stayed at the Westin Seattle for 3 nights in early September 2008. The hotel is very nice, which has been my experience with Westin hotels elsewhere. I stayed on the 10th floor of the South Tower. At that level there is really no view other than buildings. The higher floors probably had better views, or as I discovered when I reserved the room, you can pay extra for a room with a better view. No complaints about the room, the "heavenly bed" is everything it is billed to be. I was a bit disappointed that there was no robe provided in my room. I had always had one before when staying at a Westin. The location is great. It is right downtown, about a block from the monorail, a block from the trolley and about 6 blocks from the Pikes Place market. I ordered room service one night, which was extremely overpriced. In that area there are many restaurant and I should have planned ahead and ordered take out from somewhere else. I did not use the pool or hot tub although I went and looked at them. They seemed small for the size of the hotel, but very nice and clean. The workout room was also small. The service was very good, with the exception of a somewhat rude front desk manager when I checked in. You should also be aware that this entire hotel is non-smoking. Smokers have to take it outside. Overall, I would stay there again if I ever was to visit Seattle again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19863576">I spent a single night in the Westin Seattle and left a favorite jacket in the closet as I left the room. I wasn't worried as I reported the missing jacket just six hours after check out, and I was still in town for a few days. But it was nowhere to be found, and it was only after three inquiries that anyone seemed to pay any attention to trying to track it down. The jacket has not appeared, and the only logical conclusion is that a hotel employee now has a very nice jacket. This could be expected at a budget accommodation, but not at a supposedly fine hotel.

Particulary the front desk clerk Hillary who sent chocolate fondue with strawberries up to my daughter for her 13 birthday. We had an great view from our room, everything was clean and functioned well, the pool was a treat and the location couldn't be better. The beds were luxurious.

We had to call to have them changed. How gross. Hotel would not provide a receipt showing $0 due for incidentals. I thought that was quite odd. Hotel doesn't do the typical "express checkout" where they deliver a receipt to your room. Very pricey parking. We dumped our rental car, rather than pay $39/day to park. Very pricey on-site restaurants No one there gave good directions, including the concierge Concierge seemed quite put off by any questions Staff were "stuffy"<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19520480">Overall this is a nice hotel, with an excellent location, close to great shopping, and business, and Seattle Center, and Library. Rooms are spacious enough. However the Heavenly Bed which is supposed to be 250 thread count sheets was clearly not what they claim. They had us sleeping on thread bare, pilled sheets, that could give anyone a good exfoliation. The only sheet that was like this , was the bottom sheet...which of course needs to be 250 thread count to be slippery , and comfy. This persisted for 6 nights....and on the last 2 nights I finally got them to put a TOP sheet on the bottom as well. Those last 2 nights were great. too bad I had to get up at 3 in the morning for my plane. I can only imagine why they were using such poor sheets....either they were trying to save money and bought 180 thread count sheets....or they were just OUT of regular sheets due to the completely booked hotel, and had to use "loaners" or something. they offered no explanation to me thus far. Overall, they have a nice staff, and I did not have any other complaints.....however we were there to get good nights rest, and the Heavenly Bed is supposed to provide just that. And keep in mind that Parking is $36- $38 per night...which added about $360 to our stay! yikes! I am still awaiting response from the management to see what can be done to amend the situation. I will report back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19516916">My husband and I got the Westin Seattle for one night on a Priceline bid. We got a great rate and I was excited to get the Westin since Frommers Seattle marked it as one of the best hotels in the city. We were very dissapointed with the Westin. The hotel is HUGE and not laid out well at all. It is very much geared toward the business traveler and there was always a ton of activity going on in the massive lobby. When I checked in at the front desk the person helping me was not friendly at all. The person who was checking in next to me got an upgraded room and friendly conversation, and all I got was someone who wanted to check me in as quickly as possible and get on his way. Our room was right next to the elevator, which most of the rooms are because of the poor layout. I had requested a high floor because I read that the views were incredible, but we really had no view from our room. The bed was comfy, as are all Westin beds and overall the room was a nice size with a basic bathroom. Heavenly shower was nice. I would not stay here again. The rooms were nice, but the staff was unfriendly and the atmosphere in the hotel was really geared toward conference attendees and business travelers.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19334473">Luckily I got this room through Priceline for $125, but unluckily I was locked in for three nights. I would have changed hotels after the first night. I was on the 17th of 40 some floors. ( North tower, facing the sound). I could see the Space Needle off to my right but directly in front was a new building going up. Pile drivers and the sound of a groaning crane began at 4 AM. Even with ear plugs, you could not drown out the sound. Make sure that you ask to see your room first to know if you are facing this way. The new building is up to the 10th floor as i write this, but it looks like this will be going on for a while. If you are booking any time in September I would ask about this. Weekends might be OK. I was there Mon - Wed. Another issue is the lack of a little fridge. They only have a minibar so you are really stuck if you want to save a dime by having a few snacks of your own. They want you to eat in their restaurant, (Coldwater Grill). It was raining hard so I opted to eat there. It was pricey, but they had this wonderful dish..ravioli stuffed with peas and ricotta on a bed of really fresh broccolini. As others have commented, this place is fancy, with fluffy beds and good views, but it has as a huge, impersonal corporate feel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR19289152">During a tour of the Pacific North West, we had pre-booked a junior suite at a rate of c.$470 per night. Upon arrival at the 21st floor, the musty smell of neglect and tobacco (in spite of its smoke-free claims) hit us. The suite turned out to be 2 adjacent (not adjoining) rooms which were dark, unclean, uncared for and just plain shabby. The bed base was stained, the bathroom was tiny and had no separate shower and the general facilities (incl. an ancient t.v.) were more befitting a cheap motel. We immediately compained and asked for a more modern suite, only to be told that none was available, with an added confession that the hotel was "overdue for renovation". To their credit, the manager and desk clerk dealt with us in a courteous and professional manner, and called the Pan Pacific for us, which it turned out, was far superior, more spacous, clean and beautiful and due to its recent opening, much cheaper ($291). As a result of this experience, we immediately cancelled our booking for the Westin in Vancouver (later on our tour) and changed to the Pan Pacific, which was yet again superb. Sadly, i think Westin are sliding downhill and resting on laurels of former glory....simply not good enough in today's market!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19250457">We stayed at the Westin Seattle in August for three nights and would definitely stay here again. This is a very large hotel, over 800 rooms, but other than the concierge usually having a line I never really felt like we were in a big, difficult to navigate hotel, which was nice. The location was good and there are many nice restaurants within walking distance. I originally booked a base room on the hotel's web site. The next day I got an email from the hotel with several upgrade offers. For an additional $100/night we were able to upgrade to a parlor suite (2 bed/2bath) which was a great deal for two rooms. When we arrived they gave us the option of taking two connecting rooms with deluxe views instead of the suite in the other tower. The views from our rooms, 3931 and 3932 in the North Tower, were amazing!! We were directly facing the Space Needle with Elliott Bay to the left. The rooms have been redone and are very spacious. As we expected, the Westin Heavenly Beds are, well heavenly! Although the concierge desk was usually busy Christine helped us with a smile and was able to get the dinning reservations I asked for. The pool and exercise room were nice as well. We enjoyed a quick, hot breakfast in the Fifth Ave. Corner CafÃ© every morning. There is a small computer center in the lobby with an hourly charge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19057581">This is a very well located hotel: blocks from the Pike Market, one block from the monorail and walking distance from much in Seatlle. The buildings, twin tall cylindrical towers, are easily located while walking around, so it's highly convenient for the directionally challenged. What about the inside of the hotel? There is a nice pool with a sky roof, a couple decent work out rooms, a little cafe with ok croissants, good food in the lobby bar area. The rooms have spectacular views (ranging from great to truly spectacular), nice heavenly beds. The not so great: some gross carpet stains and mediocre housekeeping. Otherwise, the staff was helpful if not effusively friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR19028751">Stayed here in August. Enjoyed the stay. Hotel is centrally located - I walked to the man tourist spots like the Space Needle, Pikes Market, and even walked to the Mariners baseball game one night.

Take a look.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18458349">My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights before our Alaskan cruise. Great Hotel,,walking distance to it all. Pikes market was 2 blocks away.The Tram was right across the street.It takes you to the space needle. But tha cab is cheaper. Beds are soft. The rooms are slightly outdated and could use a revamping. But overall its a good hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR18319179">We arrived late and tired after a flight from NYC. Receptionist was efficient but unfriendly - no help with our luggage. Foyer was huge but a bit frayed at the edges - in need of an urgent refurbishment We were on the 31st floor with sea view - lovely - but the room was not that big and I think the could do with upgrading -the bathroom floor could do with a good scrubbing. We had breakfast in restuarant and found it good value and bettervalue than the smaller cafe on the premises. -. Concierges very good - great tip for 50 cent oysters on shore cafe and happy hour. Well placed for most tourist sites. Space Needle expensive for what it was but good tourist talk given. Pike market quite good - people friendly- loved Seattle<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18257623">This was a nice enough hotel. We got a good deal online so whatever it ended up being we were ok with. The price for parking is outrageous so I probably would not return simply for that reason, well maybe if I don't have a car next time. The hotel is in a good area, pretty close to the monorail if you are interested in riding it and a short enough walk to Pike's Place Market. We did have one unfortunate experience with the staff. My husband called down to guest services our first night and asked the gentleman who answered if he was who he needed to speak to in order to request a wake up call. The gentleman who answered was very rude and replied in an unpleasant tone "what time." My husband said 7am and the gentleman hung up on my husband. Needless to say the next morning we did not receive a wake up call. We meant to complain but didn't want to let it ruin our vacation so we brushed it off. Besides that little bump the rest of our stay was smooth.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR18207459">it felt so good to get back in our room each night, into a wonderfully comfortable bed with loads of pillows. the apples on each floor were delicious. the only negative was 1 non helpful concierge who gave us wrong information. the restaurant never had very many customers so we never did try it out. very good location.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17738360">First, I want to say that this property is nothing like any Westin I have stayed at before. It's in need of major refurbishment. We were bumped, or as they like to say, "walked" to this hotel from the Seattle Sheraton due to the Sheraton staff overbooking many rooms. We were given a room that needed serious cleaning. The carpet was dirty and stained and there were some long black hairs on the bathroom counter. Unlike the Sheraton, where internet is free, the Wi-Fi cost almost $20 a day. The power strip, on the desk, was malfunctioning and I had to call for an "engineer" to come fix it so I could charge my computer. Even after the Sheraton promised they would cover our expenses for the inconvenience, the Westin still charged us for internet, two local phone calls and parking. I've since requested a refund.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17649316">I was in town for a convention from June 7-11. Great location: This was an awesome location for shopping, dining, and walking distance to Pike Place. The convention center was literally a block away but not connected to the hotel. Hotel dining: I did not utilize room service but for being a Westin, I expected a little bit more. There is only a Ruth Chris and a Starbucks at this location. Room: Very nice room that can fit two people comfortably.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR17614110">There for a weekend seminar. Two towered, large property in a good location, fairly quiet neighborhood, the retro-cool monorail going right by. Very pleasant lobby, generally friendly front desk staff ( I lost my cellphone and when I reported it, I kept being asked if I knew where I lost it...), nicely done rooms given odd shape (towers). Had couch and lots windows. Meeting room fine; yummy smoked salmon and pastries there! Had a hot tub and pool with a balcony-neat. Could have been cleaner, though- stained carpet, obvious dust and the bathroom floor needed a scrub brush. Sorry, but for the price ($250/night), I don't think it's too much to ask.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR17570341">We booked a Fri/Sat stay through Priceline and got a wonderful deal. After driving from San Francisco up the coast, we were hoping to find comfortable accommodations to relax in....we were taken aback by the Wonderful Heavenly Beds....the most comfortable thing I have ever laid on! We booked a room with a King bed and a sofa bed, and after a night on the town were disappointed to find the sofa bed was not made up. Rather than call downstairs and wait for someone to come up, the 3 of us slept in the King size bed and were pretty comfortable considering (the next day we had the sofa bed made up). Other than that, the room had a nice swivel tv, beautiful view of the city, nice furniture and bathroom, and we ended up on a "Preferred Guest Level" (we stopped off the elevator on other levels to see if each level was preferred, but we seemed to be one of the only ones!). I don't know exactly what benefits that gives you, but they did have fresh Washington apples on the table in the hallway each morning is almost next door). Parking was about $35 at the hotel, which is a little silly considering that there is a building next door that offers parking for $18, but it was nice to call down and have the car ready and waiting, although we really didn't use it once we checked in. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that they catered to a lot of bus tours, and there was almost always a wait to catch an elevator to get to your room. We tried to be evasive and go up or down a floor to pick it up without the traffic, but it never worked. Other than that, I would highly recommend this hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14833954">We booked through travelocity. When our flight was cancelled due to snow and ice and delayed a full day out, Westin refused to refund 1 of our 2 nights. For a 200+ per night hotel, that seems a bit greedy. Not to mention, the view wasn't that great, the air didn't work at all (barely slept that night). I expect at a minimum the air to work for a $$$ room. Still waiting to hear back from Travelocity whether or not they will refund us (they told us they would BEFORE we left town and then refused when we got back). We also happily ate the cost of the rental car for that extra day. We won't be dealing with either any time soon...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR13739940">It's a really nice hotel, especially for the business traveler hoping to unwind. They know who they are catering to and they don't miss a step. They're not going for a hip, spare atmosphere, but catering to what urban travelers want. I also like it because there's an indoor pool, it's downtown, the views are amazing, so when I can score a sweet deal to make it somewhat affordable, I'll take the Westin. The rooms are wonderful. There all the nice smelling shampoos, shower gels, etc, that you'll want to take with you. And the linens are so soft and cozy you might splurge for room service breakfast and even beg for a late checkout. The large hotel lobby with the big soft chairs is great for meeting friends for a cocktail before dinner. There are plenty of very nice hotels in downtown Seattle, and while I like to mix things up when I visit, the Westin is a consistent favorite.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR12426736">First, because of booking through expedia, we got assigned a room with a very average view and not on an elevated floor (although we requested it specifically). We had issues with the housekeeping mostly: no attention to details, some hair here and there upon arrival, carpet stains, no proper restocking of towels, soap or coffee ...I constantly had to make requests to their 'service express' which was annoying. I found the hotel charmless and very cold and will never return. Other than that the staff was friendly.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR12167531">I stayed at the Seattle Westin for two nights in Seattle. The property is of typical Westin quality. It had a great bed, amazing views and a convenient location. However, I once again felt sort of screwed by the Westin's policy towards people who redeem reward points. The hotel is now a non-smoking facility. However, it obviously wan't always this way. I can't remember in which tower we stayed or on what floor, but I believe it was around the 21st. While I our room was nice, it has a DISGUSTING SMOKE SMELL. In fact, I sometimes smoke and was offended by the smell of the room. Of course, nothing else was available, so we had to deal with it. We bought some candles at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and the management did send up an industrial air-scrubber, which worked pretty well while it was there. Once it was gone, it was back to that awful smoke smell. I understand that Starwood is in business to make money, but it's really embarrassing to put patrons in that room in that condition. I would recommend looking elsewhere until they fix that problem.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11975149">We stayed at The Westin Seattle August 12-15, 2007. We loved this hotel. The rooms are a good size with a sitting area and a very comfy bed. This hotel is located in the heart of downtown so you can walk to shopping, Pike Place Market and many restaurants. The staff was helpful and answered any questions we had. Beware that the parking is $32 a day. Although that may be typical for downtown parking but I was under the impression it was $16 a day so it was a shock when we checked out. We were traveling with our 4 month old baby so we did not eat in the hotel restaurants. The Westin gym was excellent with t.v.s on all cardio equipment. The pool and hot tub in the north tower are very nice. I would recommend this hotel. The Westin does not disappoint.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11568389">I have stayed at the property fairly regularly over the last six months. Generally speaking, nice hotel, great concierge service and the location is solid. HOWEVER, if you end up staying in Seattle on a windy night like I had (14 MPH winds, gusts up to 20 MPH), do not expect to get much sleep. As mentioned in previous posts, the window seals, a few interior walls and other components of the structure creek LOUDLY in the rooms in wind conditions. I have stayed in both towers (12th North and 18th South) in these type of wind conditions and it is a general problem for the whole building. I observed other individuals complain directly to the front desk at 2, 3 and 4 in the morning. Overall, good hotel, but if you stay, you take the risk of getting a windy night and then you will have a much different opinion on what is important to you in a hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11099832">I have stayed at this hotel for 6 weeks while on assignment in Seattle. This is one of the few decent hotels in downtown Seattle, and trust me I travel all the time. The location is unbeatable - close to everything. Try and get a high floor. I always got the Sound/Lake view and the view is great. The hotel has a nice gym. I only got room service twice - it was excellent one time and dreadful the other. I did like to 5th Ave Cafe for breakfast, and you can get breakfast to go. What I like about the Westins is that they are the same everywhere, so you always know what to expect. If you ever stayed at a Westin, you know what you are getting. I dont know what other reviews complain so much about. I find it the only adequate place to stay. Renaissance is simply dreadful located right on highway, Sheratons are never as nice as Westins, W was ok, but rather pretentious and they dont work hard too make you happy (often times i felt like they simply dont care) plus the fitness facility is absolutely awful. The only nicer option is the Fairmont Olympic, but its way more expensive and does not have a good rewards program. So I give this 4 out of 5. If I am back in Seattle, I will stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR11025232">I was in Seattle for work and was booked into The Westin Seattle.

The common areas were dirty and unkempt. The room was nice and stylish but a lamp did not work.

What I experienced on the second stay has forced me turn my back and I never again plan to rest my head at this Westin. The issue--structural age of the two towers built in 1982 and interior age of the rooms no longer make it a viable option for the going rate (min $240 USD). On Nov, 11th and 12th the Northwest U.S. and Canada experienced the strongest windstorms of 2007. I acknowledge that I may be writing this review in bad timing since I was present on the 21st floor of the N tower during those two days. Either way, many guests-including myself-experienced a long restless night of a creaking wood structure and wind whistling through poorly sealed windows. Many reviews of this hotel note the same point--the age of the towers, rooms and amenities should be addressed and I'm certain that Westin will either invest in a major structural retrofitting or sell the property to avoid a much needed upgrading. The Westin Workout room by the pool is small and is comprised of 3 bike machines and a Core workout ball.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10506068">Stayed only 1 night for a work related trip. Nice view of downtown Seattle from my room, but I found that it was a bit expensive (225$ per night) for a room that will definitely need a decoration refreshment. For that price you are travelling back in time right to the 1990's especially in the bathroom who really needs some refit.

We booked a high level room in the Norh Tower which justified the price and we would recommend - the views are terrific both by day and night. Room was very comfortable and clean and the beds are fantastic. Service was ok but not particularly personal - something we accept from a busy and probably mainly business orientated hotel (don't stay here if a steady stream of conference delegates would bother you).

Our only problem was with the front desk, which didn't want to recognize our breakfast deal - lucky I had my email confirmation. Also, after the trip was over, Starwood points were never credited to my account, and they definitely had my starwood #. I had to argue with Starwood and hotel manager for my points!

We were quite wrong. This hotel is well below what I expect from a Westin. I'm not a normal complainer but at almost $300 a night you expect certain things, cleanliness being one of them. While the hotel is in a good location we had the following problems with the hotel. The white bed sheets has stains on them, the floors were dirty, the maids don't seem to vacuum the floors, the service was very slow. I had dropped some crumbs on the floor in the morning and figured it would get cleaned up by the maid when we got back at the end of the day. Not so. We got some wine to celebrate one night and called down for a corkscrew. We got it, 1.5 hours later. The last annoyance was the lack of a free internet kiosk. I know I should have brought my laptop but do you have to nickel and dime me at $12 an hour just to check my emails? This Westin is in trouble because there are plenty of other options for hotels in that price range. I certainly won't be back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8841697">I stayed at the Westin the week of 9/15/07. Here are some observations: Rooms: Extremely dated, stained carpets, old bathrooms with outdated fixtures and amenties - not nearly worth the almost $200 a night price tag. Even the once prized "Heavenly Bed" is nothing special at this time. Everyone including lower end hotels like Courtyard and Hyatt Place have better beds. "Heavenly Bath" is a joke. No-name, substandard bath products and tub/shower combinations abound. Old lighting, half of which didn't work, poorly placed TVs are standard. Low ceilings and "old hotel" scents are abundant. Service: Hotel staff were nice, but failed to deliver efficient, quality service. I had to call room service 3 times before recieving a cork screw. Check in staff were very good and eager to please. Food: I attended a meeting at this facility and the food was nasty. The eggs were runny at breakfast and the food was the typical "rubber chicken" type food that so many people speak of when they talk about conference food. Nothing worthy of praise in this arena including the dull meeting room, reminiscent of hospital waiting rooms. Safety: We had a high value item stolen from our group while we were at the hotel. Staff were pretty pathetic in there approach to resolving this situation. The best they did in an hour and a half was provide the non emergency number for Seattle Police Department. Overall, I am very disatisfied with this hotel. It is a few blocks off of an area that is safe and much more upscale. Stay at the Grand Hyatt or Sheraton. Avoid this very dated and underserviced property unless you pay under $100 per night. I have stayed at several other Westin hotels and this was the worst. This includes staying at the the dreaded LAX Westin in a Priceline.com room. Pitiful really.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8839650">My husband and I just returned from our trip to Seattle and truly enjoyed staying at the Westin.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8736928">I was in town on business and stayed at the Westin for just one night. I came in around 5 p.m. on Friday night and checked in without any problems. I was a little nervous because my room was right across from the elevators but once I got into my room and saw how big it was and the layout of the room, I knew I wouldn't be bothered by hallway noise. I was on the 38th floor and had a great view of downtown and the water. It really was gorgeous!! The room was really spacious with 2 queen beds, a desk and a little sitting area. After I checked in, I went down to the fitness room for a quick workout and found it to be really nicely equipped. There are a bunch of treadmills, a couple of cross trainers and a few bikes (all with individual tv screens attached) and a whole separate area with weight machines. The Westin is really centrally located so I took off to find dinner and found a bunch of places within a block or two of the hotel. It's also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macy's are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place. Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin! The Westin prides itself on its "Heavenly Beds" and I couldn't agree more with them. That bed was AWESOME!! I fell asleep fast and woke up feeling really well rested! Saturday morning I got up, worked out, and went looking for breakfast. Although there are a lot of coffee shops nearby, I decided to head to Pike Place Market and see what I could find there. Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk from the Westin and is definitely a must see. Try to get there early though, because this is tourist central and it really got crowded later in the day. I got there a little too early, as people were still setting up their stalls, but I have never seen such beautiful looking produce and flowers! And the seafood!!! It looked so fresh and delicious! I went back to the Westin to pack up and check out. Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room. When I was ready to leave for the airport, I just went to the front and the Downtown Airporter bus pulled right up and took me to the airport for just $10.25 ($17 roundtrip)! Definitely the way to go if you're staying here! I really recommend the Westin. It's a little on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8720491">It's now a hour past check in time and the front desk can only say our room isn't ready yet. We've been sitting here in the lobby of the hotel for about an hour and a half now. Don't make plans for the day of check in or they will be ruined by the horrible service of the Westin. The front desk will ask you for your cell phone number and then they say they will call you back as soon as your room becomes available. Guess what, you will get your call back after the front desk is done servicing everyone that is standing in line at the check-in counter. The line at the check-in counter is really long because the hotel can't seem to get people their rooms at the time designated, so everyone is standing in line trying to get a room over and over again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8664359">We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in July and it was perfect. We booked it on [--] for 279/night, which i believe was worth it. The room was comfortable, clean, and has all the Westin trademarks, heavenly beds, heavenly bath, etc. the view from our room was awesome, since the hotel is round shaped, everyone will always have a great view of the city (unless you are on the lower floors). THE DOWNSIDE to this hotel is the parking fee. 40 dollars a DAY. it hurt, but we did not want to park our car across the street because we were on a road trip and had too much stuff in it (plus seattle is known to be high on the list for stolen cars). other than the parking, the hotel was in a great location, you can walk to the harbor, the market, shopping, absolutely great location. with the superior quality rooms, nice lobby, fast elevators, great service, i enjoyed the Westin Seattle!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8654475">Like most downtown hotels, one would expect to pay more than you should. In this case we tacked on a few more for the view. What we got was a view of a large office building next door. If I stood at the window, I could look at an angle and see the space needle. needless to say, not too impressed with the view. Service staff was friendly. I didn't like the fact that when I checked in, my luggage and golf clubs sat curbside unattended when they parked the car. luggage valet was not around and car valet said they will be ok (we have cameras. I don't think so. I guess they don't realize the value of a good set of golf clubs. Overall, not bad, but had better views in cheaper rooms<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8515166">We stayed at two different hotels this trip, the Edgewater and the Westin. The Westin was about half the price of the Edgewater. When comparing the two I would definitely choose the Westin over the Edgewater. The Westin had a good location within walking distance to Pikes market and other shopping malls and eateries. The rooms were very large (especially compared to the Edgewater) which was nice since we had our 1 year-old with us exploring everything in the space. It was clean and comfortable and had a good view. The only drawback was the noise. It seems poorly insulated for noise. You hear everything out on the streets (ambulances) and in the hallways. Luckily the way the hotel is set up there are not many rooms on each floor. But it is circular around the elevators so everyone probably hears the elevators noises. We could hear our neighbors like they were in the room with us. To help we put a blanket below the door to the hallway and the door to our neighbors. This helped tremendously. We would stay here again despite the noise (we are heavy sleepers). The staff was also very friendly to us.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8509001">Great location. Staff was accomodating. Free upgrade upon check-in (per the front dest staff). Asked us if it was ok to be in a wheelchair accessible room - we said yes, not being in one before. Did not care for bathroom - water pressure was low in 36th floor room. Asked to change the next morning - switched to 34th floor room without any hassles. Stayed for 3 nights - enjoyed our stay. The concierge staff was extremely helpful - provided maps of city, restaurant suggestions, and Mt. Rainier tips. They definitely improved our trip. Only downside is a small indoor pool on 5th floor - did not use it or the hot tub. Exercise rooms (2) looked adequate w/ new appearing equipment. Lobby was stylish. Parking is pricey in Seattle and was also pricey at the hotel - $36/day for valet.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8505777">The Westin Seattle is a great location when you want to be near all the action like Pike Market and shopping, it's really centralized. Hop on the monorail and you'll be at the city center, space needle, the emp. The hotel itself is nice, friendly concierge, smiley staff, and good room service. However I didn't consider this as a 4-star hotel. The room is clean, however is a bit dated like the carpet. Most of the surfaces are just ok, but dusty. The bathroom is not top notch, some stains on the shower curtain, and the molding of the room are fraying. We had a room on the 34th floor with a nice view. If you are into feng shui, like I was, you would find the layout of the room to be kind of strange. The bed is at a diagonal, so that seems off to me somehow. I had a nice stay but the W Seattle is better. If this Westin is 4 star, then the W Seattle should be 5, and it's not that either. I give this hotel 3.5 stars at best.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8458990">Cold pool and expensive parking put a damper on our recent 3 night stay. Staff was nice.

Location is fantastic for access to monorail to Seattle Center and Westlake food court across the street. Can walk to water/Pikes place market and then taxi back if kids are tired. Cafe in lobby with hot and cold breakfast which we took out to room and had breakfast in bed. Kids loved this hotel and enjoyed the pool even though it is small and more for exercise.

The hotel met all of my expectations and I would highly recommend the Westin for anyone who is looking for a high-end, brand-name hotel in a central Seattle location. The Westin is mere blocks away from all of Seattle's finest restaurants, shops and tourist destinations such as Pike Place Market. You will not need your car because you can walk just about anywhere. My group requested a single room for 4 ladies to share and we were extremely comfortable in a basic King Size Room. The room comes with a King Bed, Sofa-Bed and a Rollaway (when requested). The front desk and concierge were always willing to accommodate and answer questions. Overall it was an amazing weekend and staying at the Westin was a positive experience. ** Fun Tip: If you stay at the Westin Seattle be sure to visit the Dahlia Bakery which is adjacent to Dahlia Lounge.

Choosing a centrally located hotel was essential, so we ended up at the Westin. The views were very nice. The room was satisfactory. The staff was courteous. Now, the irritating: why, after paying $250/night would an hotel have the gaul to to charge to park in their lot? When asked this question, staff looked as though they were sympathetic, yet powerless. With this experience, I conclude that "nice" hotels can charge for image. So, if you don't mind staying somewhere where the walls are rice-paper thin, the food terribly over-priced and a staff of attentive drones, give the Westin your business. But heed my warning, "you can't polish a ____". However, if you want a stay where you are appreciated as a guest, where someone acknowledges that YOU COULD TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ANYWHERE, choose somewhere else. Posh Spice is in LA, not in the Westin Seattle (regardless of how they portray themselves).<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8118535">I don't know how we managed, but we got a bargain price at the Westin, and loved it!

Right in the heart of Seattle, and you can walk to all sorts of fun destinations.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7960275">In many ways, this is a standard Westin hotel -- very comfortable bed, all the standard amenities, etc... It is, however, badly let down by two features. One is poor service. For example, if you drive up to the hotel following a GPS device's direction, you get to an entrance where there is no parking and no space to drop passengers off. When I rang the hotel to ask where I should park, they said "oh, yeah. We get this all the time from people who use a GPS system" before redirecting me to a different entrance. But the instructions were not on the website, and not in any of the emails that they sent to me welcoming me to the hotel. However, the bigger problem is the grasping nature of the hotel. I stay in probably a couple of hotels a week, many of them Westins, and have *NEVER* come across a charge for receving courier packages at a hotel before. To add insult to injury, when the package was delivered to the room, the bellboy refused to leave until he got a tip. This sullied an otherwise adequate hotel.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7714732">We went to Seattle for Memorial Day Weekend. We checked in on Friday and checked out on Sunday afternoon. The lobby is great! Upon entering our room, we noticed that the bellmen forgot to bring up my daughters bag so we had to wait around for them to find the bag and bring it up. We had 2 rooms, both rooms were nice upon first glance. Both rooms had stained carpets. Our room was the worst of them. the desk table was chipped on the legs, it had a power strip taped to the side of it. The lamps and lamp shades on all of the tables were crooked and loose (I fixed them). the couch had huge white stains on them. The dressers were dirty. The headboard was dusty. The couch and chair had rips in them and the strings were still attached. The bathroom mirror was dirty, and the framing was off as well as when they stained the wood frame, they got some on the mirror and didn't even bother to fix it. There was a few long hairs in the bed and on the bathroom floor and in the bathroom there was brown spots on the ceiling that has never been wiped off. I travel quite often for work and have stayed in several 4 &amp; 5 star hotels and I would not consider this a 4 or 5 star hotel. What you are paying for is the name...The best part of it all was I needed to use the restroom after walking back from the waterfront. I went into the lobby restroom and the urinals were yellow (no one bothered to flush, but on top of that, they were stained) so apparently it happens frequently. There were 6 stalls, 3 were being used, and the other 3 were overflowing with toilet paper and one of them was a red color. I informed the front desk clerk and she said oh really? I am sorry and that was it. I don't even know if or when she called maintenance or housekeeping but apparently they do not monitor their property (and this was a busy weekend mind you). Our first night was horrible. We went to bed about 9:30 pm. I was awaken several times between 10 pm and 12:30 am due to a party going on 2 doors down from us. We could hear the music clearly and then people coming and going and the door slamming shut, people having conversations in the hallway on the telephone inviting their other friends, swearing and drunkenness. I finally called the front desk to complain. They arrived about 20 minutes later and told the person in charge to be quiet or they were going to be removed. Finally, I got some sleep. I was not and am not overly impressed with this property and I will not stay there again. When we complained to the front desk clerk that checked us in, he did send up a bottle of champagne and a fruit basket for my daughter (it was her birthday) in addition to that, they signed a card and sent up a piece of cake. Aside from the friendly staff, there was not much about the hotel I would recommend to anyone. The GM, owners, and management company should be ashamed of themselves.

But the beds were comfortable and clean and full of pillows!! My 4 year old son found a pill on the floor of the room and brought it to me. Thank goodness he knew what to do and didnt try to eat it!! We mentioned it to the staff upon check out. The hotel clerk was clearly upset and very apologetic. When I also mentioned that our in room coffee machine didnt work - he bought us coffee and some milk for the kids. They probably should have done more since I think the pill thing was a HUGE problem.

I was torn when booking a room at the Westin Seattle. Reviews of this hotel are mixed, but I relied on past Wesin-stays and thought that I'd give this one a shot. What a disappointment. I transferred to the W Seattle after the first night. Pro's: Location: Walking distance to everything downtown Seattle has to offer! Views: The higher the room, the better the view. My room looked out to the Space Needle and over the water! Bed: Westin's 'Heavenly Beds', as always, live up to their name. Front-Desk Staff: Very welcoming and courteous. Coldwater Bar &amp; Grill (Food): Very yummy Con's: Public Spaces: Generally uninspiring Rooms/Hotel in General: Though recently undergoing renovations, this hotel shows its age everywhere. The room had stained/torn carpets. Bathroom was drab and moldy. Hardware and furniture are worn and tired. Room Service: Overpriced (like most 4 star hotels) and unfriendly room service attendants Coldwater Bar &amp; Grill (Staff): Honestly? They scared me. Our servers were older, poorly groomed, and overbearing. One of them stood against the wall opposite the tables in our section and watched us (and others) as we ate... I'm sorry, but that's creepy.

The next day we had to pack up and leave our bags to be moved while we were sightseeing, and did get a room with two beds. The rooms were dusty and not oversized. On the upside, the views were nice.

So, I was looking forward to coming back for a four-night stay, but this hotel has definitely gone downhill. Check-in was chaotic - it reminded me of airport lines I've faced in Third World countries. The clerks were pleasant enough but seemed inexperienced and overwhelmed. My room wasn't ready yet, so I left my luggage with the bell staff, who gave me claim checks and said they'd move my luggage to a secure area right away. When I came back three hours later, my luggage was still sitting out in the open lobby area - free for the taking by any dishonest soul. But I wasn't alone - there were at least a couple dozen suitcases left unattended near the check-in desks. I had a standard guest room with a king-size bed; it was spacious enough, and the bed was quite comfortable. However, the bathroom had not been properly cleaned, so I had to call Housekeeping to give it a proper cleaning. To their credit, they responded promptly, but didn't quite know what to do when they arrived. I had to point out, for example, that they should remove a half-used bar of soap left by the previous guest. Even after the daily cleanings, my bathroom had a vaguely mildewy smell. The TV had a very limited number of channels compared to Marriott and Sheraton hotels I've recently stayed at on business. I tried to order room-service breakfast one morning, but gave up after (twice) letting the phone ring for 12-15 rings and receiving no reply. The concierge desk wasn't helpful or knowledgeable about restaurants or bus routes. These things didn't add up to an awful or disastrous stay, just an unsatisfactory one. If this had been a budget hotel, some of the shortcomings would be more acceptable. When I'm next in Seattle on business, I'll definitely stay elsewhere.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6501062">We had stayed at this property before but after this stay, never again. I booked our room and inlaw rooms using the hotel web page. Our reservations said king with pull out, their copy of the reservation said 2 double beds. No one seem to take the difference seriously until I got home and emailed them a copy of the reservation. On arrival we tipped the bellman to have our bags brought to our rooms. 3 hours later we found our bags and our inlaws bags sitting outside the hotel and had to bring them up ourselves. We were on the 9th floor and on Sunday morning we tried to go down the elevators to have breakfast. We were there 20 minutes and watched elevator after elevator opened that was full. We finally put my inlaws on an elevator going up to get down to the lobby. We decided to take the stairs. Well there is no way to get to the lobby using the stairs. It goes to a alarmed door that goes outside so we had to walk up to the 6th floor and take an elevator up the 37 floors to get down to the lobby. Simple hiring elevator doormen during this peek hours could help with this nightmare. The room was awefully hot and wouldn't cool off even though it was December The biggest gripe is that they tried to get money out of you every time your turned around. They had a bottle of water in the room with a $5.50 price tag on it!! There was a coffee cart in the lobby but to use it you had to pay $2.50 for a cup. The kids did get a kick out of the $8.00 jelly beans that was sitting out in our room for purchase. For an old hotel, with poor service, and poor rooms, couldn't they at least not charge $5.50 for a bottle of water! I didn't even see that in NY city! We will choice another place next time.

We were given a room in the south tower on the 39th floor. Thankfully, we were on the opposite side from the street constuction going on near 6th Ave., although we did occasionally hear noise from the workmen--even up that high! Note: if you happen to get a room above the construction, insist on something better. As a travel agent, I'm always on the lookout for properties to which I would send clients. Can't say that the Westin has our full endorsement. The carpet in our room was stained, and there were a couple of mix-ups on our bill (which were straightened out upon request.) Didn't eat at the hotel -- seemed way overpriced for what you got, and there are plenty of other options in Seattle. Great location -- within walking distance of just about everywhere you'd want to visit. I used the bus system a couple of times, and found most of the drivers polite and helpful. Workout areas and pool were fairly nice, although located in the north tower -- for those of us in the south, it was a bit of a hike. Doormen and the rest of the staff were pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you can get a great deal on the price, and need to stay downtown, I'd go with it. Not necessarily worth the $185 or more they're asking. But it is in Seattle, and most hotels there seem to think they can charge higher than average prices. They do need to spruce up the place a bit, and practice a bit on the "personal touch" that Westin should exhibit.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6031901">Stay at Westin in Seattle was okay.

I had breakfast in the casual eatery each morning and found it to be overpriced...a egg mcmuffin style sandwich and a bottle of water ran $13. Room service was even pricier, the one meal I ordered was bland and tasteless and ended up costing $42. The worst part about my stay was while I was waiting for room service. I get a call telling me to open my door and when I do, I find another door has been closed, thereby locking my room and the room next to me off from the elevator vestibule and hallway. It was not just closed, but locked witha deadblot, and the top latch thrown, too. This caught me completely off guard and when I opened it the room service attendant could tell I was flustered. I asked who closed and locked that door and he was as dumbfounded as me.

I was not terribly impressed. The furnishings in the room were good, but the carpet was definitely old and stained. Room temperature control did not work well at all. Room Service menu was VERY limited and VERY expensive. There were few on site dining choices, although there are plenty in the surrounding area. I love luxury hotels, but to me this Westin did not seem so much luxurious as it was simply trying to extract money from you at every turn, while supplying very few of the amenities that would make the extra money worth it. It was like paying Ritz-Carlton prices without the level of service and attention to detail that a Ritz or a JW Marriott delivers. If you are going to Seattle on business, find another hotel, there are plenty in the downtown area. If you are going for pleasure, either save your money and stay somewhere cheaper, as you will be walking the same areas, using the same downtown restaurants etc, or choose another luxury hotel that actually delivers.

This was the second time I have stayed here and there will not be a third! Stayed here a year or so ago. Met my needs for a quick overnight business trip but certainly nothing special. Booked the hotel again this August for family celebration. Stay was so bad that we checked out after first night. Problems galore, which management chose to ignore. My biggest problem, far and away, was that they assigned my mother to a non-smoking room which stunk of cigarette smoke. Yes, all the rooms are now non-smoking but that does not mean that the hotel went to any effort to cleanse the former smoking rooms. Management moved my mother to another room, but guess what? It stunk too. It took a third move (at midnight) to finally resolve the matter. Lost in the shuffle was a northwest facing room (our primary reason for booking this hotel) and the connection to our own room (important b/c early-to-bed toddlers traveling along). Did management offer me a credit or refund? No. Did they adjust my rate to the non-view room rate? No. Did the apologize profusely? No, they didn't even attempt this most basic courtesy. Regardless, I have to say that even managment had handled my issues appropriately, there is no getting past the fact that you are paying a very full price to stay at a hotel that is many years past needing an update. Go elsewhere. We moved to the Edgewater and also spent some time at the Silver Cloud--Lake Union. You are getting your money's worth at these place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5814802">I just stayed 2 nights at the Westin Seattle (9/13-15). Had a great room on the 32nd floor, with a nice city view (I'm a Platinum Starwood member). My pet peeve with hotels is noise, so a connecting door to another room or excessive hallway noise is always a big downer for me. This was one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in. Possibly because my room was almost all the way around the tower from the elevator, but the lack of a long linear hallway seemed to make it very quiet. Loved the floor to ceiling windows (you need all the light you can get in Seattle). Bathroom was fairly average, with a pretty shallow tub (another pet peeve). The bed was angled diagonally into the room, and had a nice overbed light incorporated into the headboard with a dimmer switch. Nice touch, as I could actually read my book by this light (as opposed to the usual 40 watt bulb that is too dim to read by). You had to angle the TV over a bit to see it from the bed, which was a bit akward, but OK. The bed did not seem to be the typical Heavenly Bed mattress, it seemed much firmer, without the pillowtop mattress. It did have the Heavenly bedding sheets/comforter though. I was there for a meeting, and I must say the food we received in all the meeting rooms (breakfast, morning and afternoon snacks, and lunch), was terrific. Very healthy fare, and very tasty. I attend LOTS of business meetings in hotels, and the food at this Westin was some of the best I've had. The carpet in the elevator and hallways was a little worn and some stains, but this is a huge property that is obviously quite busy..... Staff were very accomodating....... all in all, a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend this Westin.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5800155">We stayed here from August 30th to the 1st of September prior to our Alaska cruise on the Mercury. After reading previous reviews, we were all pleasantly surprised with the hotel. The rooms were great, we had a view of the city, my Mother's view was of the city and the Space Needle. Everyone loved the beds and the rooms. Only ate breakfast in the hotel, and that was very good. The location made it ideal to walk to Pikes market, do some last minute shopping and also back down to the Pier to see the ship come in on Friday morning. Walked out to dinner as well to the Assaggio Ristorante, which was recommended by the concierge, it was excellent. (Just a hint, instead of a Taxi from the airport we took a Limo for the 4 of us for $ 35.00. They are parked at the same spot as the Taxi's, the lines are shorter and it was a great way to begin our vacation.)<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5784721">I have stayed at this Westin many, many times during the past decade. It has long been one of my favorite hotels, so my most recent experience was extremely disappointing. I should have worried at the outset - as I was met with hordes of airline crews upon my arrival - usually not a sign of a great hotel. In addition, the front door to the hotel off the taxi entrance was broken and resting askew like it had been hit by a car. Seemed dangerous to me, but no one from the hotel seemed concerned. I was greeted by a friendly desk person, but it soon became apparent that my reservation, made through the hotel toll-free reservation line, was seriously messed up. When a manager intervened, I was told that, sorry, but the room type you booked is not available, we are sold out, and we can give you what's left. So much for a loyal, multi-stay, gold status guest. Arriving at my room, in this now (thankfully) all non-smoking hotel, I was surprised to see an eight-foot smoke filter outside my room. Entering my room, I was greeting with the unmistakable scent of a smoking room. Guests be warned - even the now non-smoking hotels may find converting former smoking floors a challenge (hence the filter in the hallway.) I called the front desk to request a new room, and after several minutes on the phone the agent did come up with an alternative and said a bellman would be up within 15 minutes with a new key. After 45 minutes of waiting, trying not to disturb anything in the room I was moving out of, no bellman materialized so I called the desk again and asked for a manger. I was told there was no record of a room change being requested or made. To her credit, the manager recognized she had a very annoyed gold member on her hands and comped the room for the night. My tale of woe notwithstanding, I was really surprised by how the quality of this hotel seems to have slipped. I don't know if it's the heavy summer vacation/convention business or what, but the place was showing wear and lack of attention to upkeep. The towels were frayed and in a couple of cases had substances attached that made them unusable. There was no shower cap ammenity as you might expect and the bathroom just felt dirty. I could write my name in the dust on the headboard. The room felt tired - the Heavenly bed which was once so great even seems dated. My room service tray, left outside the door at 7pm, was still there at 9am the next day. Nonetheless, in the midst of this dismal stay there were bright spots. Room service was prompt and the food fresh and hot (when you're paying $27 for a burger - that's a good thing). The concierege was very, very good. All in all, I'm sorry to say that on my next trip to Seattle I'll be heading to the W or Fairmont. I'm sure the Westin won't miss me, but a part of me misses it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5776560">We stayed here for 5 nights as part of a four centre tour.

From the moment we stepped up to the check-in desk, the Westin Seattle FAILED on all of the above aspects (which are marketed...on the telephone, on their website, in the info. provided to expedia, etc.) Immediately after booking (7 weeks before our stay) and on the morning before arriving at the Westin Seattle, we called the Westin Seattle to ensure we would receive connecting rooms. We were told that 95% of the rooms connected, and it wouldnâ€™t be a problem. We were assigned rooms...several rooms apart from each other... on the 12th floor of at least 50 floors (the front desk insisted they had no record of our request for connecting roomsâ€¦) We entered our rooms to find: - missing bathrobes and one wineglass - VERY soiled carpet (see photo) - A very dirty and stinky bathroom that smelled of human stink COVERED with musky perfumeâ€¦very old folks home - A view of the middle of all surrounding office buildings After spending the night, we delivered our (many) complaints to management (who treated us like we were in 1st grade)... and were, after several hours, able to cancel the remainder of our reservation. We went to the Max Hotel (down a block)...and felt cared about. Basically, the Westin Seattle is conniving and sneaky in the way they represent their hotel. Photos online of the rooms and bathrooms are NOT of the actual, average guest hotel room and/or they have slyly hidden parts of the room in photos (see photos). For a 4 star, it may rank well for business conventionsâ€¦but itâ€™s not luxurious or clean, by any means. Honest.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5716188">This hotel was in a good location and was an average Westin: great beds, friendly service, no problems with front desk, valet, or housekeeping. In other words, everything you should expect from a hotel. But for the price, it's not that great. Add to your room rate a $31 valet charge and $10 internet access, and it adds up to be a rip off. I wish I'd stayed in a budget or moderately-priced hotel. It amazes me that a city like Seattle can get away with charging so much. Over-rated.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5625301">The Westin Seattle is a wonderful full service hotel right in the center of Seattle near most tourist sites. The view from our 20th floor room was great. The room was extremely quiet. The A/C system could barely be heard at all and street noise was almost non-existent. The room was quite large except for the bathroom. It was a little small as it is in the center of a round building. The only downside was the pool and hot tub area was full of screaming children when we tried to use it. Also, we were in the south tower and the pool was in the north tower which meant walking through the conference room areas in our robe. All in all, a great choice.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5624122">We tried to check in a 3pm and was told our rooms were not ready. We returned at 7pm and one room was still not ready. We asked for rooms on the same floor (5 people in 2 rooms) and we were given the 12th floor and the 18th floor. We were told because of the inconvenience we would have a sea view - both rooms looked over the City. We were booked for 3 nights, but after the first night, at 9.15am we had a phone call to say "when were we checking out" They had made a mistake with our booking. The corridors and general areas need modernising. The pool area consists of 5 sun lounges. For a hotel this size it is a disgrace. On the two occasions we went, people simply grab the 5 seats available and "hang on to them" One positive note. The Consierge is excellent. Good advice on where to eat, excellent recommendations on places to visit. I give them 10/10.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5620760">we stayed in this westin for a 4 day escape the first week in august. we had a room overlooking the water and it was breath taking. i had room sevice every morning because of that view. you need to see it to believe it. staff was great but forget about getting bellmen service since they never have anyone there. it seems that is not important area to them.we used the conciege a lot when we travel and this was one of the best before the trip and during. all their recomendations were right on. rooms were average but westin hotels have the best beds around. great location to tourist sites and taxi's are always ready out front. great time but i might be biased by that view.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5618027">Get out your Starwood member card here and request a Space Needle class view of the Puget Sound from the Space Needle to the Stadiums. This hotel has the best views in Seattle, it was no different than being in the Space Needle. My 42nd North Tower view ran from the Space Needle to the Downtown on the other side of the hotel. It was breathatking indeed. I strongly recommend paying the extra 20 dollars or so for the higher floor room. I am sure the view in the other direction over Lake Union must be excellent as well. But push for the Puget Sound View. At the time of my stay August 2006the Westin was about $100 cheaper than many of the other chain hotels in Seattle. So I really cant complain about the slightly tired room. It is a big convention hotel and, as is often the case, the room was worn. But the bed was great with good linen, the bath towels were ok. I could not help but notice that the "good" heavenly bath towel was rolled over the toilet tank with the label showing, the other "no label" smaller scratchier towels populated the rest of the bath. It was the usual excellent Westin shower. My room was large and had a sitting area with a couch and a chair. The pie shape made the room more interesting than a standard room. The floor to ceiling windows revealed a birds eye view. There were 5 elevators in the bay and I never had any trouble with may solo non-stop rides. The workout room was like a real gym with plenty of equipment. Check in and out, valet, housekeeping all functioned well. I had one mishap with my laundry which the hotel corrected and they did not charge me, which was a very nice touch from such a big place. The location is good, on the edge of Downtown, near the Market and Belltown. If they ever get the monorail fixed it stops nearby. I found the area to be a typical big city environment with all types. Nothing scary for anyone that has stayed in any large US downtown area. This is a Big Convention Hotel, not a boutique place. In my opinion it is better run than most Convention Hotel but there are too many rooms to keep the place perfect. If one wants a good deal, in a well run large hotel with best in class views (for those on the higher floors) this is it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5617496">We flew into Seatlle a day ahead of our scheduled Alaskan Cruise and were booked at the Westin by Princess Cruise Lines. Check in was courteous and quick. Our room was very clean and comfortable with a nice view on the 10th floor. We were with two other couples and the hotel put us all together on the same floor, rooms together. The beds are wonderful. My only complalint would be that there are no soda vending machines on the floors. We had breakfast the next morning at the hotel. Very good breakfast but our server could have been a bit more courteous. He acted very agravated when we asked for anything after the initial serving. One of the women found a long black hair under her pancake and asked for another plate of food. he bought another plate but acted very rude and offered no compensation.

The room was furnished nicely but in an impersonal way. The bed was comfortable, all westin beds are. Shower had some water pressure issues. Also getting an elevator in the tower was a challenge. I'd stay here again, but I think it's overpriced. There are smaller hotels with nicer accomodationd nearby for less price.

While down stairs around 12ish at night having a cigerette, the vallet and a local vagrent exchanged money for bottles of pills. When I told the security they didnt' seem very concerned. I recently had another issue at their hotel, they dented my car in vallet, and then the front desk person was so rude and flagerantly condisending, I didn't quite know what to say. When I lodged my complaint the manager made excuses and made it feel as though I was wrong in letting her know I was dissatisfied, and said that if they were unable to provide me with the level of service I require then maybe we shouldn't patron their hotel. She was right, the level of service I require is respect, and to be treated as if I just paid 500 dollars for a room in a hotel. If I wanted to see drug deals or have rude staff be condisending to me I would have stayed at the super 8 or the HO JO, but I didn't I chose to pay the extra money for a nice hotel experiance, unfortunatly I did not receive it from this hotel.

When I went to check in I was told the room with King/pullout couch was not available. The desk manager was helping me and he said that room types are only a request, not guaranteed. When I made the reservation, there was no mention of this only being a request. I had also called the hotel a couple days prior to confirm the room type and was told no problem. I was quite upset and explained to him that is the only reason we picked this hotel and there are many choices of hotels with 2 double beds and for less money. After realizing I was not going to let this drop, he typed and typed and finally said he had what I wanted. He then said â€œ I want you to realize that I am flipping someone out of their reservation for youâ€�. I told him obviously, they had already done that to me and this is contrary to him saying room types are not reserved. After assigning a room, I asked to confirm the price, it was incorrect. They were charging me $40 more than the confirmation I had in my hand. Because I had the confirmation, the price was lowered with no problems. After we were given our reserved room type and correct charge, all went smoothly. The hotel is in a great area for sight seeing and close to the pier.

I've just returned from a trip to Seattle less than 2 wks ago and we stayed at the Westin. In all honesty we had a great room with the most amazing view of the Space Needle and the mountains beyond. There were 3 of us in the room but we felt that there was plenty of space. The rooms was well appointed, decor was modern and up-to-date, the beds were incredibley comfortable, the bathroom was a good size and we found all the staff we encountered very firendly. One of my colleagues lost a camera and the hotel couldn't have been more helpful in assisting her to look for it and in the end they were able to furnish her with a report for her insurance without any problems. The lobby area is nice and big with plenty of seating space. We arrived late and were dealt with speedily and efficiently at reception. The concierge were very helpful with any of our requests for places to eat and how to get around. The hotel is in a great location cose to all the major areas in the city. There are plenty of good restaurants close by and shops plus the free bus around the centre of the city it a great bonus.

On the plus side was the location, the front desk staff around midnght when we checked in, and others in the lobby bar and the bellmen. This hotel is tired! We had a lovely view, but the first night we noticed a fishy odor and the carpet was wet and stained at the bathroom door. We coverd it with towels - it was late and all we wanted to do was sleep. We reported this the next morning and they would switch our room, but no view. We decided to stay having unpacked and just wanted it cleaned.. We left for the day and they never got to the room until late afternoon. The housekeeper had never been told. Went to desk again. We think maybe that day or the next they did try to clean it, but we kept a bath mat over the wet area. The staff just never took the time to just let us know if an attempt had been made to fix the problem. This was our first stay at a Westin and the bed was great and so was the shower.

One afternoon during my recent stay I took some work down to the lobby, to esacpe the monotomy of my room. After a time, two security guards came and surrounded my chair and asked me what I was doing there. Aside from wasting $250 a night, I couldn't really tell them. I fully understand that hotels have security issues, but this was ridiculous. I have been a guest at this hotel many times over the years, and am always well-dressed and well-groomed, but a single man is evidentially suspect in their view.

I didn't like having to go through the lobby and back up another elevator to get to the north tower where the pool is, but otherwise the pool was a great amenity.

The pool area was fairly nice, however hard to get to. The hotel also has a nice little cafe for morning juice and danish. The staff at the Westin were very courteous and helpful during our stay. The hotel is located right in the heart of downtown and makes it easy for tourists to see a lot and still be close to the hotel. We went to Pike Place Market and it was only about a 10 minute walk. We loved it, also don't let the prices fool you, you can always get a deal if you shop around.

At first i thought it was just our room, but upon checking the rooms of our other two friends....ours looked relatively "cleaner". They did not even have a fitted sheet on the mattress so the sheets kept riding up. But the major concern was the double sized beds which were too small for two people...so although my husband and i did sleep on the same bed, it wasn't the most comfortable way. Two good things that prevented me from screaming out of frusturation was the bathroom (nice showers, clean) and a great view (on the 34th floor). Three days before we came to Westin, we had stayed at Madison Rennaisance, and i have to admit i missed it terribly! It was much better, bigger, AND cleaner compared to the overpriced Westin.

The hotel lobby looks nice, has a restaurant and cafe that serve food that is overpriced and average. For good eating, you are better off discovering the many restaurants on Pike Street or Pine. Vons was one of my favorites. There is also a nice food court on the 4th floor of the Westlake Complex across the street where the monorail station is. I ate there often. The elevators are a bit scary, they shake and rattle and move quite fast. My room was on the 32nd floor, the Starwood Preferred Guest floor. The views from the room were excellent overlooking downtown Seattle and the bay. The corridors leading to the room are dark. The room itself has had some wear and tear. The "heavenly bed" that they have is comfortable, and there "heavenly shower" has a nice sprayer as well. I couldn't make a cup of coffee in my in-room coffee maker. The coffee machine smelled badly like it needed a proper cleaning. I just ended up buying my coffee at the many Starbucks in the area. The fitness center is a tight squeeze. Each piece of aerobic equipment had its own tv and they had complimentary headphones to use. The indoor pool was freezing, so I only stuck my big toe in there. The hot tub was nice, but full of kids when I was trying to relax. Beware the floor in the pool area, it's very slick. Overall the hotel was okay. I would have expected a bit nicer being a Westin, wear and tear type stuff and it seemed really dark inside. I was in town on business and the company paid the couple hundred dollar per night rate, so I didn't mind as much. For this hotel though, I wouldn't pay more than mid 100s to stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3722695">My husband and I stayed at the Westin in Seattle over the 4th of July weekend this year. I had made the reservation through the Starwood website because they had a promotion, stay two nights get the third for free. I read the reviews on this hotel so I wasn't expecting it to be perfect but since I got a good deal I figured I couldn't lose much. When we first checked in they told me they didn't have any king bed rooms available on a high floor like I had requested. This was a little upsetting because not only did I request a King size bed on a high floor at the time of the reservation, but I had also called a couple times a couple weeks in advance just to remind them. The guy at the check-in counter told me they had a room with a great view but double beds but if we wanted a king it would be on a lower floor. I asked if we could go see it first before deciding and he gave us a key to go look at it. The double beds were much too small if we wanted to sleep comfortable together for three nights so we took the key back down and told them we wanted a room with a king bed. I asked again if they were sure there wasnt any king rooms on a high floor. This time they had me wait about 10 minutes and then said they found one. I felt really happy and thanked the clerk for trying harder to find us a room. We went to our room and expected that they would send our bags up within 10 minutes or so (we requested they be delivered to our room when we valet parked). About a half hour went by and still no sign of our luggage. I called the "Service Hotline" from the room in the phone to find out what was going on. The lady was really helpful and said she would call me back. She called back about 20 minutes later and said that she couldnt get a hold of the front desk because they weren't answering the phone. By this time almost an hour had past since we got into our room so I decided to go back down to the lobby to talk to the front desk myself. I told the man that checked us in that we hadnt received our luggage yet and he said it would be up shortly. I went back to the room and got another call from the lady at the Service center and she asked me what our bags looked like, which was scary considering I would hope they have some sort of tracking system for the bags. Eventually the bags showed up about an hour and a half after we arrived in our room. We also had to cancel a dinner reservation becuase we didnt have our clothes to change into. While I am grateful we recieved our bags and they didnt get lost, It was upsetting that this would happen in a hotel like this. Apparently our bags had been put into the first room we looked at and were left there Other than the incident with the bags I didnt have much else to complain about. I wouldnt recommend the pool or spa, it was croweded with kids and indoors so it wasnt very relaxing. But if a pool isnt a big deal the hotel is in a great loaction. Also the hotel didnt smell very clean. We didnt eat at the restaurant so I cant really comment on that. The location and the view are definetely the best things about the Westin. The rooms are ok and the beds are comfortable. I would only stay here again if I got a really good deal, otherwise I think there are other better choices in Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3700354">We were only here for one night but thought the location and the bedroom were both great. We were on a high floor and had a great view. There was a coffeemaker with Starbucks coffee and the bed was tops in comfort. The location was great, walking distance to many sites. Would definitely stay there again. Liked Seattle a lot and the hotel as well.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3663892">i stayed at the seattle westin jun 25, 2005 the evening before boarding our princess cruise ship for an alaska sailing. the negative comments had me a bit concerned, but having worked in the travel industry for almost 25 years--well i've learned to take others comments with a grain of salt. we arrived at the hotel when it seemed like the entire 2 towers were filling up-or emptying out at the same time! however if you are a starwood gold or platinum member there is a dedicated check in 'room' where 2 efficient agents were checking people in. our wait was not more than 5 minutes. we were given a room on the 36th floor which had spectacular views of the bay! the room was clean, everything was well stocked and as usual the heavenly beds were so comfortable. too comfortable infact as we lay down for a short nap and woke up 3 hours later after a long morning of flying. the sunset we woke up to was amazing, with two cruise ships following each other out of the harbor----picture post card perfect! the only thing wrong with the room was that housekeeping had just cleaned the carpets and the solvents/detergents used had a horrible smell--that disipated though by the time we came back to the room from a short walk around town. i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friend and client. enjoy the views!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3634082">I've stayed at this hotel twice -- in September 2004 and June 2005. Most recently I arrived for a simple overnight on my way back from Melbourne, Australia. I'd been traveling for the better part of a day, Alaska Airlines had lost one of my bags, I arrived at the hotel tired and wanting a room. I share this by way of leading up to the major problem with this hotel. Arriving in the driveway, there was a ton of activity. No one was available to meet the cab or help with luggage (the ones that Alaska DIDN'T send to Reno). Dragged the bags inside and upstairs myself. Next comes the checkin area. It is seemingly ALWAYS busy. This is a huge hotel, and while there are several people at the front desk there's never enough for the volume they do. Fortunately there's a SPG Gold/Platinum checkin line in a separate 'room' at the far right, but even that had a line. Checkin agents here, both times I've stayed, have appeared to act like checking me in was a great chore, standing in the way of something they'd rather be doing. I've never gotten a terrific upgrade here, but have never had a problem getting a room with direct view of the water. The views here are wonderful. Continuing the theme of busy hotel staff -- too busy to help -- I asked about a bellman to assist with luggage and was told that I could wait (awhile) for one, but that I'd probably just want to take bags upstairs myself. I had a room view a great view of the water on a high floor, somewhere in the 30s. Heavenly bed is great as usual, better on this stay than when I was here in September (that time the bed seemed pretty worn, proibably close to needing replacement, and wasn't as comfortable as I've come to expect). Heavenly bath seems more or less limited to a shower curtain extending out into the bathroom to create the illusion of a bigger shower/tub. Room itself was a bit worn, scratches in the wallpaper and some stains in the bathroom. Upshot on the property is that the rooms are fine, views are nice esp. if you are facing the water, but it's very busy and geared towards conventions. I prefer the W and Sheraton.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3612412">My wife and I stayed at the Westin for 4 days starting June 18,2005. We enjoy walking when we visit. The Westin was close to shopping, Pike's Market and the Piers. The conceige recommended both Elliot's and the Crab Pot for crab and seafood dinners. Both were great. The Mariners are about 1 1/2 miles one way from the hotel and the Space Needle about another 1 1/2 miles the other way. The room was comfortable with a great view. We stayed on the 33rd floor south tower. My only complaint is that we requested extra pillows when we made the reservation. The front desk acknowledged our request and said the pillows were on the way up. They never arrived. We called the next day and it took only 10 minutes for the pillows to arrive. That said I would stay at the Westin again and would definitely recommend it to my friends.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3574949">Well, I'd been reading the reviews on this site, and I'd read some fairly negative ones, however I also work for a hotel so I don't always listen to what I read on review boards. After my stay with the Westin, I can honestly say that I will never stay with them again. They even offered me a free stay in the future to show that they can do better, but I'd rather go to a clean hotel. Here's my experience: First, we checked in at 4pm (checkin for the Westin is listed as 3pm). They did not have our room ready, they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes to half an hour. Both my boyfriend and I were fine with that. We said that was Ok, we would just get some food. Here's the first complaint... The hotel has 800+ rooms, 3 restaurants, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon not a single restaurant onsite was serving food. We found this odd, as they have 3, but we just went across the street. If you do stay at the Westin, the restaurant across the street ( something "grill") was excellent. We had dinner there, and talked to the bartender for a while, so we were in there for a little over an hour. When we went back to the Westin we were expecting our room to be ready. It was not. This is when we found it to be a bit ridiculous. We are from the Caribbean, so we had been traveling for approximately 24 hours to get to Seattle. Check-in is posted as 3pm, and now it is after 5 and there is no room for us. We tell the clerk that we would like to check in as soon as possible, we are going to sit right over at the bar (we pointed our where we would be sitting to him), and asked him to come and get us as soon as our room was ready. At 6pm we went back and low and behold, our room has been ready but no one came to get us. If this was the only problem. I would not be complaining. We get into the room and we were impressed. The view was great (view of Puget Sound). The bed was luxurious, as was the shower. That night we had a few things out of the mini-bar, and went to bed. The next morning we got up early, got showers, ironed our clothes and went out. Next complaint: When we came back to the room that afternoon. I was surprised to see that the maid hadn't been to our room yet. Upon walking in farther I saw that she had been in. The only thing that she did was make our bed. The maid did not empty the trash, tidy the room, fill the honors bar, or clean the bathroom. Clean the bathroom, and empty the trash!!! How ridiculous. The first day this happend we told the front desk, and when we came back up after dinner it was done. The very next day it happened again! 4 days and our room did not get cleaned, our trash did not get emptied, all that happened was our bed was made. On the final day the bed wasn't even made. We told the front desk about it, and nothing happened. My boyfriend and I are big honors-bar users. With the honors bar never being restocked I ended up buying my own water, and soda. (I did call down, but it was never refilled). On the final morning, after ignoring our room all week, we got up early, and underneath the door they'd slid our bill. This, to me, was just insult to injury. I'd been down to the front desk, and nothing had been done, no one had been up to refill the bar, etc. However, they did manage to find us to deliver us our bill. We did go down then and ask to speak with the manager. We told the manager that we were not looking for a discount, we knew what we would be spending on this vacation. But we would not be paying anything for the honors-bar, and we would not be paying for the drinks that we had at the bars, as those were had while we were waiting for people to clean our room, which they'd had all day to do. The manager, was extremely gracious, proffessional and apologetic. She absolutely agreed that we should not pay for those things, and she offered us a complimentary 4 night stay in the future to make up for this. I just can't see us ever wanting to go back there. I realize that this is all very negative, and some may read this and just think that I am overreacting, and that I did not handle myself properly. That is fine, but, as I said, both my boyfriend and I work for a caribbean resort. Things happen, we understand that, but the things that happened at this hotel were completely unacceptable. Finally a few nice things about the hotel: The concierge service was fantastic. We used them for dinner reservations, movie times &amp; tickets, shopping ideas, and a great daytime activity. I was very impressed, they were on top of things. The other great thing, was the location. As other reviews state, the location of the Westin is wonderful. It is centrally located to Pike Place Market, shopping, restaurants, movies. And it was nice because if we weren't quite sure were the hotel was we could look up and see it in the Skyline, and know where to go. We will definately be coming back to Seattle. We loved the city, and ate at some fabulous restaurants (Oceanaire for one), we also loved the activites that we did while in Seattle, we just will not stay at the Westin again. We've stayed at the Paramount hotel. The Paramount was a lot cleaner, more personal, and therefore nicer. Also, it was a whole lot less expensive.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3532902">ï»¿This property was all good . . . even the skywalk connected self parking from the north tower was a treat for a change at just $16.00!!

Walking distance to just about all of the major attractions. Rooms were newly redecorated, and offered a nice view of the bay from the 38th floor.

Overall, a very nice place to stay.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3303253">I stayed at the Westin in early March, 2005, and found it to be a functional business hotel... in other words, OK if someone else is paying the bill. The staff all seemed very nice, especially the front desk crew. Very accommodating and anxious to help. As mentioned in other reviews, though, this hotel is showing its age with worn, stained carpets in the halls and rooms. I liked the "Heavenly Beds" and showers... a nice Westin feature. Large, active, vibrant lobby area with couches and cushioned chairs... serving as a nice meeting place for many of the business travelers at the hotel. My main problem with this hotel was the exorbitant "side charges"... $29 per day plus tips for valet parking, $26 per day for self-park (!), and $16 per day for internet access when many hotels are offering it for free. Room service prices seemed extremely high to me, even before the fees and charges tacked on at the bottom of the page. Apparently they had just opened a new restaurant, but my room still had the menu from the previous restaurant, which caused some confusion when I called downstairs. After seeing the prices and limited selection, I opted for the McDonald's next door despite their resident panhandler. As with most places in downtown Seattle, the Westin is in a good central location within walking distance of major attractions like the Pike Place Market and the Convention Center.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3280598">A good option for business or leisure travellers. Good central location, excellent leisure facilities (gym and indoor pool); fantastic views of Puget Sound from some rooms. Not as "cool" as the W, but nonetheless the rooms are a decent size and smartly furnished. Service pretty good overall; food OK but could be better. New seafood restaurant lacked atmosphere and service was rather overbearing.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3272000">Not sure what everyone else is complaining about, I suppose you never hear good, just the bad about hotels... We stayed at the Westin Seattle for the weekend pretty much without any problems. Our room was on the 35th floor in the South tower and had an excellent view of the city. The check in was very fast and same with the valet service, so no problems there. Staff was courteous and friendly, despite the overwhelming amount of traffic within the hotel due to an auction that was held this weekend. No problems whatsoever.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3163914">We checked into this hotel in November. I should have written this review earlier, but here goes. We orginally selected this hotel because our good friends had stayed here previously. We confirmed our check in about at about 4:00 P.M because we didn't plan to arrive until about 6:30. When we arrived it was an absolute zoo at the valet parking. In fairness there was a function from the University. In any event we left our car and were told the bags would be brought up to our room. Check was reasonably quick. The fellow at the front counter was quite young, about the age of my son. Just to make small talk, I asked how long he had been with the hotel. He snapped back, "Why do you ask". I guess he thought I was complaining because he looked a little tired and I said, I was just wondering how you liked working here. I think he then realized I was just trying to make conversation. He gave us our keys and pointed to the elevator. We arrived at the 7th. floor and were hit with a waft of stale smokey air. The carpets looked beat and were stained. Food trays were outside of two doors and it looked like they had been there awhile. We we opened the door to the room the smell was even worse. Being cheap travellers from Canada, I remarked to my wife, "I guess this is what $165 US gets you". We looked at the carpets and they were gross. I would not even feel comfortable taking my shoes off. We decided the smell was too strong and the room was obviously for smokers, which we were not. We went back down to front desk and were greated by what appeared to be a more senior person. We were very polite with our complaint and he apologized and gave us keys for another room on the 11th. floor. When we arrived the carpets were marginally better. We opened the door to the room. Nice view of another tower and no smell. I guess this is what we will get. I looked at the desk in the room and it appeared someone had sat down and poured themself a drink and there was ice that had melted in the bucket. It looked like someone had already checked into this room. I looked in the closet expecting to find someone's clothes. I then went into the bathroom and there was a bag underneath the vanity and someone had used the toilet and it had not been flushed. This was awful! Back down to the front desk. We said that we really don't like to complain, and told them that we though the room had already been checked into. My wife asked about the possiblity of an upgrade. The gave us another key and directed us to the other tower. We were given a room on the 46th. floor. A really nice suite with a great view of the space needle and Elliot Bay. There was a robe on the bed and one in closet. It looked like the robe on the bed has been worn the way it was thrown on the bed. Then I looked at the side table and thought it was nice to see the evening paper only to discover it had already been read and looked like it had been pulled out of the garbage can. In the shower in the bathroom, there were empty, used open shampoo and conditioner bottles just left in the shower. We thought, at least they have made good and we were satisfied................... That was until we got home from a nice dinner around midnight. The bed had been turned down, but as my wife climbed into bed and adjusted the pillow she notice it had blood on it. This was really gross. We just threw the pillow on the floor and used the remaining two. Funny, a couple of weeks later we had our good friends over and related the story to them. They then told us that they haven't stayed at the Westin for years because it had really gone downhill. I would have given a terrible rating, but since we were upgraded they did try.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3005589">What a wonderful stay we had at the Westin shortly after the New Year. Our room had a gorgeous view of Puget Sound and we ere lucky to have some sunny weather with which to enjoy it. The hotel was well located for the shopping and dining amenities of downtown Seattle. Our room was lovely, the bed was piece de resistance with its Heavenly Bed, I haven't slept so well in ages. The bathroom was in need of updating as it was small and not well-lit, the only let down in the room. The lobby was beautifully appointed and the staff were very helpful. My husband went the gym while we there at the hotel and was duly impressed with the quality of the facility. We would not hesitate to stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2867014">Once upon a time, when this was the flagship Westin (the corporate headquarters were just across the street) this was a classy, cool hotel: It had a excellent dining room, a coffee shop, two bars (one a Trader Vics!) and a full-service health club. Now everything about this place seems to be "on the cheap": no nice dining room, a banal "cafe" for breakfast, only one vapid bar (and that's in the lobby - very airport-ish), and a dirty workout space with no good locker facilities or even attendants. The good thing about this hotel is the views: The guest rooms definitely have the best views in town. But the furnishings are tired and worn. It's OK for conventions, if you get a good rate, but it really is just a ghost of its former self.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2860819">You cannot beat the location, not our first stay.

I booked through expedia and liked the pictures...very deceiving. The interior is not very nice to start and my whole experience ended up a nightmare. Initially, I wanted to check-in early which, when I called from the airport, was told would not be a problem. Got to the hotel and one of the towers was closed to to a pipe bursting. Ok, not their fault. So I wandered around for a couple hours and came back. Checked in (after a long wait with many other disgruntled travelers) and got to my room which I found did not have a working television, just snow. I called the front desk and was told there was no estimated time that it would be working if at all during my stay. I decided to give it a couple hours and went out. When I got back at midnight it was working. The next morning I ordered a "healthy" room service breakfast and ended up with yogurt that had already expired. To top it off the staff was lazy and not helpful. Instead of being appreciative and apologetic, I had to prompt them to fix things that went wrong, like "can I get another yogurt"? After a discussion and much prodding, I was promised a room credit for one night which I have never receieved, even after I asked about it at check-out. I was told I would have to speak to the person who had promised it to me who wasn't there instead of just having the credit on my bill. After I was home I was just happy to be away from that horrible hotel. Honestly, I think a Motel 6 or Best Western would have been cleaner and more comfortable. Not only will I NEVER stay at the Westin Seattle, but I will NEVER stay at ANY Westin hotels this experience was so bad.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2814379">My stay at the Westin Seattle had some high points and some low points. I think that reading this review can help you avoid some of the low points we experienced. When booking this hotel I heard many great things about the view. Well, our room had a great view... of the other tower. Because the two hotel towers are so close to each other, we didn't see much of the city. That was disapointing. The lobby and bedroom decor really was bland and dated. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member who has stayed at many Westin and Sheraton hotels, and the look of this place really wasn't up to par. On other reviews, people say that they received a room that was recently renovated. That may be the case, but keep in mind that the majority of rooms appear not to have been. And with a view directly into the other tower's rooms, I could see the exact same bland decor duplicated ad nauseum. That was disappointing The "heavenly bed" that Westin is known for is used at this hotel. However, our King size mattress had a lump down the middle. The next morning, when I awoke with a back ache, I took a closer look. I discovered that it was two smaller "heavenly beds" bolted together to make a king size matress. That was disapointing. Because the hotel towers are circular, each room has an odd wedge shape, much like slices of a pie. This makes for unusual placement of furniture. For example, our tv was not directly in front of the bed, but to our extreme left. That was disapointing. Despite all of our issues, there were two things which went very well for us there. First, the location CAN NOT BE BEAT! The hotel is right in the middle of everything. Second, the concierge was excellent. I asked them to recommend a romantic restaurant for my wife and I. They made us a reservation for a restaurant called "The Pallisades." Because it would be a bit of a trip, he arranged a ride for us. When we showed up in the lobby later that evening for our "ride", a stretch limo was waiting for us. WOW!!!!! The restaurant, by the way, was all that he said it would be. And when we were done, the limo gave us a ride back to the hotel. The limo ride was completely free of charge, complements of the Westin. All of this being said, you can probably get a good room at the Westin if, upon check in, you request a recently renovated room, that it does not have two beds bolted together to make a king size bed, and that does not directly face the other tower. Also, don't be afraid to use the concierge. Our experience with that alone made up for everything else!!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2798688">First of all, the Seattle Westin is abjectly mediocre. And completely bland. And not as clean as it should be for a pre-paid 170 bucks a night. At least my room wasn't. I really was not digging the hair in the bathroom and unidentified objects under the sofa at all, among other things. The interior designer (and I use that term loosely) seemed to be going for cheesy '80's Roman-Greco, complete with plastic (yes, plastic) urn. The furniture was pretty cheap-looking, as well. Okay, now the gross part: There was a coffeemaker in the room. There were packets of Starbucks coffee and those tiny containers of half &amp; half next to the coffeemaker. One might assume the half &amp; half would be fresh, right? Uh, wrong. I made some coffee and added three containers of half &amp; half which I proceeded to drink before I noticed the fourth container was actually open and full of mold. So apparently those containers had been sitting there for several days. Which made me wonder about the towels and the bedding. And the carpet and the toilet and the bathtub. To say that this hotel is not up to Westin standards is a huge understatement.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2571264">After reading all the very mixed reviews on this site about the Westin, I understandably had some fears about what I might expect upon arrival for the 3-day Seattle segment of my vacation last week. Thankfully, those fears were quite unfounded and I had a great time staying at the Westin. As suggested by another reviewer, I booked an (admittedly) pricey room just so I could experience the views of the city/Space Needle/Puget sound, and I was not disappointed. I actually arrived before check-in and though I had been booked into a room on the 31st floor which was not ready yet, the gracious front desk clerk upgraded me (as I was a SPG rewards member) to an enormous ... I mean enormous ... room on the 39th floor! Unfortunately, the bathroom didn't have a separate Heavenly Shower/soak tub like other Westins, but the sweeping wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling view and the huge living space more than made up for it (room was furnished with a king-size Heavenly bed as well as a double sleep sofa with plenty of room to spare.) The hotel's location could not be beat either ... within walking distance to all of Seattle's major attractions and neighborhoods. All in all, I can say that I was very pleased to have stayed at the Westin and will do so again the next time I'm in the Emerald City!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR2524122">Feeling nervous because of some negative comments here on TripAdvisor about the Westin Seattle, I went ahead and stayed there for 2 nights a couple of weeks ago and was very happy there. I had a newly renovated room with spectacular views, nice furnishings, the famous Westin "heavenly bed''--which IS very comfortable--and a wonderful bathroom. Maybe because I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest member and went to the special check-in area for SPG members, the desk clerk was very friendly and when I asked if the 41st floor room I'd been assigned in the North Tower had a water view--it didn't--she reassigned me to a 33rd floor room in the South Tower with a wonderful Puget Sound view. She asked if I'd mind being in an upgraded, recently renovated room (duh, no I didn't). The room had nice, new furniture and the usual Westin great bed and bath (with the cleverly designed rounded shower curtain that keeps the curtain--and possibly other people's germs-- away from one's body). My only minor complaint was that there was a FAINT smell of cigarettes (in spite of it being a non-smoking room and floor)--a common problem, I've found, at many hotels. But I saw a maid around the bend, asked her if she had room deodorizer, and she came right in and sprayed up a storm (maybe too much for our health!), and that pretty well killed the smell. I'm very sensitive to cigarette smells, by the way. I decided to buy a scented candle at the drugstore 1/2 a block away just for good measure, and the smoke smell was gone from then on. (I also bought bottled water there I could keep in the room's mini-bar to avoid the overpriced water the hotel made available.) I had worried about being kitty-corner from the elevator (since I usually ask to be away from the elevator and the ice machine), but since there are only about 10 rooms on each floor (because there are two tall and skinny towers at the Westin), it wasn't a problem. (Well, one night, some party-ers came back about 1:00 and were noisy in the hall for a few minutes, until another guest shushed them.) The other staff members I encountered--bell staff, concierge, etc.--were all very friendly and helpful. The concierge made us dinner reservations both nights, and arranged for us to get a complimentary appetizer at the famous Ray's Boathouse in Ballard. I'd stayed at this Westin once before, and had to switch rooms twice to get one that didn't smell like cigarettes and had a view--but even then, I wound up with a great room. I like the large desk by the window in the room--great place to look at the view, write, read, etc. The TV was new and had a great picture, and the lighting was better than at many hotels. The web access was too expensive for me to use--like $16/day--and I tried to avoid making local calls--for $1.75. (There are pay phones downstairs.) But almost all big-city hotels nickel and dime you to death this way. I was traveling with a friend who'd booked the Warwick Hotel, which was a little cheaper, and she was miserable there (busy street with lots of traffic noise in the room, unappealing decor, unfriendly staff, terrible view of parking lot, etc.). She moved to the Westin our second night in Seattle and was very happy there, too. In fact, the Westin gave her a very good deal for that last-minute reservation. (I got an amazing bargain since I used Starwood's "points and cash" program; but my friend's rate of $149 seemed very reasonable for such a great room in an expensive city in peak season.) All in all, I'd highly recommend the Westin for its rooms, decor, and staff. Maybe you need to be friendly with the desk staff for them to be friendly in return, or maybe it's just a matter of who you happen to be dealing with (as in the rest of life). I wouldn't let some of the reviews here scare you off. Also, given the height of the Westin buildings, you have a better chance of getting a quiet room on a high floor--and thus away from downtown Seattle traffic noise--here than in lots of other shorter hotels.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR124780106">The hotel is the bus stop for the Quick Shuttle from Vancouver and is a quick comfy 2 hour ride from South Surrey .. we did the hotel and then did a nice walkabout to the CBD too!!

I would not want to walk back to the hotel from downtown by myself at night. Pros: Price: less than 100 for Seattle is not bad Cleanliness: ok Location: 3 minute walk to space needle and Jimmy Hendryx museum (recommended!), 15 minute walk to shopping part of downtown, 30 minute walk to Pikes market. Staff: pleasant Pool: It was closed in November but open in summer, call and check if this is important to you Hot tub: Did not try it but it is there Art: 2nd floor hallway art, lol. TV: yes Internet Access: Worked fine Breakfast: Stick with hard boiled egg, bread, fruit and yogurt and avoid the rest Cons: Bed: Super soft, full rather than queen sized, sagged in the middle Bathroom: Low rent 70s style meh Ambiance: None Room: Small, hole in carpet, giant loud HVAC.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119908418">Very convenient location near the Space Needle and EMP museum. Check-in was very quick. Elevator is a bit rusty and after you got of on the floor the hallways to the rooms were very hot. Hopefully your keycard works the first time ;) The room itself was ok and the beds were comfortable for the night. To bad that you are looking directly onto another hotel and have no view of the space needle. This is the right hotel if you are checking out Seattle all day and stay there only to sleep.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR119888915">This hotel is pretty low priced but be prepared for a couple of things. Firstly the staff are kind of strange. The first was so desperate for conversation she wouldn't let me go to my room, the second tried to convert me to their own political ideology and would direct me to the nearest Starbucks as they were too corporate. The third wouldn't even raise their head to even acknowledge my existence. That coupled with the ancient decor and general dark feel of a prison with brown flaky walls made for a very interesting stay. Not horrible but I wont be going back.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR119647600">This hotel is in the perfect location while staying in Seattle. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with in room coffee, plenty of fresh clean towels and a very nice breakfast with waffles, sausages and the usual continental spread. you can aslo get water and coffee in the lobby 24 hours. The pool area looked very nie with a nice view but we were there in late October so it was closed but the hot tub was open. There is free wifi. and two computers in the lobby and printers. You can walk to the needle and Monorail. Try Seeks Pizza and Sports Bar and Grill just around the corner. Pikes Market Place, Olympic Sculpture Park and the water front is also walkable if you are up to it. It is a pretty walk. But if not, take the monorail to West lake Center. I hope to return to Seattle and I will stay here.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118913795">We spent a weekend in Seattle after a week long convention in another city. I chose Travelodge strictly because of price. The hotel we had stay at on our previous visit was much nicer for the same price as Travelodge but because I waited until two weeks before our trip to book our room, the price jumped $60 a night so we had to make another choice. We arrived much later than we were supposed to due to Shuttle Express being over booked, even though we had reservations. Still, it is the least expensive way to get to the hotel from the airport. We were greeted by friendly hotel staff even late at night. We did not have a room with a Space Needle view but a view of the parking lot. The first thing I noticed when getting off the elevator was the musty smell, I assume from the carpet in the hall. After the first time walking down the hall, I guess I got used to the smell because I didn't seem to notice being as strong. The second thing I noticed was the dim lighting in the halls. The only light came from a few pot lights in the ceiling with a string of old looking track lights on cords strung between the pot lights. It was dark and a little scary, being that our room was the last one down the hallway. I figured it was dark due to it being night but the hallways seemed just as dark during the daytime, until you got to the area where there were windows facing Space Needle. The room we had was very small and seemed old. There was a small fridge in the corner and coffee maker. The bed was very comfortable and the linens were very nice. The kind you would expect in a high dollar hotel. It was fine for us since we weren't staying very long. More than two nights and the lack of space would have been a problem since there wasn't much room to move around. Bathroom was small, no tub but the shower was very roomy. We did not use the pool or spa but the pool seemed like a good size and looked very inviting. There was a BBQ in the pool area but not sure if that was for guests to use. They serve a complimentary breakfast, which is helpful since I didn't see any other places to eat that are close by, other than McDonalds a few blocks away. Breakfast consists of fruits, cereals, sausage, hard boiled eggs, muffins and donuts, waffles, toast and bagels. The room has limited seating but we seemed to be able to find a place quickly enough on both mornings. The ice machines are on every other floor. We had a vending machine located on our floor but I don't know if they are on every floor. Coffee is served in the lobby day and night. The hotel is very close to Space Needle, a couple of blocks away. You can also catch the Monorail there and can ride it downtown for $4 roundtrip. The Monorail stops at a mall, which is then about another four blocks from Pikes Place Market. The area is safe to walk around during the day. We stayed downtown until 10pm, riding the Monorail back and then walked back to the hotel. Not a lot of people walking on the streets that time of night. Nothing in the area but some Condo's and the McD's so it was a little spooky walking back to the hotel from Space Needle. Checking out on a Sunday morning can be a little hectic due to so many people waiting in the lobby for shuttles to take them to the pier for their cruises. For an overnight stay at a place that is close to sights, this hotel is fine.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR118778253">We arrived at a very late flight on September 17. The shift employee was courteous (sorry don't remember his name). He sent us to a room on the first floor, down the hall. When we entered the room, I was very dissapointed. Everything looked very old and poorly maintained. The carpet was very, very stained; even though only one of the lamps was on, we could spot all the stains. At first the only thing that looked clean was the bathroom; but when I got in the shower, there was mildew. In the morning we tried to get some sleep and the housekeeping girl kept trying to get in the room and it was only 7:30 am! My husband was very upset because she tried a couple of times. At the front desk the employee was very, very nice. He kept our bags while we went outside for breakfast. We did not want to risk eating there, because everything looked so dirty.

Good things: Off street parking (not secured), very efficient checking, AND one of the better free breakfast services for a hotel. I gotta chirp about the latter since I need a good breakfast. They have juice, coffee, and milk. They have free waffles. They had free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Wow,..since when do you get free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. They also had cereal, yogurt, and fruit. They also had a small pool which wasn't good for much more than taking a dip to get the grime off after running around Seattle. Note: the mention of a restaurant only pertains to their free breakfast area. Bad things: The carpets were a bit on the nasty side, especially in the hallways. They really need to replace them, though they're worn probably due to all the traffic. I think a lot of people stay here for the location to the primary Seattle attractions at the needle and center. Kind of a cheap shower (though hot) and bathroom area though the beds were comfy enough. All this said,..a bit over-priced, but I'd consider staying here again, mainly for the free SAUSAGES AND HARD BOILED EGGS. Good location to the bigger Seattle attractions including the various pier areas (great seafood,.yum yum), the monorail to downtown (i.e., stay here, take a monorail to the city center is pretty cheap), Pike's place (you have to see this area; yum yum sea food, all kinds of shops, tons of beautiful people, the original Starbucks).

It offered several types of coffee's which I hadn't seen before, and didn't expect in a hotel like the Travelodge. The beds were nice and the linens and pillows were comfortable.

The monorail is $4 round trip (runs until 11pm) and takes you to a mall that is about three blocks to the pikes place market. You could easily walk, but it is very convenient to have the monorail so close. The hotel was easy to find, has parking available for $10 a day, which is good in Seattle, free coffee/internet in the lobby, a large hot/cold continental breakfast (waffles,yogurt,cereal,fruit,bagels,muffins,juice etc when we stayed), and a pool/hot tub. Our room was small (King size bed, table/chair, love seat, TV, mini fridge all jammed in) but we didn't spend much time in it, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.

I work at a luxury hotel in Beaumont, Texas and know that this motel is great for a traveler's motel. When I was there I used the computer in the lobby and chatted with the night desk guy. I don't recall a name but he was very warm intellligent and friendly. The day desk ladies were most friendly. If I had to complain it would be that the water pressure was low but the shower was hot like I like it. Oh and there was a housekeeper guy that I chatted with and gave a radio to because i went shopping while in Seattle and bought a new cd/radio player. So to all the bad reviewers you need to be aware this place really has changed. Though being in downtown I saw absolutely no drug dealers or hookers like i read once before by sommeone. This Travel Lodge will definitely get another visit by me when i revisit the emerald city.

The room I'd reserved had been given away. I'd stopped for groceries, having reserved a room with a kitchenette. The manager, whose name I knew from my phone call, claimed in person I'd not reserved this type of room. I'd spoken to him two days prior, and had the reservation printout. He denied everything, including what was in black and white. He said that instead, I should use the microwave in "the breakfast room" during limited hours. They'd described it as a nice, relaxed dining room. It was a tiny, fluorescent lit square. Like eating in a public restroom. A nice clerk quietly told me my room had indeed, been given away. The room they tried to give me stunk of vomit and harsh disinfectant. There was no bathtub. The new, flesh-coloured paint was applied sloppily over decades of old paint. Though I arrived an hour past check in, they were doing repairs in the room. The repairman yelled at me for coming in. They had claimed on both their website and on the phone, that they had renovated and were offering a "limited time" low price. I have luck with sales, so I went for it. The renovations were minimal. The basic dinginess was still there, just covered with new but extremely cheap furnishings. E.g. the lobby smelled of sweat and fried food, but they'd put out searingly bright plastic flowers and a rug. As I was at the desk trying to get my credit card reimbursed, the repairman stomped past with his ladder and glared at me. I still don't know why. The one desk clerk was a very nice young man. I arrived excited to be attending a festival for the weekend. I tried a couple of other hotels, but they were full. I missed the festival, because I drove back to Canada as fast as I could. Missing my events was better than sleeping at the Travelodge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR51177435">This hotel is bad need of an update. The room was as clean as it could be, but the carpet was extremely old, so was the bathroom, and it was silly that the only curtains we could close were sheers, and we could see through them to the hotel behind us (I'm guessing ditto for those guests looking in to our room!). The staff were very nice, though, there is free internet in rooms and there is also a decent free continental breakfast (fruit, cereal, toast, waffles, hard boiled eggs, sausages, coffee, juice, tea). The gym was also decent for the hotel. Parking is $10 a night. Location is perfect - a block from the space needle and monorail, walking distance to downtown, and most importantly, to Top Pot Donuts (you MUST go here). Also only a few blocks away from an Airport Bus pick up (we walked about 5 minutes to get to it). You get what you pay for - we got a deal online, and since we were only there to sleep, it wasn't a big deal, but even for a Travelodge, it was not the nicest place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR47381722">We stayed here for two nights, just for a fun trip down to seattle. The location was great, just a three minute walk to the needle, emp, and monrail. We left our car parked the whole time and took the monorail, tunnel buses and walked. Staff were great, let us check in 2 hours early! We had an updated room, nice down comforter and pillows. Just the bathrooms weren't updated. Don't miss breakfast! definitley worth waking up for. Something to suit everyone, even fresh waffles! Would stay again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR39156335">Even though Travelodge Space Needle is inexpensive, I wouldn't stay here again. Serious noise problem due to the fact that it is in close proximity to city fire station. In the three nights I stayed here, the sirens went off 4 times in the middle of the night. Also lots of outdoor noise from outdoors late at night. Also, hotel is remote - you have to walk for blocks to get to a restaurant, and it is a three block walk to the monorail, which is the main method of getting downtown. Lack of cleanliness was apparent -- carpet was filthy - big stains. Front desk staff were not particularly helpful.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR38001307">This hotel has been recently refurbished and was better than we were expecting. It wasn't cheap but it was one of the cheapest we could find in central Seattle. The rooms are fairly standard - 2 queen beds, fridge, TV, small shower room etc. However, parking was cheaper than most other hotels I looked at and although they say it is limited, there is actually quite a lot. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle and the complimentary breakfast was more than adequate.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37364915">Having read some of the previous reviews of this Travelodge my wife and I approached it with some reservations. Our room had recently been refurbished and had the largest and most comfortable bed we had ever slept in, in hotels or at home! The reception staff were helpful and polite, and we didn't have to ask for the $10 parking permit. The complimentary breakfast was just fine. For all but Americans (who don't seem to like walking) the motel's position suited us perfectly. We walked into downtown in about 15 minutes (at no great pace), with another 5 - 10 minutes to Pike Place Market (depending on how many shop windows we looked in on the way). It was possible to walk to the waterfront of Lake Union in 10 minutes. There was a lot of building work in the vicinity of the motel, but this didn't give us a problem - any noise stopped at night. We would love to go back to Seattle, which we enjoyed very much, and would go staight back to this Travelodge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR32202056">I stayed here for 2 nights and the room and bathroom were clean but even earplugs couldn't drown the noise out of the doors to other rooms being slammed at all hours, plus the couple in the room next to me having a domestic dispute for hours and slamming things around! Air conditioners also very noisy, had to cool the room down first and then turn it off just to try and get some sleep. Breakfast is also pretty ordinary. Toast, pastries, cereal, waffles, sausages or boiled eggs. You get what you pay for I guess.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR30260599">As a youngster, staying at this Travelodge on family vacations was a real treat. I can still recall The Space Needle under construction during one of our visits. Flash foward to the present and this babyboomer checked in at the main desk of one of Seattle's venerable motor lodges. I was greeted by two smiling clerks. Informing them that my last stay was in 1979, I was given a Seattle street map to get me up to speed. Thanks again, guys. My compliments to the persons in charge of interior decor. Throughout the hotel, from the elevator entrances to the hallways, are framed prints of works from Salvador Dali and Jackson Pollock among other artists. My room was spotless and there were plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom, including a hairdryer. The bed was comfortable and not too soft, either. I would start my day with a complimentary USA Today and walk a few steps past the lobby to the buffet room with a free hot breakfast waiting. Their waffles are perfect and they know how to make a great cup of coffee, too. The only glitch throughout the whole stay was momentary when the toilet lever in my room suddenly wouldn't flush. I called the front desk and the courteous young man replied, "Ooooo, that's not good. Someone will be up in a few minutes to fix it." Within 5 minutes, there was the hotel plumber at my door with a smile on his face and the problem was solved. Housekeeping deserves applause, too, for their polite and cheery way they greet guests. Centrally located, this Travelodge is just a 10-15 min. walk to the heart of downtown. Taking the monorail cuts that timeframe in half. I took advantage of both modes of travel. At the end of the day, I looked forward to relaxing back in my room on the fourth floor.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR28512519">When we first got there it seemed like a decent place to stay, friendly gal at the front desk (I only saw her once). The beds were very comfortable for a hotel and we were having a peaceful rest until about 2:30 AM when we were woken up by several drunk 20-something men pounding on our door and screaming at each other. I looked out of the peep-hole and saw a guy completely passed out on the floor in front of our door... About 1 minute later his friend (drunk as well) was laughing and trying to pull him up off the ground. Then, we heard them go inside their room next to ours and got to enjoy hearing one of them puking in the toilet for 5 minutes. I called down to the front desk and they said they would send someone up to check on it and about a good 10 minutes later we got a phone call from the staff that they heard people "talking a little loudy" but "nothing out of the ordinary". There were at least two cameras in the hallway and they didn't see what was going on? We had an 11 year old little girl with us who was beyond frightened at all of this. Aside from that, every time we asked for something from the front desk, the gentleman acted rude and put-out. Definitely not worth the $200 we paid for two nights! On the upside, the breakfast was good and the room was pretty clean.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR27718607">I stayed here for four weekday nights on a business trip because it was the cheapest hotel near downtown Seattle on Hotels.com ($63/night). Pros: -- A 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown. -- Great 24-hour coffee in the lobby and a continental breakfast with good selection including waffles. -- Free wireless internet. Ask if you can get a room close to the router for the strongest signal. -- My king bed was extremely downy, clean, and comfortable, with lots of plump pillows. -- The rooms do look like they've had a low-budget remodel, with new chairs, paint, and finishings. Cons: -- My shower would not get warmer than body temperature even when I cranked it all the way up. Standing shower only, no tub. -- There's a lot of construction going on half a block away on a new condo building. It was only noisy during the day, but it could be annoying. -- The elevators are tinny, creaky death traps. -- Some of the furnishings in the room were crappy: 1/2 halogen lights, 1/2 incandescent, chewed up nightstands, little fake-wood mini fridge. -- The "business center" is 2 computers and a printer on a desk in the lobby. Only one computer prints, and they charge $1 per sheet to print. -- $10 parking lot fee per day. Besides the water temperature thing, it was pretty much what I expected for the price. No reason to stay near the Space Needle if you're a tourist, unless you're in love with it or something. It's a little north of "real" downtown.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR26085843">We travelled across to Seattle from Victoria on the Ferry and spent 5 x nights at The Travel Lodge Seattle by the Space Needle. They had completed renovations 6 months earlier and I've got to say....EXCELLENT JOB! Great Location, one block from the space needle and monorail into town. The rooms were just beautiful, My husband and I had a King Bedroom and the teenagers had a room with twin beds. The buffet breakfast was really nice and the staff were very helpful.

Stayed the night on a Friday before an early Saturday morning flight. Checkin was very good, staff at that point were simply great. Based on the reviews posted on here, I expected a great nights sleep with the raves about the new beds and how comfy they were. I am convinced someone who works at this hotel wrote those reviews!! The bed we had (queen) was new maybe, but hard as a rock. It hurt my ribs to lay on my side more than one minute...something I have never experienced...even when laying on a hard floor. Having been to numerous countries, I have experienced some pretty uncomfortable beds. This bed was by far...the worst. I believe what made it so bad, was the pillows they had. They felt like feather pillows...very soft to touch and squeeze. But place your head on it, and they went flat..very flat, stayed flat...felt like sleeping on a sandbag. I never did get to sleep. I gave up at 2:30 am...my body now racked with pain...as if I had been hit by a truck. Have never experienced any kind of bed that actually made my body ache and hurt from laying on it for that short a period of time. Went to the lobby to get a cup of their 24 hour coffee. It was indeed very good coffee...that part was great. Stepped outside the lobby doors to have a smoke, and heard the doors lock behind me. Wasn't sure why that was, but had my key, so no big deal. Watched in amazement as this kid (23?) comes running across the street and right up to the lobby door entrance where I am standing. In pursuit is a white mustang car with 2 thugs in it threatening to kill this guy. I honestly got spooked and decided to step back in and get out the way in case something happened. Guess what...couldn't get back in! No place to put your key and open the doors. Had to wait for the guy on duty to respond to open the door (slow as all heck!) and only after I had convinced him I actually had a room there??? Got brave again after the mustang and thugs took off, and the guy left the front of the hotel. Stepped back out to have another cup of that really good coffee with another smoke...had to calm my nerves! I'm halfway done with my coffee, when up walk 4 young guys...totally hammered. They just hung outside and smoked and joked about the night they just had. Turns out they were military...stationed in Hawaii...on leave I suppose? They were actually very nice guys...although very drunk. They decided to go into their room...again after a couple minutes of trying to convince the guy on duty behind the desk that the hotel keys they were showing were real...and for that hotel. They got about 7 or 8 steps toward the elevator when one of them turns and runs for the door to go outside again. Guess what's coming next?? Yep...barely got the door open, and he just starts puking all over the enrtyway of the lobby just outside the doors. Honestly hurled like for 3 or 4 minutes...a real mess to say the least. Sad to say...at this point I was amused. I began to wonder just what the heck kind of place was this I had booked a room...for 2 nights!! I managed to mostly step around the puke and get back in to the hotel...the night guy knows me by now and just unlocks the door without the formal proof of room rental there. I leave at 4am... FINALLY! I check out and head for the door with my luggage in tow... only to be greeted with this huge pile of puke that there is still no way to get around without having the ability to jump 8-10 feet with luggage in flight. I couldn't believe the lazy desk guy had not at least hosed the mess out of the way...it was a huge mess and he did NOTHING! I asked him how I was to get out without getting the puke on my shoes or luggage, and he simply rolled his eyes and went back into his little room off the back of the front desk. I couldn't believe it! Yes...I got puke on my shoes, simply no way around it without jumping over it....impossible with luggage. Did I mention I had booked a room there for the night after my flight returned....and had already paid for it? Yep I did. Got back into Seattle at 12:30am...dead tired. Even though it had been reserved, and paid for...I drove right on by without even thinking of spending the night there. You could not have paid me to stay there that night...or ever again. And no, I am not making one bit of this up...all true! And you guys that work there at this place...I know you read these reviews because we discussed the rave reviews about your beds at check-in...you really need to find some better night help if nothing else. The night being discussed here was 10-24-2008. All I can say is the coffeee was good.. ..but at $154 a cup in my case...it really should be good coffee!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR21258860">We enjoyed our stay at the Travelodge in Seattle. We did have a few issues, but nothing major and we actually extended another two nights. Pros: - Good size rooms - Large king beds - Really comfy, new linens, duvets and hundreds of pillows - New carpets and nice hallways - Good cable TV service with on demand films, TV programmes - Friendly staff - Free parking - Coffee in reception was actually drinkable - Good location for Space Centre and about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown - Good value, we paid Â£50 inc tax weekday and Â£65 at the weekend - Excellent local pizza delivery place called Bambinos - fresh, homemade and delicious Cons: - We had a downstairs room which smelt really musty and was damp - we didn't bother to ask to move as we spent little time in our room - Bathrooms are a little grungy - they need redoing and the towels were thin - Heating/air con unit was a blast from the past - it just about heated the room up but it was like a jet engine taking off - you could hear everyone elses too - Although the location was good, it was a little 'lively' at night. Having a ground floor room, we were a little distracted by the locals having street races and generally hanging out on a Friday/Saturday night. Probably congragating round the nearby McDonalds. - Housekeeping staff pretty noisy in the morning if you're trying to have a lie in - Breakfast usual free continential buffet but the room is tiny and you're not supposed to take it back to your room (although I sneaked it on a couple of occasions). - They advertise a self-service laundry but looked surprised when I asked to use it (I had run out of pants). Still never got an answer as to why they have it in their in room brochure and website and yet it doesn't exist in the hotel I'd say this is a very good value budget option for Seattle with a car. You can't really get the location with free parking for less. But go for a room higher up and just make sure you don't need to do any laundry!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR20107044">We stayed for 2 nights and it was just okay. You can see that they have really made an effort to renovate, but there are still a few touches needed. For example, the bedding is all new, but the carpeting is still old, the bathrooms still need painting and look grungy, plus the elevators have a funny smell. When we arrived 2 hours before check-in they didn't have any rooms available. However, there is free parking, and they are located close to the Space Needle (only a few blocks away). It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Pike Market, and the front desk staff suggested a great place to eat. But if you are considering booking a room, shop around for rates but then call them directly. We would have saved about $30CAD/night if we called them directly (we know this because Expedia charged us when we booked the room in August, then the hotel accidentally charged us after we checked out). They also do not have a "1-800" number if you are trying to contact the hotel directly and the reservation line (which is a "1-800" number) cannot transfer you. The free continental breakfast is great - they have a variety of foods and you can make your own waffles!

There was also a small pool and an excellent complimentary breakfast along with free wifi. Our main complaint was the rude service we received from the front desk upon arrival and when checking out.

The hotel is still undergoing renovations. The best and worst things about the hotel are its location. It is very close to the space needle (about three blocks away). It's also about a 5-10 minute walk from Lake Union. The neighborhood felt fairly safe during the daytime. I'm not sure if I would walk it at night. There were a few transients in the area. It didn't seem to us as if there were very many restaurants close by. The room was very small, but did seem as if it had been recently renovated. The remote controls for the tv were very simplistic, so that you had to scroll through each channel rather than being able to simply enter the channel you wanted. The free internet in the lobby was cool, but they ask you to limit your time to 15 minutes. The breakfast sucked! I'm still trying to figure out how they can say it has 26 items. The eggs were like hard biscuits and nothing had flavor to it. It was mainly bread, waffles, bagels, and danishes. The hotel staff seemed uninterested.

I also liked the Express Check-In/ Check-Out and the free-internet in the lobby. We had no car during our stay but we reached most of the sightseeing spots of Seattle by foot and those outside Downtown by bus. If you don't want to walk much, you can also take the monorail to get downtown. The Space needle and the EMP and SciFi Museum are only a few minutes away and you can also reach Belltown within 10 minutes, where you can find many nice small restaurants and bars.

Big mistake. I walked in and it was dark &amp; dingy. That should have been my first warning. After booking a room (I was running late for my meeting) I went up in the elevator to the 4th floor (thought it was safest up there) and I thought the elevator was going to break down on the way up. After getting into the hotel room I locked the door and looked around. There was a weird smell which I wasn't able to pin-point until about 15 minutes later when someone was trying to get into my room. I identified that it was a maintenance man before I let him into the room. He tried to explain to me that the carpets had to be steam cleaned because the people before me "made a little mess". A little mess should not require steam cleaning! I sucked it up and wouldn't ask for another room because my thought is it could only get worse. I left for my meeting and came back around 11:30 pm, promptly went up to the room, threw both locks on the door and even put a chair against the door. Heat? Don't think so... it was a heat/air conditioning box by the window that was so loud you couldn't sleep with it on. The night was restless and I woke up several times because I was cold. The sheets were clean, the bed was nice, but the bedspread smelt like vomit and the other one had cigarette burns in it. I promptly left at 8am and didn't even bother to stay for their "new continental" breakfast. I was too frazzled to complain (I've sent a letter to the head office) on the spot. Made it home 3 hours later where I tried to scrub the horror of the room off of me. Never again will I stay in a Travelodge.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR14985712">This hotel is in a great location and rather affordable.

All was okay. Upon arrival, we discovered that there were no queen rooms available. We were offered a room with 2 double beds, and the beds ended up being way too small. The front counter staff(who were the only good part of our experience) offered us a room with a king bed and a hide-a-bed. Unfortunately, the room in question was beside the elevator shaft, and was extremely noisy. On top of that, with the hide-a-bed open, you couldn't access the bathroom????? We ended up back in a double bed room(after an hour of mucking around) and the management only knocked $10 off of our bill. The hotel is extremely run-down. The bathrooms in both rooms we were in were severely dated. The hotel is in the middle of a reno, but from what I saw, the work being done is a bandaid at best. The only positive thing I can say about my stay(other than the cheerful and helpful front desk staff) is that the hotel is very close to all the action. They also offer free parking, IF you can find a spot in their VERY small lot.

Overall out experience was good, keeping in mind that we were looking for a cheap hotel that was close to downtown attractions. I will start with the review of the area since that has come into question in a couple other reviews. The hotel was in an older area of the city most likely built for the 1962 Worldâ€™s Fair. As a result of this there were a few homeless people and possibly drug dealers in the area. It should be mentioned though that these people never bothered us and we walked around the area/city a lot. Often times we walked to dinner and other attractions. I felt safe walking both day and night but I was very aware of my surroundings, keeping an eye out for any possible problems. The location was nice in that it was about a 3 blk walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle area) and from there you could take the monorail into downtown or if you wanted to walk a little further towards downtown you could get on one of the free buses from 6am to 7pm. We did have a rental car which we took at times to go to see the Boeing Tour and Mt. Rainier among other places. The free parking at the hotel was a great benefit as we saw the parking lots in the area charged between $10 &amp; $20/day. Now onto the hotel itself. It is still going through MAJOR UPGRADES. During our stay the put up new lights in the lobby and hallways. They also put new electronic locks on the doors. Due to this upgrade the hallways were not the cleanest at all times (sheetrock and other debris) but this did not affect our room. There is a pool and hot tub which we did not use. I did see a couple of people using the hot tub and it appeared to be nice. I did check one night and the water was very warm so that is a plus. The breakfast area is a room they converted into the breakfast area. The room looks very nice and overall breakfast was pretty good. They had sausage patties and egg patties (similar to what you would get at McDonalds but tasted a little better). They also had cold cereal, bread for toast, bagels, and a small selection of pastries which could have been better. One of the nice things is they had waffle makers. Also, they had a good selection of coffee and four different kinds of juices. Finally, the room was what I expected it to be. It wasnâ€™t large but big enough to fit a king size bed and still have plenty of room to walk around. It had an approximately 21â€� TV with a large selection of channels. It had an approximately 3â€™x3â€™ table and two night stands. In the closet there was an electronic safe which was large enough to fit my laptop The bathroom was old and could use some updating but my only real issue would be that there was only a shower which could be a problem if you wanted to take a bath. Also, the room had free wireless internet which worked about half the time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was told they were going to be upgrading the internet and hopefully it would be more reliable then. There was a flier in the elevator that said they hoped to be done with phase 1 of the upgrades this summer. I should also mention there were two computers in the lobby available for guest use and when we arrived there was a printer attached to one of them but they took out the printer about half way through out stay. I wasnâ€™t using it so I didnâ€™t ask if they would be putting it back or what happened to it. As I stated before, overall I was happy with hotel and would probably stay here again. All my wife and I want when we go on vacation is a clean and safe place to sleep as we spend very little time in our room. Probably the worst part was the neighborhood which unfortunately they have very little control over.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR11643549">We stayed for 1 day and a night the hotel itself is cheap and cheerful but if you like the sound of Air con units all day and all night this is the place for you.

The police never returned my complaint call. the prostitues and pimps and drug atticts are around this whole area where other hotels are located also. I'm apauled they let this happen there, my family will never return to this city again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR8669157">I do not really get what the complaints are about here. The staff was very nice. Rooms are clean and basic. We paid 100 a night on priceline and it was worth it, right near seattle center where you can also take the monorail to downtown. The showers had great water pressure. My only complaint would be the pillows. 2 flat pillows is not acceptable. They should either have 2 good ones or 4 pillows. We asked for 2 pillows and they were brought up to us. It was a minor thing, we would definitely stay again. We did not eat breakfast there so I cannot comment on that.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8512926">Three of us shared a room for one night while in town to attend a Seattle Seahawks game. We basically just needed a place to sleep, and that's why we chose this property. They asked us at check in which floor we would rather have - we said the ground floor, but when we discovered that the pool was right outside our window, we opted for the third floor overlooking an alley. Plus, you could really smell the chlorine. Our second attempt was much better, the room did not smell, and it was very tidy. There was a small in-room safe, but no fridge. The bathroom was small - we did have a tub - and one of the outlets in our room was not working, but overall the condition of the room was what I expected for a $70 a night hotel in the downtown area of a major city. There was a shuttle to and from the game for $2.50 each way and a complimentary Sunday paper. The continental breakfast included toast, pastries, bagels and muffins and the usual breakfast beverages. We chose bagels, but they did not taste good at all, so we just popped over to the Starbucks a block away. The major complaint that I would have about this property is that they need to do renovations in their bathrooms. The fan in the bathroom was not working well, and with three women, we needed a little more room and a little less humidity. From the other reviews I've read, it sounds as though the comfort of your stay might depend on which room you are given, as they don't have standard amenities in every room (no tubs or fridges in some). A good hotel for the price and if you just need a place to sleep, but I would not recommend this hotel for lengthy stays.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7839333">I'm considering relocating to Seattle and spent nearly a week touring the area on a budget. Even for the price (about $70 per night), this place was well below what I expected. The room and hallways were dirty; the smell of urine permeated the parking lot - seems several homeless people were sleeping behind the hedges at a neighboring business. There are other economical hotels in this same area -- try one of those instead.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7670794">We stayed here for 5 nights on a trip to Seattle. I don't expect much from budget accommodation, you do get what you pay for, but for the time that we actually spend at the hotel (left daily at 8am, back at 9:30pm) I cannot complain. The hotel is very well situated with a Starbucks (surprise!) just around the corner at a gas station. It is also a short walk from the Space Needle and the 5 Point CafÃ©. We had no trouble walking around at night. Our room overlooked the pool with the Jacuzzi/spa bath and on our first night it was a bit noisy outside. (In summer, one might have to keep that in mind.) After traveling for 24 hours the noise did not really bother us. The room was spacious, clean, it had a safe and a small fridge which came in handy. There is a bit of a gap between the room door and the floor which lets through a bit of light in the evening (if you like to sleep in total darkness like I do), but a towel quickly sorted that out. Our towels were nice and fluffy and that there was no bath did not bother us at all. The hotel lift is a bit stuffy. The breakfast is quite a sugary affair but coffee, orange juice, a wonderful Washington apple and a bagel can set you up for the start of the day. I would definitely stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7479294">This hotel is not very clean. There was no bathtub- only a small shower. We were traveling with a baby- so we were not able to bath her there. It is cheap and the location is very close to the space needle. However, the area is a little bit seedy. We also recieved a call to our room- my husband answered and a woman on the phone asked "Do you want some company?", when he asked who was calling she said "Oh, this is Candy", and he hung up. We spoke with the front desk about it, and they told us that the call must have come from within the hotel- because there had not been any calls connected to our room through them. This did not make us feel much better. He said that it wasn't the first time that someone complained about prostitiues calling the rooms. We switched hotels to the La Quinta Inn and Suites, a little bit more money- but it was way nicer.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR7403127">While the rates were ok for this hotel, I find their hotel description somewhat misleading (newly completed renovations, finished in 1997???). The rooms are outdated for 1987 actually. They're a normal size, beds are alright. Our family is usually as budget minded as they come, and we picked this hotel for proximity to Space Needle. However, after one night we switched hotels. The area around this hotel is very suspect. The hallways are pretty noisy (and the big inch-high gaps under the doors made in the 50's or 60's don't help for noise reduction). My husband and kids tried the hot tub but couldn't get out fast enough when a layer of scum covered the water when they turned on the jets. Our travel rewards program rates this hotel a Tier 4, out of 5. We've stayed in budget hotels all over western Canada &amp; the US - this is the only one we've left after one night. There's no way it should be a Tier 4 - I shudder to imagine what a Tier 1 would be like. I doubt I would ever check availability at this hotel again. I only picked it since it was the only reasonably priced hotel near Space Needle with a pool. I would now either spend a few extra min driving or give up the pool. You'd have to be seriously budget minded to enjoy this hotel. Also, if you're looking for the downtown action and proximity promised by this hotel, be prepared for a long walk. It was many blocks before we were into that kind of area.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6647478">Great location but rooms could do with some updating, the windows didn't open (ground floor) so room was dim &amp; stuffy.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6567033">We were pleased with the staff and location upon arriving to this Travelodge by the Space Needle.

As for food we were told of a place to get pizza from and it was the best any of the 4 of us can recall....and was hot when we got it. The room also comes with continental breakfast which was great while we waited for our taxi to catch the clipper home at the end of our vacation.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR6001985">My boyfriend and I stayed over Easter weekend and chose the hotel because of its location and parking. We paid about $70 USD for the room. It's central to everything, walkable to the market and neighbourhoods with good restaurants and the space needle. Aside from the location (and parking) it was not a pleasant stay. The hallways smelled of smoke, the room was clean but in need of renovation. At reception there was a sign stating that they don't rent rooms for the purpose of underage drinking (or somethign to that effect). The blackout curtains were completely ripped (I mentioned this and asked that they be replaced but they never were) and the pillows were covered in plastic. We were woken up repeatedly by late night partiers and a barking dog. When I went down to get the continental breakfast (muffins, fruit, coffee) I was joined by some pretty dodgy people who did not look like they were staying there. And then on my way back up there was an empty beer bottle in the elevator. We travel on a budget but I would have been happy to pay more for a quieter, safer feeling hotel. The Best Western across the street looked like it might have been better. If you're looking for a relaxing, low key place to stay in the city, this isn't it.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5334138">The hotel was convenient for us. We could walk to the space needle, catch the bus to downtown. We took a tour and they picked us up right at the front door, went to a baseball game and the desk arrranged transportation to and from. the heated pool was nice, breakfast of ok, nothing fantastic but we have had worse. It does need remodeling but it was clean and the price was right. I would stay there again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR5291408">We hadn't planned on staying at this hotel during our visit to Seattle in April 2006, but it proved to be a great experience. The accomodations were clean and adequate, the staff was efficient and friendly and the price was budget oriented. Due to the location of the Travelodge, we parked our car and walked to restaurants and attractions. The free ride service was several blocks away but once we became familiar with how to navigate around Seattle via the buses we were on our way. We met interantional travelers and had a great time seeing the city up close and personal. There were some noisy neighbors who had children and/or were partying but that did not spoil our stay. After spending two weeks traveling through Wahington, the Travelodge provided us with one of the "best beds" we experienced during our vacation. Keep up the great work.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR5066196">This travelodge is very run down, the only thing good about it, is that it's close to the space needle. It costs to much for what you get. I'll drive if I have to next time. I will never stay there again. They need to fix the place up!!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4972112">I stayed at the Travelodge in mid-late March 2006. I booked online and paid upfront; the cost was $455 for 5 nights including tax. I was a bit disappointed on arrival to discover that the hotel isn't exactly in downtown Seattle as their writeup on the booking site claimed ("in the heart of downtown Seattle"). I didn't have a car so having cafes/restaurants close by was important to me, especially being a lone female. The writeup also claimed that "Guests will be able to walk to myriad restaurants, bars, and entertainment options" -- whilst this is technically true, the implication that there are lots of such places very close by is NOT true! I did find a truly wonderful Mexican cafe-restaurant about 4 blocks away, called Dos Amigos -- can't recommend this place highly enough. And the pizza delivery place Romio's (found in the hotel information folder in my room) has totally great food. But this hotel is not placed like its writeup implies. Frankly the main part of downtown starts about 5 or 6 blocks away, and goes for about 8 or 10 blocks over 5 streets, so be warned. If you don't have a car and want to get around a significant part of downtown you will be doing a lot of walking! (The Monorail was out of action while I was there) Having said that, overall I enjoyed my stay at the Travelodge. The walls and ceilings are a little thin; whilst I was never bothered by other guests' TVs or conversation, the creaky floorboards right above my bed were a bit annoying! Especially since the people above me had a habit of coming back around 1 in the morning... Initially I was allocated a room on the ground floor. On getting to the room I found this was no exaggeration -- the room's window looked right out onto the back parking lot, and if I'd left the window open anybody could have climbed in. Once again as a lone female I wasn't happy with this; I rang the front desk and asked for a higher-up room, and there was no problem. The clerk even wheeled along a luggage cart so moving my stuff would be easier, having noticed me struggling with my four pieces of luggage getting to the original room (I had skis and boots as well as suitcases). Very sweet. In fact this guy really made my stay at Travelodge. There were so many little thoughtful things he did (name is Greg, he was on afternoon-evening shift while I was there). On the Friday and Saturday nights I was there, I was *very* glad I'd asked for a room above ground floor -- the general area the hotel is in gets quite noisy and I would have been anxious about undesirables outside my room. As it was I felt perfectly safe and the noise was simply a minor annoyance. The free breakfast was tasty (juices, coffee, apples, donuts and other things made of donut dough, muffins) but I would have preferred the addition of some cereals. However it was lovely not to have to go in search of food first thing in the morning. My room had a King size bed, which had linens just a little bit too small but was firm and comfy. Good size wardrobe with plenty of hangers. A mini fridge, which I turned off because the noise would have woken me in the night. The heater/air conditioner was difficult to get to the right temperature. For some reason if I was warm enough during the day I was too hot at night. I turned it off each night but this didn't make things any better. Plenty of channels on the TV, which was installed in a sort of entertainment centre kum dresser (three large drawers under the TV which provided plenty of clothes storage space). A nice large table where I could set up my laptop. And an easy chair which I never sat in, because it was impossible to see the TV from there. Oh and a glass table which was handy for putting the pizza boxes on! The bedside tables were just tables, i.e. no drawers, which I found a bit annoying. Blackout curtains at the windows -- total darkness when pulled, very nice. The bathroom was an adequate size for one or two people. The shower was in good condition (with a door!) and had one of those adjustable shower heads so you could get it to do a sort of massage. The water pressure was right on the hairy edge of being good enough, but it was OK. However one big annoyance was that the water temperature took forever to get hot enough for an enjoyable shower! I got into the habit of turning it on 5 minutes before I wanted a shower. I don't like to waste resources so I found this very sub-par, but it really was necessary. If I didn't wait that long, the water would be only just warm enough to shower in, and I'd be shivering away, and then right at the end of the shower the water would finally get hot enough to be pleasant. I wanted to just be left alone, having just come from a disastrous stay with New Zealand friends in Canada, sleeping on the floor in the living room with zero privacy in a dump of an apartment. So I hung the DND sign out as soon as I arrived and never brought it back in. Housekeeping put notices under the door for the first two days saying if I wanted the room serviced to please remove the DND sign before 1pm. After that they figured that I wanted to be left alone. So I can't comment on the standard of housekeeping, except to say I had no complaints on arrival. I had a couple of sits in the spa pool. Not much to say here -- a perfectly adequate pool and since I was in need of a bit of hydrotherapy on my left shoulder, very appreciated. You can ask for extra towels at the front desk on your way to the pool. There's a bin at poolside where you're supposed to drop your pool towels, but since that meant going back up to my room shivering in my swimsuit, I didn't do that! Very appreciated was the free local calls (up to 20 mins duration) and unlimited free 1-800 calls. This enabled me to speak to my husband in New Zealand, over the internet for free! Since at that time we hadn't talked for 6 weeks it was very nice indeed. It also allowed me to do significant online research about Seattle and its environs which allowed me to make the most of my time there. Another thing I really appreciated was the free toiletries. I'd arrived with no toothpaste, and it was lovely not to have to find a grocery or drug store on the evening of my arrival. There was a note in my bathroom saying that they had a range of toiletries available for free. Very nice touch. They also offered me a toothbrush when I asked for the toothpaste. To sum up: this hotel is definitely a budget hotel. Don't go if you want a luxury experience, or if you mind thin walls/ceilings, or if you want to really be in downtown Seattle. But the staff are friendly, the beds are comfy, the showers are nice once they're hot enough, and the price is about right.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR4094370">The rooms are cold and damp and NOT cozy by any means and the building is old. The windows make you feel like you're in jail or something. The hallways have that old run-down, cold motel feeling. For $10 more you could stay at a nicer inn/motel/hotel down the street at the La Quinta and get a better experience, that's what we did the very next day, and we were very pleased. The travelodge by the space needle leaves you with a bitter cold feeling when you're there, but if you don't care about coziness and want to save $10, then this place isn't bad. But being in Seattle when it's cold and rainy, you will long for that warm, coziness you can get at the La Quinta on 8th ave and not here. I will never want to stay here again after what I experienced. The only thing I liked about the hotel was that the staff was real courteous.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR3945786">We spoent 3 nights in September, 2005 at this location and enjoyed every minute.

I will agree with previous reviews about the hotel being in dire need of updating (both structurally &amp; decoratively) but fast elevators &amp; fancy artwork are not lodging necessities for me. Our first room did not have a fridge (I thought all rooms did but I guess they don't) &amp; without hesitation, Dan graciously switched us to the Sleepy Bear Den, a room with not only a fridge but a VCR (which we didn't use, though, since the hotel only stocks kid movies, but "Sex &amp; the City" was on so who needs movies)...&amp; didn't charge us the higher rate! He was also very helpful with info about the city bus (which has a stop about 500 yards from the hotel). My friend &amp; I found the hotel to be in a great location since it was within walking distance to the Space Needle &amp; surrounding attractions, &amp; it's near the interstate. Finding a parking spot was never a problem, &amp; the area appeared to be safe (I was worried about my car but nothing happened). Our room was clean &amp; contained all the standard amenities, &amp; was quiet. The best feature was the wireless internet access in all the rooms...I logged right on &amp; got up-to-the-minute info about things to do in the area. While I did not use it, I did take a look at the pool &amp; it looked great. Breakfast was nothing to write home about...just a typical continental breakfast. But overall, I would stay at the Travelodge again &amp; again as the price &amp; location cannot be beat.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR3610387">The hotel is not brand new, but it was good for the money and location. It could stand an updating, but overall I found it to be clean. The staff was super friendly and very helpful.

The hotel has wi-fi in the lobby and dial-up in the room, for those folks who are slaves to their computers. The hotel is located three blocks from Seattle Center (Space Needle, Sci-Fi Museum, Experience the Music Project and carnival rides.) The monorail is at the Seattle Center as well, which means you can ride to downtown shopping area and near Pike's Place Market without having to worry about traffic and parking.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR2967091">The Travelodge does 'what it says on the tin.' Its a basic no frills hotel/motel that provides accomodation in a good location with easy access to the I-5 and a classic 24hr boozer/diner just down the street. The shuttle bus for Safeco Field was a good deal as well. The room has a shag carpet 70s-80s feel to it, likely because thats when it was built or last upgraded, but so what.

Upon pulling up, I thought, this doesn't look that bad as the outside painting and lighting was somewhat modern looking. I checked in around 11pm-midnight and the evening clerk was friendly and helpful. I walked down the hall and it doesn't smell the freshest. Head upstairs, there's a door held open by a washcloth as it was for the 3 evenings I was there. My room was just okay. I tried not to look too closely. So, here's what I think. I needed a place near Children's Hospital, this property was about half the price of others within this vicinity. I was at the hospital all day and came back tired and would crash from about midnight until 5-6am and then back to the hospital. For the amount I saved over other properties, and the amt. of time I was actually in the hotel, it worked. Or, if I was partying with old college buddies and we had too many adult beverages I'd be okay. But, I would not bring my wife here in its existing state, I would not bring my kids here in it's existing state. I hope the remodel makes the difference for them. It is a very convenient location. Across the street from University Village. In fact, I ran from the hospital to grab lunch for us and a benefit was I was able to park in the Travelodge parking lot to run in and get lunch across the street. There was no room in the University Village parking lot and parking was crazy due to a UW bball game. I filled out a review that they sent to me and I was impressed with the quick response from their team. So, i hope they get it cleaned up.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR125359924">I stayed in room #119 at Travelodge in Seattle Washington near the University of Washington. The room was clean. I inspected it for cleanliness before I brought my luggage into the room. I even pulled back the sheets and inspected the mattress edges. It was perfectly clean and there were no odors. I have stayed at another popular hotel near the University several times and because their prices went up and I am on a budet, I tried this one. This room had a refrigerator and a microwave which I had to supply my own at the other more expensive hotel. The lower cost was reflected in the more trimmed down breakfast bar, which I did not care about. No one bothered me at all. I did not opt to have my room cleaned during my stay but each morning the cleaning staff was on hand and happy to give me fresh towels or anything I needed for my room. It felt safe. I never had the feeling of being afraid during my visit there. If you stay in the winter I would advise bringing an extra blanket for the bed or use the heater in the room. It was a little loud, but it also served as a good "white noise" machine. Every hotel I have ever stayed in has hallway noise of doors opening and closing so this would drown that all out.

We had read some poor reviews but we were willing to give it a chance based on the great rates offered to us by expedia. It wasn't worth the value. Although the girls were disgusted by the carpeting, the draping and the stains on the couch and the sunken in cushions, it was spacious and the bedrooms seemed adequate enough. However, all 4 of us received a maximum of maybe 2-3 hours of sleep each. The beds were extremely uncomfortable, and would constantly creak at every movement. There was also a construction crew that began working outside the hotel at 6am and that woke all of us up as the paper thin walls allowed us to hear every word said between the construction workers as well as the constant drilling and sawing.

The rooms are typical in size and furnishings, and are clean for the most part, but, wear and tear is becoming more obvious: there were hooks for pictures on the walls, but one picture was missing. Similar hooks remained in the wall for a bedside lamp, but it had been replaced with a table lamp. The corners of the bathroom floor hadn't been cleaned recently. The pool and hot tub are not open. There are cracks walls. Still the location is great and there is (limited) free parking. The breakfast room is tiny and therefore crowded. The breakfast is very limited. A few annoying things include a charge daily for the safe in the room even if, like us, it is not used.

Air conditioner didn't work, so it was extremely stuffy all night, noises from neighbors on balcony precluded opening windows for ventilation, and paper-thin walls which let us hear the snorer next door made it not a good sleep. There was very old furniture and the unit was not maintained. The office smelled heavily of smoke, though the surly clerk insisted it was a non-smoking hotel.

A complete kitchenette with empty cupboards - no utensils, dishes, pots, pans. The outlets were not grounded so the microwave had an adapter plug to accomodate the 2 prong outlets. I can only imagine how long its been since the carpet was cleaned- and I had to wonder what sort of activites had taken place on the couch - ick. There was a dirty spoon behind one bed. The upside... surprisingly enough we did NOT see any bugs and if you looked beyond the rusty drains and fixtures - the tub, sink and toilet appeared to be clean. The front desk staff was pleasant and the housekeeper was very helpful. This was not worth $120/night.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR89554494">Nothing nice but ok if you are just passing though and need a place to sleep.

Full kitchen with old and dirty range and completely unstocked with pots or pans or dishes or utensils, etc. Small bathroom had peeling paint and loose wallpaper. Holes in the wall where towel racks had been removed and not spackled or painted. Medicine cabinet was very rusty although mirrored front was fine. Paper thin walls and floors so neighbors sounds were a problem at times. Smoke detectors were missing their batteries so did not work. A towel was stuffed in the crack between the A/C and the outside wall. Furniture was old and saggy and not enough of it to accomodate 4 adults.

And it sounds like they have REALLY high standards!

If you are looking to stay in your room or enjoy the amenities this is not the place for you. As you enter the carpet need to be replaced and it is a old property. Our greeting was great though and the front desk gal was very friendly. We were there for a Husky football game and it was a pleasant mile walk to the stadium. This may sound like a distance but when you are walking with many other fans and through the tailgate parties it is entertaining even in the rain. We also were able to enjoy the shopping at what I think is one of the best malls in the PNW which is and outdoor University Mall. All you have to do is walk across the street. Yes, the rooms are dated, yes, the water is iffy, yes, you may go hmmmm, when you walk in...BUT if you are looking for a great place to shop, go to the UW Campus AND get free parking, this is your place. If you are looking to visit Seattle this would not be for you as you are quite away from the sites. Ask for a room in the back and yes you will be facing a unattractive apartment complex but I was shock that we heard NOTHING from them all night long. I slept better here than in some 4 stars that we normally stay. If you are looking to get out of your room and shop and visit campus this place if for you. If you are looking for a more boutique environment I would recommend the Hotel Deco on the other side of campus which is also a great property.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR81402547">I read the reviews after I'd booked and seriously thought about changing hotels. When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find things much better than I'd expected. If you want $150 a night service, don't expect it for as little as $75 a night (check out the midweek and fourth-night free deals). This is also a hotel that will under some circumstances allow under-21s to stay independently. So what of the complaints? I found the staff very helpful with things like getting around on buses, taking a lot of time and effort. Yes, they were more reserved and purposeful than some hotel receptionists, but one Sandi is worth ten obsequious bellhops and made my trip run really smoothly despite a tight budget. Rooms, a little dated but clean. Mine was by the pool so smelled a little of chlorine but I soon stopped noticing. The pool, incidentally, looked clean and I saw it being cleaned. Air conditioning units are noisy but not needed most of the year, I just opened the window, even in August. Showers did vary in temperature particularly when someone flushes, sometimes I just stepped out of the (powerful) flow for a minute until it sorted itself out. There is a bath option to avoid this. Some rooms are by a door or stairwell so will have some noise, ask when booking if that's a problem. My bed was comfortable and the towels and sheets were not torn or dirty. Continental breakfast consisted of two cereals (varying), packs of hot cereal mix, small packaged muffins, brown and white bread for toasting, two flavors of jelly, apples and bananas, tea/coffee and two fruit juices. More than enough for me. The room was small so many people took it back to their rooms, but it did encourage you to meet the other guests. Location is excellent - University Village opposite, which is basically a mall disguised as bijou shops. The University of Washington is a fifteen minute walk away, including an uphill section, or a bus goes from down the street. From UW you change for buses to most places in the wider area. Don't get me wrong, I can see why some people commented negatively on some aspects, but I have stayed in many worse US motels and hotels and, for the price and star rating, this is a well-situated and good option. If you prefer cooked breakfasts, updated rooms and nothing but insincere smiles from your check-in staff, look elsewhere. Ultimately if I was returning to Seattle, I would definitely stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR72285222">We booked this "hotel" for our 3 night stay in Seattle mostly because of the price. We certainly got what we paid for. Dark, dingy hallways with a weird smell and stained carpets, the same 3 cigarette butts and crushed red Lifesaver on the outside steps the whole time we were there, the key card was hit and miss, the ugly, ugly hot tub area at the opposite end of the building from the pool, thanks, that's very handy. Now for the room: it's quite large, so that was good, but we were put right next to the stairwell so we could hear people going up and down at all hours, the air-con was soooo loud there was no way to sleep with it on so we had to open the window and listen to the street noise and people checking in at 2 am. First day I pulled back the bed looking for an outlet for my laptop and there was a pile of goldfish crackers that had been there for who knows how long. The sheets on one of the beds was torn and the towels were frayed. The continental "breakfast" was horrible, and they were out of orange juice 2 of the 3 mornings we were there. And now, I have saved the best two things for last: the fuse for the room would blow each morning while I dried my hair. I guess we were foolish to think I could dry my hair with the TV and one light on. And finally, the shower would fluctuate from scalding hot to freezing cold every shower, every time. We were nervous for our young son to take a shower for fear he would burn himself. I think the shower thing bothered us most of all. For compensation from the front desk we got a paltry $30 taken off our bill. I guess the location is good if you need to be near the University or the hospital, but for us it was a bit of a trek to the downtown area. So folks, consider yourself warned!! Thanks Travelodge for being a memorable part of our visit to Seattle,<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR67552626">Our son was touring the University of Washington. I selected this motel because I wanted to be close to the campus. I have to honestly say that if I could have found another place that night, I would have moved. The room was filthy and smelled. I was seriously concerned that the bed may have bugs since they were old and very uncomfortable. When my husband and I left to meet our son for dinner, we noticed that the door would not lock. When we advised the front desk about the door, they told us don''t worry, we'll fix it while your gone. Of course we were uncomfortable leaving with our belongings in the room. Although they claimed the door was fixed, the door never closed properly. Breakfast consisted of OJ, Coffee, cereal, small packaged little blueberry and banana muffins.This property is close to the campus, but the location is not great and it's in a VERY congested area. I was happy when the morning came and we were able to check out. I've always relied on trip advisor for reviews before staying at motels. This time I was fooled by some who reviewed this place as decent. This is NOT a good place to stay. There are many motels in Seattle.

There was a lot of traffic getting to the hotel because of it's close location to the University. Initially I was a little worried because Travelodge hotels are usually run down or worst...filled w/ prostitutes and drugs as of my experience in a Travelodge in Tennessee. But the reviews led me to try again. As we arrived, the location is situated across the street from a huge mall and in a well kept neighborhood. The building had a more modern architectual look to it and very nice colors. The clerk name Zaira was very helpful....service compared to a more luxury hotel. She helped us w/ all types of tourist questions and was not even annoyed...which can happen a lot. As we proceeded to our room, there is a security door for guest only, which is very safe. The room it self had great space and very clean, looked recently remodeled. Everything was functional and in order. The only problems I had was that the walls are very thin, the bed was a little out of shape and it took 10 mins for the hot water to come out...ironically being that they want you to reuse towels to save water? Also the Manager SHIRLEY was very nice to us as we asked her questions during the evening. The breakfast was juice, oatmeal, muffins, two types of cereal (both nasty), and fruit. Luckily all food products were individually wrapped or sealed because the clerk had a vicious cold (coughing, and spitting mucous) when I was IFO the door. I would highly recommend this place.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR56082856">I really enjoyed stayng at the Travelodge.

For $80 a night, I stayed in a room that: - had warm, but not hot water, so I could never take shower without getting cold, and I had to wait about 2-3 minutes before any warm water came out of the faucet in the first place. - was "non-smoking" but directly across the hall from the smoking rooms, so that the smell travelled into my room at 6 am when my neighbors decided to light up. - was darkly lit, smelled strongly of cleaning detergent and had stains bed cover - was cleaned by very polite housekeepers, but a remarkably rude and unfriendly staff. Today, I checked out of the hotel and for $20 less a night am staying in a friendly, clean chain with warm water, a sauna, and a room that reminds me that my Travelodge experience was rare and not to be tolerated.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR10083718">Without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. A friend and I mistakenly chose to stay here for a conference at the University, and from the moment we arrived, the stay was completely revolting. Upon trying to check in, there were problems with both of our reservations, about which the clerk only laughed. His attitude was that this is what we deserved for daring to stay in this dump. After waiting a good 30 minutes to get our room keys, we entered the wing where our rooms were. We were first greeted by an atrocious and overpowering smell - something along the lines of a mixture of mildew, urine, and some toxic chemical probably used to attempt to clean. The hallways were barely lit. Then we entered our rooms to a slightly less strong stink - no toxic flavor, just mildew and urine. On turning on the light, one of the (at most) 25 watt bulbs was burnt out. Turning on the others gave only slightly more light - a nice dim, dank look complimented the smell nicely. The carpeting was slightly damp - I tried not to think about what I was walking in. The room was a bit chilly when we arrived, so I turned on the "heater/air conditioner", but no matter what knobs I turned where, no heat came out - only cold air - no matter how long I waited. At least I was able to turn mine off; when my friend tried the same with his, he found that it just kept going - so the thing was blowing cold air into his room all night. The bathroom was crap, but ok. It took a good 5 minutes for the shower water to become remotely hot. The walls were dirty, had various stains and marks, and rusty outlines told us where some racks used to hang. I had a good bathroom, it seems, as my friends' toilet didn't flush, he was unable to get more than a tiny stream of water to flow from his faucet, and his bathtub had numerous brown stains throughout. Oh, and he had one less lamp in his room than I did. The bed was uncomfortable at best and there were numerous holes in the sheets/blankets. The pillows were comically thin - I had to stack two to get a reasonable "pillow". And on top of everything, when I figured to myself I could at least do a little work to take my mind off the decrepit surroundings, I found that the wireless signal was too weak to get internet access. I proceeded to walk around the floor, open laptop in hand checking to see if the signal ever improved, but no such luck. The complimentary breakfast: disgusting. I took one bite of the soggy, plastic-wrapped muffin and instantly threw the rest away. There was cereal, but no milk for it. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried - heed this and all the other awful reviews of this complete embarrassment of an establishment and simply stay away. This heap should be a tourist attraction in and of itself - visit to see the squalor and to laugh at those who stupidly paid money to stay here, but don't spend a cent to stay yourself.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR8472119">This lodging was obtained through priceline.com.

We had two 2 bedroom units. It was the worst hotel we have ever stayed in, and we tried desperately to find anything else to get out of this dump. On the first night, returning from the rehearsal, my daughter found that her room key would not work, and that another couple was standing at our other door, attempting to use their key to open the room. The clerk had given them our room number as their room. The clerk sneered at my daugher when she went to the desk to sort out the problem. No apology, just ridicule. He then totally berated our other daughter when she paid for a parking pass for a third car - he even threatened that our cars might be damaged or that he might have them towed away by morning. Understand that we weren't unpleasant to him, we just seemed to catch him in the middle of a nervous breakdown. To top it off, when my husband went to the desk (we were afraid to send our adult daughters back under any circumstances) to ask for pillows and blankets for the bed chesterfield, the clerk handed my husband 6 towels and said he had no more pillows or blankets. Our bedding was stained, my mom's blanket was dirty, the bathroom was shabby and the floor was cracked. Some walls had pictures, some had bare hooks where pictures had once been. The wallpaper was dirty and marked. Our dining room table had 4 chairs (2 of them broken), while the other room had only 1 chair to go with the table. That room also had no dishes at all. Ours had 1 cup, 1 glass and an assortment of broken, unmatched dishes and cutlery. We gave our other room 2 of our 3 spoons. The pots were beat-up teflon that had rust on the bottom. I wouldn't boil water in them. Neither two-bedroom unit was clean and the furniture and rugs were noticeably stained. The door to the deck had no handle, and in my sister's room the vertical blinds were falling off when she tried to open her door (which also was broken). The beds had a flat mattress protector and thin, flat sheets - so when we slept we ended up on the bare mattress. It was enough to send chills down all our spines. This was the worst dump we have ever experienced, and we would gladly have packed and moved on the first night, despite it being almost 11:00 P.M by the time the clerk finished with us. I was so embarassed to have my mom with us, and my sister also renting a room. How can Travel Lodge allow this dive to carry its name? We expected a basic room, but we expected it to be clean and reasonably furnished with dishes, cutlery and pots, and bedding. I have never heard of a hotel not providing extra pillows and blankets (we only had 4 pillows in each room, and were not being unreasonable requesting pillows for the bed chesterfield). To top it off, there is major construction next door and it starts before 7:00 A.M.

When I arrived, I was told I was too early to check in so I asked if they could check my bags while I went for a walk to the UW. They agreed and just put them behind the front desk without taking my name or giving me a check tag, which might've been okay if there was a person there too, but when you walk into the office, there's just an empty front desk area while the staff hide away in a back room. In other words, it would take about 5 seconds for someone to reach over and steal my bags. I asked them to store my luggage which contained a camcorder and my laptop in the backroom like any normal hotel would but they refused. When it came time to check into my room I was horrified. Both of my chairs were badly stained as was the bedskirt. I had to lay towels down on the chairs to feel comfortable sitting on them. My lampshade was also stained with what was either coffee or blood. I'm not sure which and didn't care to find out. At night you could either choose to freeze your butt off or turn on the ridiculously loud heater. The pipes and shower head had a lot of visible rust and the bathroom just didn't seem clean.

You have to put aside expectations about 'hotel'. Domus Ester has a small office/reception on a higher floor of an ancient building in the old centre of Rome. Rooms are small, price is very small, comfort is very good for the money, style of the rooms very very good, consistent with the local environment, exposed beams maybe 4-500 years old. And you get to experience what is conventional with Italian apartments, a bathroom in which a cat would have difficulty turning around. This is Rome, if you want Dallas, go to Dallas. Step outside with a map (very helpful, cheerful reception staff, but be conscious they are also running to service rooms, not hanging about waiting for you) and the centre of the western world is at your feet, and reachable on foot easily. DON'T pay for the tourist bus, go to a newstand on the street and buy a daily or weekly or monthly metro pass. Weekly costs ?Euros16, monthly Euros 30. Fantastic way to live the life of the city, buses and underground. Shop or eat near the major city tourist attractions and expect the major city tourist quality and price. Take the tram (ask at desk, walk 200 metres) to Trastevere, especially for restaurants or Saturday mornings for the Porta Portese market (where you can buy a new suitcase for the market loot also! :-) Find a stop for the magic 116 bus (see last entry at my http://duemesi.blogspot.com ) and be taken on a wonder journey through the city to the Villa Borghese. You must book ahead for the Borghese Gallery (giving you crowd control for a couple of hours access to what we think is the best gallery in Rome, in an historic park where locals relax at weekend). But be conscious that every corner where you walk, near Domus Ester, is history. It sits on the Field of Mars, where generals returned from war camped with their armies awaiting Senate approval to enter the city for their 'triumph'. 'No Littering' signs on the corner from the 1700s. Walk west towards the Capital (Campidoglio) and the Forum and Coliseum and, especially in the historical Jewish quarter, marvel at how builders have included bits of older buildings, up to 2000 years old, in subsequent multiple rebuilds. Don't just run between designated tourist sites. Look at every building, every cobblestone... around here every historical figure of Roman history has walked and breathed Every church nearby has its distinct visceral character (and free amazing art exhibitions). Incomparable value unless you want overdressed and supercilious creepy attendants to bow at you with their hands out.

If you are claustrophobic, I would think about staying in a hotel outside of Rome and getting the train in every day. The rooms are small and I mean small. The bathroom was biggish with a bath and well stocked with freebies and the rooms were immaculately clean - you can't fault them for that. The landlady was very friendly and spoke better English than many Londoners. So if you can bear to have the walls coming in on you, its a great place to stop. Certainly for the price, you won't find better.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR103795714">Small hotel located on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old building in a quiet alley, in convenient walking distance of the river, Trastevere, the big shopping streets, and all the historic squares and cultural heritage sites. Taxi driver found the street without problems, there is a big brass plaque on the door with the name Domus Ester, and as the reception staff has the front door under video surveillance, he/she will buzz the front door open for you the minute you have arrived. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Top quality beds. Freshly brewed coffee and tea, warm rolls, slices of rustic fresh bread, butter and jam brought to your room every morning. Lots of space for clothes. Very small bathroom but nice and clean, with everything working perfectly. Only minus as I see it is the lack of a lounge and bar for a night cap, but then there are loads of cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood where you may hang out with your friends instead - or you may shop at the Spar supermarket just around the corner and bring the stuff to your room and store it in the mini fridge.

Our room had once upon a time opened directly onto the main stairwell, and though that door is now completely sealed, the smell of rubbish from the communal garbage cans at the bottom, along with people's conversations, did carry up into the room from time to time. As this July was very hot (temps in the mid-30s up) this meant choosing between fresh (but hot) air from the open window, or keeping it cool with the aircon with the risk of occasional smells. That really was the only negative, however. Otherwise, it was great to be in such a handy location, right in the middle of Rome, and the lack of pretension was a nice change from more up-market hotels. The room was spacious, with attractive rafters on the ceiling, and the minibar fridge can be reorganised to accommodate your own water bottles etc. Breakfast is basic, but delivered to your room, which is nice, and the place felt generally pretty secure. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They also provide a €50 transport service to/from either airport, but if you are traveling light then you might also want to consider getting a cab from the taxi rank up the road at Torre Argentina, which could work out cheaper...<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR76008129">Domus Ester was everything we needed and looked for.

Esthetically our room looked fine, and the bathroom was very spacious indeed. It appeared to be newly renovated, clean and included a shower and a large bathtub, but there was a peculiar odor of sewage. We assumed the smell must have been coming from the open window. We didn’t have time to pay attention to whatever the smell was or where it was coming from because we had tickets to the Vatican Museums, and about 10 minutes to drop off our luggage and head out to the Vatican. When we returned to our room later that evening the smell of sewage made relaxing impossible. Where was this horrific smell coming from? I asked if it would be possible to be moved to another room (believe me, it was THAT bad). The gentleman at the desk told us that nothing else was available because he actually overbooked, and would have to make arrangements for another guest to stay at a nearby hotel. He then realized that he could make that arrangement for us instead and simply give our room to the new guest that would be arriving the next morning. That poor new guest had no idea what he or she would be in for. The gentleman was able to arrange for us to stay at a neighboring hotel, and the Domus Ester paid the difference of 20 Euros. He walked us over to the neighboring hotel, which was a mere block away, and said that we could see the room the next morning and decide if we wanted to stay there instead. I had closed the windows on our room while we were out all of 10 minutes while we were seeing where the other hotel was located. When we returned to our room we literally started gagging because the stench of sewage was so overwhelming and even worse than before because the window was closed for all of 10 minutes. The smell was not coming from the window, but coming from the spacious and newly renovated bathroom, which we can only assume might be due to incorrectly installed plumbing. We opened the window again and held our breath while we slept. Next morning we didn’t even want to shower or go anywhere near the bathroom. We just wanted to leave, and didn’t care what the new hotel would be like because anything would have been better than the Domus Sewer. The woman at the desk was surprised to see us leaving and offered us a new room because someone had cancelled at the last minute that morning. The new room she offered us at the Domus Ester did not smell, but it was directly across from the reception desk (not exactly private) and we just wanted to leave. If it wasn't for the Domus Ester smelly mishap we would not have known about the quiet, clean, contemporary Bed and Breakfast which was like a trendy apartment in the heart of Rome called the “InandOutB&amp;B.” www.inandout-rome.com The In and Out Bed and Breakfast had the best espressos, lattes and croissants we had in any breakfast-included hotel in Italy. We really appreciate that the Domus Ester made a new arrangement, but it is inhumane to expect anyone to endure a smell of sewage strong enough to make them want to leave no sooner than they arrive, let alone expect anyone to pay for it in the first place. We are grateful that they were reasonable and understanding enough to make a new arrangement. I should also make it clear that not all the rooms at the Domus Ester have this problem and maybe they will get the sewage smell corrected in the room we had. If not for the smell, it is a fairly good hotel in an ideal location for experiencing the historic sights and trendy restaurants in Rome.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR37077024">When we arrived at Domus Ester we were quite apprehensive after seeing the outside, a graffiti lined alley, but were pleasantly surprised when we made it up to the hotel (on 2nd/3rd floors of building, no lift but luckily the staff were insistent on carrying our bags for us). It had taken us quite a while to find hotel, the directions on the website are awful and the road wasn't marked on our map, luckily a helpful shopowner pointed us in the right direction! Look it up on Google Maps before you go, also take note of their phone number incase you get lost. The staff were very friendly and helpful, gave us directions/advice, happy to let us leave our bags after check-out. Our room was tiny, barely room to fit both our suitcases but very well decorated, beds were comfy, air con worked well enough and bathroom was clean and looked new. Breakfast was basic but what you expect in Italy, and served in your room as no breakfast room etc. Location was ideal, very close to lots of restaurants/bars and within walking distance to all the main sights (although we were lazy and took a bus to the Vatican). Walls were thin as commented in previous reviews but rarely noticed this, luckily had quiet neighbours!

Only reservation was it was so difficult to locate. I would advise anyone going there to use the hotel's shuttle from the airport, especially if it is dark when they arrive. An added measure is to be familiar with hotel number (dialling code etc.) so you can phone them and they will come and collect you if you are wandering around lost. (hotel's suggestion) Though we had the address and were in the right area no-pne seemed to know where it was, including taxi drivers we asked.

The hotel was pretty standard - I wouldn't call it extraordinary but I can think of far more good things to say about it than bad. The location was great. I walked to Drumheller Fountain (central UW campus) in about 15 minutes and there is a bus stop directly across the street from the hotel with frequent buses that can take you right downtown, where we visited the waterfront and SAM. I think the hotel also has free shuttles until 7 PM but we didn't make use of those. It was an easy walk to the main U District shops/restaurants/thrift stores. The coffee/tea/hot chocolate served all day and mini cupcakes in the afternoon were a nice touch. The complimentary breakfast was pretty standard and a little crowded. There was also a Keurig coffeemaker in our Double Deluxe Queen room along with a fridge and a microwave, which I found to be very convenient for restaurant leftovers. We had a nice window, but the view wasn't anything special. The room and bathroom were about the standard size and quality you would expect and were very clean. The art on the walls was weird and bad but I'm pretty sure that's what hotels are for. The wireless worked great. I had some trouble with the TV in our room losing reception but that was the only real problem I encountered during our stay. Some things about the University Inn were similar to what you'd find at any standard chain hotel for about that price so I'm tempted to say it wasn't anything special, but the service was very good - we had to check out by noon but we couldn't take our stuff to the next place we were staying till the evening and lugging our bags around with us could have ruined our day, but the front desk held our bags for us for no charge and generally the staff seemed really attentive and helpful.

We wondered through the downtown area and had no idea where to stay for the night. After driving by Queen Anne, and Fremont area, we ended up in the U-Dub district. (University of Washington) and at the door steps of University Inn. The front desk was super helpful and friendly, it was a great welcome as we've been driving for many hours before. We got our keys very quickly and had parking on site too. So it was very convenient for everything. The rooms were very comfortable and clean, decor was nice and well done.

It had a certain retro charm to it, especielly in the looby. The room was a bit small as others have noted, but not overly so. The bathroom floor creaked when we walked on it as a floor might in an older home. The shower was roomy and the rest of the orom was comfortable. At first I was concerned about the amount of traffic noise from Roosevelt, but it wasn't a problem at night or in the early morning. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was fairly basic. The one nice surprise was the pineapple cupcakes every night from 3 - 7. The location on Roosevelt was a little tricky depending on where you need to go. Since it is one way, getting back up to the U-District can be a pain, especially in heavy traffic. To get to I-5, cut across Roosevelt to 42nd then turn right on 7th and take it up to 45th. Thankfully itâ€™s easy enough to get *to* the hotel from anywhere in the U-District or I-5, though itâ€™s easy to miss the entrance to the parking area.

The free shuttle was fantastic picking us up right on time and whisking us away to the Space Needle to catch the Duck tour.

I would still reserve early if you are on a tight schedule like we were. We stayed only one night in Seattle. Right next door we ate lunch at the Portage Cafe which had a delicious banana foster french toast..... The toppings bar was LOTS of fresh fruit. I was in heaven. It was very quaint allowing us to eat lunch outside. It was very convenient too being able to walk there from the hotel. Overall, this was a much more affordable option than staying downtown.

There are a lot of other restaurants within walking distance if you don't mind a bit of a hike. But the Portage Bay Cafe next door served my travelling companion the worst breakfast he has ever had.

After trying to book more well known chain hotels with no real luck, I happened on the University Inn after consulting Yelp. We were not disappointed. We were going to visit the usual sites, but the the University Inn, true to its name, is located in the "U-district" near the University of Washington. Not exactly walking distance from the Space Needle and Pioneer Square. As luck would have it, this little gem of a hotel offered a free shuttle to all of the main attractions of Seattle and was willing to try to get you as close to possible to others. You do have to book the shuttle at least an hour in advance, though, so be ready to know where you want to go ahead of time. It also offered a pool and complimentary breakfast. Being from California, we took advantage of the heated pool frequently and the hotel provided fresh "pool towels" on deck as well. The breakfast suited our needs...waffle maker and variety of breakfast foods for most tastes. The evening cupcakes were just OK...they tended to the small size and the kids turned their noses up at the pineapple topping. The staff behind the front desk was for the most part quite helpful, but a few tended to toward the clueless when asked questions that were more in depth about Seattle. Overall though they were helpful and courteous. We tend to be low maintenance when our basic needs are being met. Being in Seattle, the hotel also provided "hotel umbrellas" for guests to borrow in case of inclement weather-another unexpected bonus, though it only sprinkled lightly on us one day out the 7 we were there. The University Inn is sister hotels with the Watertown Hotel, just one block up the street. Though the University does not have workout facilities...always a plus for our active family...guests have access to the basic workout facilities over at the Watertown. You just have to show your room key card to access them. The facilities were spartan, which is always disappointing, but they do have them and we did make use of them. There is no restaurant at the University Inn, but the Portage Bay Cafe is just a couple doors down. Hearty breakfast and lunch fare was a little on the pricey side, but the portions were generous. The Portage Bay Cafe may be owned and run by the same people that run the hotel since I used the cafe's WiFi and it came up as the "University Inn" wifi. Which brings me to my only real gripe....the wifi. If you are going to advertise free wifi then it should always work and it should be compatible with Mac and PC. I could not get online for most of the second day we were there. We wanted to purchase tickets to attractions online, but it proved difficult due to the balky nature of the wifi. The front desk was very NOT helpful telling me that the network sometimes has a hard time with Macs...which is a really lame excuse. They told me that they reset the server, but I was still unable to get online. I am pretty sure that the front desk knew nothing about the network compatibility or when it would come back online. The hotel does have a guest computer in the lobby and I was able to use it to order and print my passes to the Space Needle, but it was REALLY S-L-O-W. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the University Inn. Since we were only staying 2 nites, we were OK with their price point and would recommend it to others traveling to Seattle.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115652266">This is a very clean, decor is retro, and very pleasant.

In the morning, I began to press my shirt collar and it immediately bonded the stuff to my material, ruining the shirt. The management replaced the cost of my shirt immediately, with no questions, in the most respectful way. They never interviewed me about any aspect of my problem, just wanting to make amends. They made a customer of me for life.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR115340926">We stayed here one night on our way back home at the end of a vacation. This is a great hotel that is well managed, very clean and staffed by very friendly people. They also have a free shuttle to to downtown and most major attractions in Seattle. It is also an easy bike ride to downtown. You would be pleased to stay here on business or with family on vacation. You will save money over a downtown location without sacrificing quality and comfort.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113724701">My husband and I travel to Seattle, from the east coast, yearly so I can be treated at a local hospital. What we look for during our annual trips is a quiet place to rest after doctors and tests. This was our third stay for a week at the University Inn (2009, 2010 and 2011) and we were very pleased during our past stays. It is a clean hotel, lots of places nearby to eat, has parking, internet, very friendly staff at the desk, free breakfast. That is all good. However this past visit will be our last. The first night we checked in, our rental car was broken into and trashed--we think it was a homeless person. The rental car had less than 100 miles on it--it was nice, clean, fresh. Very upsetting, taking pictures, filing a police report, trying to clean the urine stench out of the car etc. What was more upsetting, however, was dealing with University Inn management. We were told more than one version of what was seen or not seen on the surveillance tapes, why no action is taken when a car alarm in the parking lot goes off, they did not keep promises as to when management would actually call us back (we got a call 4 days later). But the nail in the coffin was when one of the managers was telling my husband that nothing was seen on the security tape--and then she said to my husband (loud enough so I could hear it from from my husband's cell phone) "WELL SECURITY TAPES DON'T LIE!" I could not believe she would say something that implied we faked a trashed car and our photos--and would be that rude to a guest. It may not be the Inn's fault that our car was broken into, we understand that, but their response is 100% their fault, and being kind and sympatheitic would have gone a long way. They lost us as customers for good.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR113246377">The staff at University Inn were very helpful, and there are nice perks with a stay like free breakfast and a shuttle to the major attractions in downtown Seattle. Surrounding the hotel are also some great restaurants (check out Little Thai and Portage Bay). The rooms are a decent size, as are the bathrooms, but no full length mirrors or even large mirrors in the room. It was three women in the room, so this proved to be an issue. I might stay again, but more for simple convenience.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR109142673">I stayed at the University Inn to attend a conference at UW. The room was splendid and was very clean. The waffles available for breakfast were extremely delicious. One complaint was that the boiled eggs were very cold every morning but besides this the breakfast was great. The seating area for breakfast was a bit small but we managed very well. The hotel provided a free shuttle that took you to Pacific Place and this was very useful to us. At the front desk, Jennifer was very helpful and assisted in making our stay even more comfortable. Overall, this hotel provided great value and service for the cost. We would definitely stay there again!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR106220279">The hotel is really good, rooms are big and confortable as well as the bathroom. Honestly, it was much better than other hotels with higher qualification than 2 stars and a half. The rooms were clean, there is an hairdryer in the bathroom and a coffee machine in the room. Wi-fi internet in the room is compimentary, as well as laundry service in the common area. The service was good, people were never impolite, they help you with what you ask. It is not in the very central zone, but being in the University area means that there are a lot of places to go out for dinner, a coffe or a drink, and the area looked safe. It actually looked much safer tha downtown Seattle. The hotel has a free shuttle service connecting you to both downtown and Seattle center every hour, although it is better to book your place in the shuttle in advance or you risk to have to wait for 1 hour. There is not a very big range of choices for breakfast but it is good. Best: the room and the safe area Least: have to wait for another shuttle (1 hour) to pick me up.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR93672827">I stayed such a long time ago that I won't write a detailed review. However I wanted to mention a couple things and post my pictures because I notice there are not many for people to view. What I can say most about this place is the location. My Grandmother was at the University medical center having heart surgery and we wanted to be close and this was the perfect place to stay. The parking lot was small but we found a place and after we discovered the free shuttle to the hospital didn't need to move the car again. We were also able to walk to a couple places to eat. When the surgery didn't go as expected and we needed to stay another night the front desk staff were very helpful! The room was just ok and the beds not comfortable, but the lack of sleep probably had more to do with our situation that the place itself. The hotel was also 100% smoke free, has a great complimentary breakfast, free internet, and afternoon snacks. These things may have changed since my stay in 08 so please verify. Overall I would recommend!<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="negative" id="UR86574803">The University Inn is walking distance from the U.W. Seattle campus. Walking to and from the school was easy - plus there is a Starbucks and a variety of restaurants along the way. There is free parking at the inn so leave your car behind and walk ... a lot of people do! Continental breakfast in the lobby is nice - you can make your own Belgian waffles or have some fruit, cereal, yogurt. We also like the "breakfast-to-go" option where you can pick up some breakfast items or have them delivered to your room. If you prefer something heartier and have more time (because there's usually a wait), the Portege Cafe has *wonderful* breakfasts - their specialty French toast dishes are absolutely delicious! Our room was on the Roosevelt street side, so it was noisy. The mini-fridge made strange noises as it cycled off and on so we ended up unplugging it at night. The A/C is wall-mounted, so the bed nearest it gets very cold while the other side of the room is okay. The bathroom is standard - one sink and vanity (with the wall-mounted hairdryer) is outside the door with another sink and a large counter space is in the bathroom itself. That makes it convenient for two people to brush their teeth at once. Wasn't crazy about having to hold down the button of the hairdryer to make it work, but maybe it was just that particular dryer. The front office staff is young, helpful and courteous. They were always smiling and welcoming when we returned from our trips to the campus. We liked the big bowl of candy on the counter, too! There is a small laundry room on the lobby level, and the use of the stacked washer and dryer is free for guests! Bring your own laundry detergent and fabric softener. Guests have use of the PC and printer near the front desk - also free. It's great for printing boarding passes or maps/directions to places.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR86003084">We spent 3 nights at the University Inn while touring local colleges, and loved it. The hotel was stylish but comfortable, and the staff was so friendly and helpful. It was also a good value for the $$. We appreciated that the computer and printer were available when we ran into flight &amp; tour issues. We liked being able to walk to University Ave., the campus, and shops &amp; restaurants, and were just a short drive from Seattle's sightseeing highlights.

The University Inn had been recommened to us, so we booked 3 nights there. It was very convenient, had adequate parking and if you didn't want to drive yourself, there was also a shuttle to the hospital. The complimentary continental breakfast each morning was adequate and they even offered an afternoon snack, although we were not around at those times to enjoy it. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The beds were one of the most comfortable we had stayed in recently. Lots of fun restaurants nearby. The staff was very helpful and polite at all times of day.

Upon arrival, you can park your car in the back where there is a big parking lot, but almost all places are taken all the time. You need to put a flyer on your dashboard to make clear you are a visitor staying at the hotel. When entering the room with two beds, it was almost immediately clear that the main problem with the room was the bathroom. It is very very small. To make things worse: the door opens to the bathtub with shower and right in front of you when you enter the bathroom is the toilet, so you have to get in, hardly have any space to close the door and get in the tub. We did not find this very comfortable at all. When going to the lobby to ask for another room, they were very friendly but told us they were fully booked and all rooms in that wing had the same layout. The only thing they could do was move us to the handicapped room, which had a big bathroom, but that could only be arranged for the second night of our stay. And so they did. Room was as big as the first one, but the bathroom was very big, like 4 times the size of the regular room. The rooms are very clean, but there is no special vibe. This could be any hotel anywhere in the world. Breakfast was OK. You can bake your own waffles, toast your muffins, get some cereal, yoghurt, fruit, ... I believe there was also an afternoon snack or drink, but we were out on the town, so missed that. OK hotel, but would not stay here again.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR82515458">We took our son back to the University of Washington and decided to stay at the University Inn.

They provided a nice food selection in the lounge at 5:00 p.m. Fruit, meats, cheeses with crackers. Breakfast was also made available in the moring with a great varity of items.

It appeared that most guests were just that. As for me, I was tagging along with my husband who had business that was not in the U-district. But both my children are college students who live close by to this hotel, so it was a good choice for us. The hotel tries hard to be artsy, upbeat, and, well - boutique-y. It certainly succeeds in the common areas, which are nicely furnished and decorated. The rooms themselves are plain but efficient, clean, and sufficiently stocked. It is not an excessive place, which I like. You get just enough of everything for your needs without being wasteful. There's continental breakfast, which is a plus, given the lower-than-expected nightly rate. Ample free parking, which is a big deal in this tight parking area. Free shuttle service - wow! All in all, a good value for an urban hotel. OK, so the urban part: location is not the very best, a tad seedy. Close to the freeway.

The hotel was very clean, offered free evening cheese and crackers, and a great continental breakfast (fresh Belgian waffles!). Our room had a nice little balcony, which was perfect for the cool September evenings during our stay. They even offer a free shuttle that will take you from the hotel to downtown Seattle. We didn't use it (we had a rental car), but I was impressed that it was offered. The pool looked great, although it was a little chilly to give it a try while we were there. The parking is secluded, well-lit and safe, so no worries there either. The University of Washington is a few blocks to the east from the hotel.

After booking our 2 rooms online, I realized that I screwed-up the reservation, and could have gotten a lower rate for the same room. A call to the hotel desk fixed the problem without a fuss. We found the University Inn was a little cheaper than the Watertown, but still a very nice hotel, with nice furnishings in the lobby and the rooms. One of our rooms had a nice view of downtown, one had a view of Mt Rainer. Our rooms were spacious and well maintained. The AC in one room was a little noisier than we would have preferred. We had requested an early check-in, but there were no rooms available. The staff helped store our 7 large bags so we could return later. The free breakfast was slightly above average. The fresh waffles were a big hit. Our room had a good WiFi signal. It was an easy 4 block walk to the university area and it's assortment of pubs and shops. However, walking to that area ensured encounters with vagrants. This is our 3rd visit to Seattle, and the vagrant problem was bad everywhere we went.

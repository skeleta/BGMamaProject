Edit, fill, the cars are standing almost to the entrance and apparently did not know about the underground parking people. The hotel is good, the Spa nothing particularly, I miss hot sample topilo. Who wanted to soak in the swimming pool, this is the place, writes that is 32 degrees, and 30 is, well, it's not a temperature for swimming, I'm sorry. Last night I was on my way to the restaurant and I ... Hr Smirnenski, noo, I saw that one my favorite diner and it was dead and buried already. The last two years pass by and still closed, it turns out that works only in the evening. It's about Bakoto, right next to the entrance of the hotel Kleptuza. Prices as of the previous comment on, normal portions, tasty fries are not blanched, and hand-peeled potato, Rodopi is just not worth eating in the hotel. The place is a little 6-7 tables, so either booking or earlier need to sit there.</comment><comment category="negative" id="29914897">evhen, thanks for the information ... and how is the food?

Set to leave in early February. This time I'm going on vacation-i.e. without a child. In view of this fact, I hesitate between D D this time I'm looking for just that. Also I think I'm going to say some spa package with includes. procedures.    Quite fresh impressions of St. Spas, from this week. The hotel is very large, with a spacious lobby, a lobby bar, and a restaurant with a large green garden, with glazed and heated part. The rooms are large 24 m2, unlike other hotels in velingrad (eg. Akvatonik), with a sufficiently large terrace equipped with a towel rail and a great view. Extra bed is big enough. Bathroom-clean, with bath, equipped with everything you need for your stay. Bathrobes-loaded are in the room, including children, if you have requested in advance. No deposit will be charged for their use. Food (since we were HB package) is delicious and no type salami Kamchia or similar. Coffee for breakfast, unlike most hotels, that's fine. To note also that the prices in the restaurant are high-3.00 EUR little BG, drink, 4.00 EUR sup. One night the staff screwed up-can we stop the waiter to order two drinks and one woman whose fight for child sup. The next night, another team was working, I have no words-great service loaded tables and food. Swimming pools-one big swimming, one less divided into two-the children's sector, another sector with greater depth and Jacuzzi-32-35 degrees. Were clean. There was a permanent presence of the Saviour, a woman cleaning every day until noon. Even had replacement belts for children. Enough and the sun loungers. The steam bath and the sauna are in the same sector-quite large and warm 44-45 degrees. Don't forget-the hotel has two elevators for the spa and separate two elevators for restaurants and hotels, that is going to a restaurant not seeing people in bathrobes. The spa area is very large, many rooms for massages, baths, etc. I note that the Spa DOESN'T SMELL of humidity and channel and is very clean and Nice. I think it's important to know that the hotel has an underground heated parking. I think I was sufficiently comprehensive and vote for St. Spas. </comment><comment category="negative" id="29922927">Hi, I see that the topic is for hotels, but I want to share an opinion about Guest House. It is located in Ravadinovo and says Villa Ravadina ush is categorized into 2 stars, but....... I want to tell you how I got there. decided to go to the recently popular Castle in Ravadinovo, and as we are from Varna decided to sleep in the village when I searched the Web a place to shelter the best cottage was normal for the village of the night was 10 BGN As the Lady call me to explain how she was going to go to Burgas to take his grandchild and is booked. We arrive and after 20 min. questioning how we as we are and what we do here, we headed for the room-ooootvrat, smells like a filthy toilet, unclean muhal, really cold (beginning of September) where we could Cook and eat nepod″ržana was in a dirty garden covered with natorii, irons, parts, tyres, etc. and the grandchild was there and our 2 nights falling ears. ... the only good thing was that from our window we could see the Castle, which is illuminated at night and so beautiful. But if you want to visit the Castle and you are from far away do not recommend you to stay there. A good option is. :)</comment><comment category="negative" id="29922965">  evhen, I would appreciate it if you share the impressions of the children's corner, that I read somewhere that there was a large inflatable trampoline.   Otherwise, there now is there snow? About how it is for walking?    My child is great, I can't really say about the children's corner, but apart from the Center to the tv I saw another great children's Center (at least so it seemed to me) directly opposite the entrance of the restaurant. The kids who were really already running between the Centre and the parents who are hapvaha in the restaurant. A very convenient one. The doors were opened and I saw a boy, it was an animator. There is a trampoline in the yard, but I'm not sure at the moment can be used. Snow in the city, not in the garden, Bluegrass is a little snowbound. Saint Spas is located in the pretty dank place to me and great care must be taken when entering by road.</comment><comment category="positive" id="29923889">Hotel Fairy-Estate   </comment><comment category="negative" id="29924479">ketka111, thank you so much for the comprehensive response.

Good day no, it's not a buffet. All feed is set menu. Every morning there was a compl of 1 egg, some olives, ham, cheese, yellow cheese, tomato, 1 packet of sweet bread. Buttermilk and coffee with milk. (The ham wasn't pretty). Every day was different from the way French toast kompleto, Granola, muffins with chocolate patties, omelets and I think it is.  Filter coffee in the jug, but really it was some water. The good thing is that the rooms have refrigerator and if you are with young children can take some things. We have a lot of fruit.  We're not hungry were standing, but we ordered other things. For dinner, convenience meals are delicious, Grill, cheese and breaded cheese too, but don't take breaded schnitzel breaded and whitefish. Dude from stinking of only soybean and who knows what. Dessert included also were not bad.   We have not been in velingrad and pleasantly surprised that the prices are normal everywhere. Had lunch at different locations and we ordered from the lunch menu, we paid the $ 10-15 with a drink for three. She usually little SUP and parlenka. The pool is between 32 and 34 degrees, but rather in the days in which we were was 33. For us it was cool. Regular guests of the hotel were told that before was in hot water.  Budget hotel "Jeri" is a very nice hotel, the prices are normal. There's always more, but one judge with which to compromise at the expense of price.</comment><comment category="negative" id="29925918">Please, if anyone has any fresh impressions of Olympus to share:)</comment><comment category="positive" id="29927475">Hi!

Maybe they are new, I don't know how it was before, we were there for the first time.  And one more thing about the famous dressing gowns are thinner, i.e. not Terry, but I don't think that is a problem because the whole hotel was very warm. </comment><comment category="negative" id="29928143">  Therma Palace in kranevo:)   For!!!</comment><comment category="positive" id="29928816">Hi, some time I've been following the thread and I personally am not found reviews for Hotel Now. Once at the last minute, we decided that this weekend will go to Velingrad and couldn't find seats in hotels that normally visit harbor for Now. Today are back from there and I share my impressions. The hotel is a new, Nice furnished, warm and clean. The rooms are zaredene with bathrobes.  The Spa is small, but the hotel is family-run. There are classic sauna and steam bath, that worked. The internal pool is with a water temperature of around 30-32 degrees and children section in which the water is the same temperature. There is a Jacuzzi with a lot more hot water in my opinion around 38 degrees. The outdoor pool also worked, but there the water was colder around-26-28 degrees. I have personally used it. The hotel restaurant has a pleasant interior, but prices and prices of competing four petzvezdite hotels in the city. For example give the BG brandy 50 ml. At Now-3.50 EUR, at Royal Spa-4.00 EUR, at Maxi-4.00 EUR, at Aquatonic, do not remember exactly, but certainly under 3.50. Bead soup from the lunch menu-3.90 EUR Another hotel in velingrad with excessive prices at the restaurant. The quality of the food did not comment on it, because we are very, very fickle and my opinion probably won't become obsolete. After this weekend with MM have decided it is better to visit big hotels, at least to take advantage of their large and diverse spas. </comment><comment category="negative" id="29929123">Thank you for your opinion about Hotel Now, I have long fancied him, but would not have resorted to booking there shared account.

Visit this hotel, as I said, and the child if the base breakfast, I don't see how unless they give you a free dinner. And your site says, as most hotels-child to Hicks years stays free bed and breakfast.  I'm very fond of the service, in addition to the basic requirements for my hotels that get there, specifically, I dare say that I served at a very high level and all my whims are satisfied, whether you asked for more towels, sheets, pillows or blankets.  Fix my child's bed after you settle the food is very delicious, fresh, and I didn't see any bad salami, no substitutes-type fancy cheese, yellow cheese or margarine instead of butter, specially made this work, because of the previous comment of a lady who claimed to have served for the replacements.  The Spa is quite large for the capacity of the hotel, I don't know what you have for the present capacities of their relevant hotels and spas, but I visit other hotels and most have more capacity, not to mention double and less SPA-pool, saunas and massage cabins and need to record hours of procedures before you go because if I decide to spontaneously get some massage , I'm going to have to wait in pools you exchange bodily fluids with far more people because of that difference in capacity.  Not to mention the story in a very upscale hotel where I had to jump in the pool with her clothes to draw the child because there was no Savior. </comment><comment category="positive" id="29931802">Augusta in Hosarâ and Husain in velingrad</comment><comment category="negative" id="29931809">For the animation in St.spas to tell you, I talked to the girls, weekends, during holidays and school vacations coming up an outside company. Friday starting from 15.00 17.00, or I didn't get Saturday's all-day, Sunday at noon. During the day are more peaceful games, there's creative activities, board games, drawing, are more active at night-musical games, children's disco, complete with movie from 21.00 hours.  On my like a second grader, after 6 hours I on Saturday afternoon until late in the evening. But there is a big however, the hotel is great during the week, but don't do it on the weekends, it's crowded, clean in pools is now a mirage, the lounge chairs are insufficient, with the two words I do not recommend.</comment><comment category="negative" id="29931860">And check to see if the animation is not paid. Once us surprised us so uncomfortable. It was announced that during the two days there will be an animation (at intervals of some hours), but nowhere is it was announced that an outside company and is paid for. The child came into the gym (there was an inflatable trampoline and some tables), game (ONLY; available two entertainers were sitting on the side without dealing with children) and when I went to get it sûrpriziraha me with a huge amount in the range of $ 25. (it was at dinner). I naturally did not expect because it was announced that no payment was made (though is a 5-star hotel would), nor what the price was, and money. I wanted to put them on the Bill of the room. Could not because they had an outside company. In addition, for example, they charged three hours and the child in no case was there so-enter, then come to dinner, then go again, then ran to the lobby ... evhen in my humble opinion this applies to all works. During the week is a paradise for holidaymakers, weekend hell from the crowd.</comment><comment category="negative" id="29932044">Bliss, avoiding weekends is principle number 1 to me, however this hotel is po-adsko by everywhere, I looked now, the difference in their prices on the weekends is minimal, their pricing policy for kids is a wonderful and full of 100% Saturdays and Sundays, I don't want to go into details about the nasty stuff   </comment><comment category="negative" id="29932264">It's driving me mad that I wrote. It's like you're making it up, and believe it or not, I have no reason to do it. And I do not see how, but on the phone told us that what we offer. At check-in they gave us tickets for the child, and they said we could order anything we choose. And the Spa is really a little. I've been to 3 star, with a rather larger saunas and steam baths. Anyway, I will write more.</comment><comment category="negative" id="29932545">Dae, ordering whatever you decide to order does not mean free. Specifically, I looked at the site, it says in black and white on what basis are accommodated children and what is free and there is no dinner referred to and my surprising how you decided that if you order whatever you want, it means free. Means free consumption, which means quite another.  I haven't been very 3 star, at the expense of 4 and 5 star not only in Bulgaria, and not only in velingrad and I don't think it is a little bit about the capacity of the hotel and the Spa is not just a sauna, and the entire water park, which includes swimming pools, anything that involves water and water treatments. And I say that without claim for hotel expert, only on the basis of customer and repeat, in 5 star hotels on weekends I reserve times for procedures together with the reservation, because it's spontaneous.  The food is also pretty fucking weird, obviously in my visits delivered fresh, delicious and fresh food, and for your-jammed. And I mean not just a post I wrote a while back, and a lady said that breakfast products were substitutes-the cheese is not cheese, and substitute, and there was no oil there, margarine and so forth, which also does not correspond to the truth, and that with simple words is called a lie and slander.  I'm not going to argue if I wasn't there, I didn't, but given that regularly visit the hotel similar posts sound very close to libel, rather than adequate reviews of client.  And that, for the simple reason that comment on the hotel, who personally visit with my daughter, I don't have to believe or not to believe, I have impressions of the first person, yet that I can bet I'm picky customer that pays claims, however.  Never have to write that one hotel was bad, because I did not know on what basis it settles my child or in the room there was no towels, which, in no way believe it.    </comment><comment category="negative" id="29932717">This expressly said for free. I understand very well. Please, don't tell me what I know and what is not. Believe it or not, and if you don't. It was on the phone, they told him, and the front desk. The offer, which was offered on the phone, not through the site. And Yes, the Spa is a little. Crowded, sauna, steam bath, pool and only 4/four/benches in the large spa.</comment><comment category="positive" id="29932786">Thanks, sisitons!   </comment><comment category="negative" id="29932934">And I wonder where to go at the beginning of March-in Velina have available apartments in Hissar which Hotel do you recommend?</comment><comment category="positive" id="29932977">  Thanks, sisitons!

Otherwise, instead of writing on forums that had towels in the room of the 4 star hotel, if you were confirmed the reservation, with full feed the child, including the front desk, I wonder why you haven't raised the question because it would be an appropriate behavior in the case, not to tell me šeherezadi that I had towels in the room which I most strongly, cheer me up in an overall attempt to comment on the hotel.  For pool and SPA-I'm not going to comment on it, and you can see in the pictures with the naked eye and the pools will not dematerializirat with our small talk and anyone who wants to see them and to determine whether it satisfies or not.  In General, I don't see the point to explain more, I don't read the posts for the first time for hotels and not at all difficult to judge when a comment is appropriate and when-not when a customer is informed about what paid and what should get as a service against payment and the category of the hotel, which he attended.</comment><comment category="positive" id="29933197">  Would you recommend a hotel in the Village-with hot pools and good service!

Overnight stay with breakfast and dinner for two-80-100 euro. I don't know if there's a cheaper Hotel Once I was in writing and confirm Selekta. Horrible food, bad service, it is not a big deal. Even had, almost, to ask them to place the sauna and steam bath. Lakonium regular use wasn't working. I don't even know have you ever worked who returns from there, says he has not worked: ooooh I fully support what you wrote about the hotel itself. And to top it all at departure/what it was early in the morning on a Sunday because I had resisted more/we are Trump with the cost. Because we booked through a booking we thought cracked in some rural rate close to 2 leva. I'm 5 leva, but we wanted to pay in euros, but we refused and that was their mistake. MM, as they were called, picked up all of cheer, so I ended up waking the Manager on the phone. He told them everything we thought about them and come to see their faces.

If someone has visited the hotel and there are direct observations, let him write to me specifically for Elbrus package is not worth it.  Prices in the restaurant are normal and you have a choice of food. Just as a landmark-dinner for two-2 small drinks, two salads (standard, i.e. with a larger weight than those in the package), two Grills (no matter what) or combined Sach, bread, a bottle of mineral water comes out a total of about 40lv. What I saw in the masses of the people who were with the Pack was a small shopska salad, a pot or kebabs with garnish fried potatoes and some kind of dessert. You choose. This budget hotel is not bad, but the last time I visited it was observations on the pools. Somewhere above I wrote. And don't forget-if you choose a holiday during the week, because it is crowded on weekends.    Thanks for the info, unfortunately I couldn't find anything about the pools, but you'll probably book a BB during the week.</comment><comment category="positive" id="29967708">http peace:</comment><comment category="negative" id="29967949">    Since you raised the subject of hotel select, to tell you our impressions.

The price of the breakfast, the only use of the indoor swimming pool. He was warm, but no children's section. There are outdoor playground, Indoor playground. For food to order every day if you want comfort food. To the price to be paid and in the 1.22 EUR per day adult/child tax. This is what I was able to learn. It was still early for reservations in May. In March, at least specify the lass. I'm writing this, if anyone's interested. And if another is gone or there is more up to date information on this basis, which I understand was renovated two years ago, let him write.     We went, it's not.

I can't appreciate it as a SPA Hotel, which I assume that they are interested in, and not as a new year's Eve performance.  The rooms are nice. There is a waste and inconvenience in the bathroom. No bidet, which few people excited about them, but I think that in a 4 star hotel, is a very aspirational.  There's a clothes dryer on the terrace, which make me a very good impression. Heated by air conditioning units and if you want, you can make the room sauna. The restaurant is ice cold. If the baking Sun during the day is not felt, but the night is a nightmare. That summer I have a problem with its cooling because of the large floor-to-ceiling Windows.  The sun loungers around the pool while we were there we went.  There is an indication in the bathrooms, that if you wish to change the towels and robes, you must leave them on the floor as a sign.

A wide variety of salads and desserts, you just don't think something was there. Also the breakfast was very rich and the cheeses and charcuterie were of good quality and not pull numbers like other places. Staff was extremely polite, for the first time and welcome us with our divorce through the hotel to show us where it is located and led us to a room, and not like most places give you the key and go through lutaj mazes.

We were there for 2 nights with my family, as we were taken 3 rooms. This is a family-run hotel, in an area with interesting sights, with a nice view. As a whole is pretty clean, the hotel is relatively new and very, very warm. There is heating in the whole building, and a separate air conditioners everywhere. Nice indoor pool with Spa, there is a bathrobe, towels, slippers. And it also has radiators and air conditioners and is very suitable for cold days, especially if you are with children. Me and my friend and I were seated in a room, located on the top floor and in fact only on the floor. Unlike other rooms, where there were showers, we were, and we had a balcony, which had no other newsm10 here everything perfectly. And here are the reasons why it set in this list. Narrator, it turns out that we only have 6 channels (although their website said that there is a cable tv). We didn't have a range of phones and we didn't have the Internet (again, as it said on the site). On request at the reception turned out to our last 4th floor, no Internet signal, because there are rarely housed people and, in the case the hotel was full. For the kitchen and the service in the restaurant also cannot give a very high score. Some of the food were delicious, but not others, and in the case there's nowhere else close by to eat and you don't have a choice. And secure and for this reason, and the prices were a little higher, and the service from our waitress wasn't much, at times even a little presumptuous. Separately, after our first night spent there, we noticed a discrepancy in the prices on the menu and on the receipt, which had given us, and quite often they told us a different price for the same thing. Like their other minus I can report is that there's some corner or area for leisure. The only place was the restaurant where we were sitting one afternoon, despite the inconvenience, because the staff was loading tables for the evening and their prečihme. And once in the room we had no Internet, and tv coverage of the parts, it was the only place where we had the opportunity to use them. As another note is that they don't have any activities for children, such as a room or Hall, and there were a lot of children. Overall, I can't say that I had a good time, too, but there were definitely things I couldn't feel excellent, need to feel their guests, according to me     </comment><comment category="negative" id="30049764">Hi, can you please tell me how is the road to Velingrad at the moment. </comment><comment category="negative" id="30049910">  Hello to all who follow the subject, Please Select Hotel feedback on exactly how is the pool, the rooms are wide.

The hotel is very well heated up too much, so, who plans to visit him in the coming months, could get away with only summer clothes:-). On weekends there is animation for children. It was interesting to children up to 10-12 years, there is a treasure hunt, and painting to children's disco. Entertained them from 18.00 to 22.00. And what for us was the biggest plus, there was a babysitter in the kid's corner, which could leave his little girl of 1 year and relax to enjoy the Spa-Center. The children's play area is for children up to about 8-9 years, but with preserved toys, there's even a trampoline. The pool is about procedures, do not expect that it can swim. The temperature is pleasant, I don't know exactly how much, but it was neither cold nor very hot, the individual had a little water with radon topilo 40. Going for a swim, but otherwise the massage nozzles are great, and akvaaerobika in the morning.  There is also an outdoor swimming pool, which is divided into 2 parts, one with hot water, the other is cold.  Spa for us was OK, there was a Roman bath, a relaxation room, adventure shower, Finnish and infrared sauna, I must be missing something. Massages and a Turkish bath for an additional fee, as well as fish massage against a £ 10 for 30 min. For older children there was a Hall with simulation games (and I don't know what). The prices I saw high-$ 10 for 5 min.  The food was also very well prepared. And the breakfast and dinner buffet were organized by t. k. it was full of 100%, it was prigodili one of the Conference halls of the restaurant during those meals, so there are no queues. Prices of drinks during dinner were relatively normal. The price of lunch at the restaurant of the hotel it was around 2p″ti higher than in a pub outside the hotel, but it was delicious.

We've reserved a few days ago on the phone non 10 adults and 7 children, as agreed with the manager about the number of rooms and the price of the stay, room and breakfast. On arrival the first thing we found is that one of the rooms was not preserved, requiring the placement of our friends at another hotel/well that there were places. In the morning we were all UNPLEASANTLY surprised after it turned out that for breakfast have to talk again with the missing Governor, the complex offers food with pay, which is not included in the room rate, which does not correspond to the prices on the site of the complex. By the way, mom made food gas rings, the restaurant part and service staff are nervous that us nervous. The owner turned out to be not a man of his word, continue to accommodate, although there was no electricity, and I told them no, generally unethical person.   After a second day without electricity, we decided to leave, what we called the Manager and asked him if he could leave the luggage in the room or elsewhere, or to get him. He allowed us to let him in, but on condition that you take him to a least 5 pm. This suited us and we decided to go without the kids to the lodge. Forty minutes after we were on our way to the cabin kids began to ring of fire because the Governor threatened them to kick them out of the room or if they will have to pay for accommodation. Running and worried in the complex went down in naložitelniâ after 16.40 conversation with the Manager and he swore at us. The food at the restaurant is a little complex to put honey-chicken soup and tripe-3,50lv., coffee-3,00lv.

The swimming pool is with acceptable temperature for prolonged stay and has a children's section, where their children swam alone. There is also a Jacuzzi with hot water, but I smelled of chlorine in it. The sauna and the steam bath are OK to use in the afternoon, but were still in the morning cool.  In the Aquatonic was warm, clean, our room was spacious-with a bedroom and a sofa bed. The lobby also has a fireplace, but somehow you feel uncomfortable to stay up late there.

Every day exported almost the same foods, but are so numerous that you can still eat different things every day. The pool was warm and very densely populated, it was soup.

Very warm rooms, clean, except for the muh″lčeto over the Windows (probably because we were the next to the last floor and becomes condensate). Breakfast-standard. I'd say with enough varied, seasonal fruit. Coffee is a machine, but it works. Dinner is also a smorgasbord, may enter into or offer to pay anything for 14 EUR per person. Quite varied as proposals, but also quite hungry people hurrying to complete plates that will not eat. Doplaŝahme for two nights, two dinners were waiting to leave the hungry multitude and sit normally on free consumption. What tastes better and it was nice to sit down and order, instead of rushing to the table that you are exhausted. Otherwise, there are two restaurants charge equally.  There is a children's play room and boys-entertainment staff, who play with the kids. Make every night children's disco, becomes quite happy and fun (and loud). Then place film of Taming:)  SPA-zone only went to look at it, I'm not sitting. Don't whip up from 28-30 degree pool or sauna. My husband said that the water is pretty chlorinated, and really anyone coming out of the pool smelled plenty of chlorine.  With busčetata and I didn't understand it, the receptionist did not deem it necessary to inform us, and we never asked. I just went to the lift, which is a 5 min with normal and 10 minutes to the ski boots.

And the road. horrible, dirty, great snow tracks, even with the chains we were unable to reach the hotel. 50 metres from the hotel in the rain and snow had to go back and look for the 2-year-old kid where to leave your car. But the tractor stood in front of the hotel. Horrified, wet with all luggage, no one bother to make sure to clean up the snow. Then it turned out that up to the middle of the night in the restaurant screw up such a loud music, you can't sleep. Despite the remarks at 1 o'clock in the morning, the music continued and in the coming days. The restaurant 5-6 persons are krivâha, and the entire hotel was full of children. Again at 2 and 30 hours of hassle, but alas without result. The reservation was the answer that there were people who want music. Tell us what you do in that case? Where can a man complain. ...

In spite of all the negative reviews, we chose the Roâa and to the surprise stand-in. Why, because I wasn't paying attention to the guests if you poke around in the nose or plates, fill or enter with chains and flip-flops in the sauna spa area is so great that nobody interferes, even in swimming pools. All I can say is the best Spa in velingrad. The staff was kind and patient with the guests that first step of such a place, and there were quite a few. I don't see why I should comment, everyone has the right to try everything, right???? We arrived on a Sunday and the front desk was crazy, but nevertheless they took our luggage to the room through the hotel, our divorce. There was a lot of nervous people with claims and continued to wait and whimper. Well, if you arm yourself with patience and 5 minutes you get attention and respect the food at the restaurant was good and varied, even on a blog. We were not with vaulčeri, but nevertheless we decided to have dinner there. There were plenty, 3 types of meats, salads, entrees for every taste, fruit in abundance. We visited several iconic restaurants, well I can only say decent, working with old glory, a taste of the level of the grand piano.  We are a people who love diversity and therefore always choose different hotels. Price offerings in the piano's sound. I forgot to add an excellent Wi-Fi in every area of the hotel.

The room was very cozy, wood, warm ... a King-size bed, comfortable. We were on the ground floor, the terrace out of a large veranda, space ... I noticed that there wasn't ANY zaredni supplies. T. k. SOAP and shampoo are in vending machines and no soaps, sewing kit separately, but there was no Hat hair, cotton buds, etc. and I didn't ask, I wear mine, usually. The Spa has no connection with the rooms, so if we were with child, a great dressing and undressing was going to fall. I was wearing a robe and towels, and there I was stripping. The premise is as Rotunda, warm, with stone slabs on the floor, warm. IE and barefoot walk is nice and not slippery. There is a large sauna, steam bath, aroma grotto, somewhat similar to a sauna, a Jacuzzi, a relaxation room, and various treatment rooms. very warm a shallow soaking pool with massage jets and a bit cool for swimming, with hydro-massage beds and pool bar. The restaurant-maaalko, expensive but acceptable. Breakfast-and more-a la carte-option 1 2 baked toast with ham and cheese or 2 French toast or yogurt with Granola. Well, that man was going on this trip not to be olivame with the meal, so don't fret. One morning at 7 and something awakened screaming peacocks that circling around the complex.

It put us not at all. The food is like everywhere else, eat, not hungry. There was no impressive dishes, but nablâgahme of salads.    For dinner, no drinks included, but prices are not high. Lower than in pubs around. For example: peace out from the hotel, down the stairs in the White House, down the steeply downwards and out of the car. That makes the ski, it is not necessary to wait for the bus or etc. transport. Could walk to go there.

Don't go there. Located in the immediate vicinity of the hotel and hotel Xtreme Mursalica countryside. We were there for one night on 14 February. This is our second and last visit there. We were booked in advance, with included breakfast and dinner. Ensconced in our room without tv, refrigerator, kitchenette, even water glasses were gone. We asked you to provide us with a tv or to move to another room, but the answer to the woman at the front desk was that not all rooms in the hotel have a tv, provided only for TVs longer stays. The hotel is categorized with 3 stars and it is absurd to explain that there are no TVs in all rooms, provided that the site is noted that offers cable and satellite television, kitchenette and other goodies. They refused and another provided that all around us were empty and it was just for one night. The unpleasant impressions I ended up here. In our restaurant ensconced in a side room with the explanation that the Central Hall is for external guests with reservations and prepaid dinners we have in this room, provided that the food is served on the menu, and is not a buffet. The room was relatively warm, but in the hallway to the room there is no heating, as well as in the corridors of the floors. I am extremely appalled by conditions in the hotel, the service, they ruined our holiday and didn't even apologized for the inconvenience. We don't have tall claims, but we expect elementary conditions such as a tv and a fridge, as described in the site of the hotel. In our previous lodging in this hotel also had problems, the room was not cleaned, settling and we need to clean up after you did it.

However, I really wonder at such people-to go alone with a baby without a man, obviously, winter, mountain, where do you hope to have the snow, with unreliable car/other car went by and this one does not, apparently, don't wear/chains and all the way up the mountain to think of, you might need to return urgently, if something happened to the baby. and you're mad at me, why nobody stops to help you and all that you are guilty.  I went in this hotel many times-it's a compromise, the furniture is old and dinky, but its main advantage was that the rooms were warm and had unlimited hot water. We stayed in the apartments as well as in the rooms. The rooms are decent, but it was flat and in no way dirty we pass the maid. The Maliovitsa there are other places with better living conditions, but do not have any common areas and our kids had nowhere to congregate and play, that's why we like the hotel. For the prices of the hotels-each judge yourself, but combined with the low prices of skiing and rope is obtained as soon as possible niskobûdžetnata ski vacation.

The food was tasty but not the best quality products-just the Cook doing his job perfectly, but IT was still one-third of the current price. Cleanliness in the hotel is good, although we were at the closed wing then exceptionally because of the hiring of a two bedroom apartment as the main and only went with us to throw out trash cans. For five days they changed the sheets and poizmetoha once again. Otherwise, in wing and main public areas very clean and warm. The pool was cold for us, but we love the warmer waters and 29-30 degrees it is lukewarm. And with three small children who do not gamble to shower there. Otherwise, it's clear, the sauna and the steam bath-OK. Last worked on medium degrees, I don't know how it is now.

What can I say, it was built with buildings in the round and where it is relatively nanmira, it looks like the monastery and in the middle there is a fontančeta and flower gardens with animals walking freely there are deer, peacocks, rabbits, and one-stop decorative chickens. In the middle is the outdoor pool and across the street is the domestic, which is a new and very large, the mineral water is of Krasnovo and is from 2 years, water is 36 degrees, the summer heated it even further. In addition to the great indoors, which is with stone benches and a small Jacuzzi type has 6 or 8 with Jacuzzis, heated, also has a steam bath, sauna and outdoor Jacuzzi and pool. I think there is no connection but are 10 metres from almost all the rooms of the complex, there are bathrobes, Kalina Malina and mineral water baths. Living in the complex, there is a lunch menu with organic foods mainly bread, otlimec and prepared meals, there is juice of buzz, delicious, gourmet, a little pricey, noooo it's still relaxing. For dinner we ate there again, have a unique dekupažno wine on tap that only in the Tavern has it, we liked the white trout, Pan also loved us or whatever you want, but the bread should try. I will have a Royal, the pool is a unique, larger and nicer I can not point out, there is also a wet bar, but summer wasn't working, only this out it was open to the outdoor swimming pool. The mineral water is of Krasnovo and brought by 10 km I think, maybe more, farmers are the Russians.

I like it this hotel and it's for this price is awesome. He summer is even cheaper, if you use three nights there are discounts for big apartment and is $ 106, which is super cheap for three rooms. If you have a close family with him to go to a large apartment. And yet another extra 20% discount in the restaurant). That's three years in a row for this I don't know. And another thing, don't tease me no weekday, no holiday, one price, you better not have changed it. Most hotels that piss me off weekend prices here at 6.09, or 22.09 always is the same price as usual. I around those dates, it's my birthday and I'm taking my wife and kid to buy, always make super. Last year I booked in ognyanovo Darwish and I wasn't satisfied, cold pools, and for the first time I see a smorgasbord with a bland meal, cooked badly, what were these people I don't know, nothing to eat. Well, that Villa paradise is up to them and with incredible cuisine.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30271310">      Read about Grand Hotel Bansko more forward in the topic good reviews, but they sent a confirmation of the booking is a mess, nor has the dates for which I'm reserved, no additional requirements such as, for example, that the beds are twin, nor for the child on additional bed or on a regular basis, so stupid, so I only see the total amount and this is for the first time happened to me something like that. Give advice where it's best for accommodation in the building itself as a floor and Vista, otherwise I'm going to write to send a more detailed written everything it is clear.      Best in the building that it is the best. Ask for a better forward view, though how much time you will spend in the room. And the upper floor. Otherwise, do not send confirmation, but calling a week before.  Otherwise, their only double beds, the child does not know. We have no children.  Just a note--drinks during dinner not included.    Thanks, I have a little more time to think, I hope, if you do go there, no problems, good reviews on the hotel, I hope you are real.    Go without worries in the Grand Hotel, nice, you won't regret it, we've been there several times. I just don't like that don't have a garden, with outdoor café where you can sit with a cigarette, for example ...:) from the lobby bar make three or four tables, AMO it is on the street in front of the hotel, the Spa is unique, must visit it.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30271321">  Then how can I reach her?

But I never got around to the cold room until now, I guess I'm really lucky. The last time the new wing wanted to seat us in an almost underground, which was with a radiator.  Otherwise--in the new wing, there is no difference in standard and luxury, but in the middle there. Hey, there is much to be desired. But the Spa really is okay, the water is warm, and the SPA.   Frankly, I'm sure there are better hotels (except the Kempinski), but not my experiment. One time we went to a Trinity, and we left a day earlier.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30273259"> In St. There are two swimming pools spas-deep and shallow + Jacuzzi. Two shallow sections. In the shallow end for children, including the very young. Mine is a 2 years and was OK. The deepest part is about three feet, maybe. Ideal for nepluvaŝi. The pools are hot.  The hotel I got a lot of comments in relation to the price-quality, but it's not essential, and fapiraŝo. We've been to much better places for less money.  The food was good and sufficient. Again comparing with other buffets, this sucks. But there are two-three kinds of fresh salads, so again as Russian winter salads and the like, several types of meat, cooking and two or three things on the side. Several kinds of desserts. Prices in the restaurant are unreasonably expensive. The drinks are paid.  Children's corner is against the restaurant. Spacious enough with slide, House, toys. When the shift is a young man inflates the trampoline and the kids having fun. When are girls gone that extra. Evening announced movie night and play movie, young children bored.   At the Royal Spa has shallow pools. In the Elbrus. Royal however is usually full, which for me is a big minus. In St. Spas was freely. </comment><comment category="positive" id="30273891">Riu Pravets lags from 2012 onwards, especially the Spa, for more than a year is not the Victoria Spa. The rooms are badly in need of repair, or are large, which is nice. The swimming pool is big and beautiful, but quite cold lately. The food is great, the nature also. A big advantage is that it is close to Sofia, which visit him often with my daughter for the holidays. Their policy is not to be paid for a child up to 12 years is great.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30274212">Girls, we were at Anchor, Germaneâ and Emali. At last I sent you.

No bathrobes, pay an extra $ 4 is of use. They changed the sheets after the scandal. Though the room is 80 EUR and it is not at all a little bit. In Germaneâ rooms are twice as big, overnight for apartment was $ 75 living room with two single beds and a sofa bed and a separate bedroom no transition, breakfast is poorer, but the kitchen is cheap and delicious, if anyone says otherwise then I don't eat there. It's hot in the rooms, really for me it did not drawback, the furniture is not something special, but good. Lavazza coffee is and is very nice, have a new indoor pool and Jacuzzi but I haven't seen him yet. There is a nice outdoor, in such Emali.

Another place is a village bath, Roman bath and Akvilon Hotels, but again I did not see the vessels, may be a Akvilon in both places have kitchens in apartments again, however. I don't know about the rooms. Another place is Dobrinishte and there is a mountain, it is 15 km from Bansko, and there are places with kitchens, but we've been in Orbel Spa and I think there wasn't.

You know what is being done mostly in hotels. Between absorption for water-resistant plates has no insulation and the like. Problem is with young children.

There was a woman in the children's corner down to the Spa, which looked at children of 10-18.30, and animation for older children starting from 17.00-18.00 with a break for dinner from 19.00-20.00, 22.00 and it was great fun. The food also very good, free consumption including. The hotel is extremely nice and warm all over.  It's nice that the pools are hot, but come a little small when complete hotel, almost anytime.

Don't go there!.   I just got back from there and I can say that remained satisfied with your stay.

Put the hotel in the white list, because it is very clean, has a great view of the city and the breakfast was varied and constantly brought sv″ršvaŝite things.  However, I want to warn that is not mentioned anywhere, but in the room only the use of the pool. It is small, but nice. Steam bath, Jacuzzi and sauna are paid separately. Very bad impression made us especially the payment of the sauna, as it is on a different floor of the pool and get paid for 1 hour stay per person $ 15. As you might guess it is not normal to sit in a sauna for 1 hour. It has almost no parking and Park on the street-is also not good for 4 * hotel.</comment><comment category="positive" id="30280886">Hi! And we had a weekend in velingrad-family hotel "Jeri", and to give feedback. I chose it because of the positive comments earlier in the topics (for which I thank the customer) and I can say that we are generally quite satisfied with my stay there. For the price we paid ($ 110 for 2 nights in a double room Deluxe with breakfast) conditions were wonderful. The room was very decent, with a bedroom with a very comfortable mattress, sofa, small table, air conditioning, bathtub, hair dryer, bathrobes and terrace, from which you could see parts of the mountains (otherwise the prices in the restaurant were very good (we haven't eaten there, but e.g. espresso coffee is $ 0.80).   The only thing we don't like is the first paddling pool is really super little (that we knew it in advance), but the water in it was not particularly clean, and there is no ventilation, relying solely on the doors that open when entering and leaving the guests (the doors and cantankerous and must be pressed several times, until you get close). But again, for the price the hotel is worth a visit, unless you hold a very big and nice looking pool.  In velingrad recommend to eat lunch/dinner Manolevata Tavern (in the Centre, to the family-run hotel Maggie)-super kitchen, lovely folk atmosphere and music, very good service. Like us and a small diner Bonjour, which looks more like a pizza, but we ate a lot of Nice salads, mushrooms with butter, pork ribs and dessert. We visited and famous Rhodopean village that I read a lot of negatives, but we lucky that we were there for lunch and there wasn't a lot of people, and we serve a very crisp and attentive waiter. Otherwise, the establishment did not like-it looks like a barn and I imagine waiting falls when it is filled.

In the first moment, when we were wondering whether we're at IKEA, quads, or art gallery. I don't know, there was something very appealing in this hotel, but at that time, and something that really annoyed. The hotel is old school, which has thrown an awful lot of money for furniture, décor, paintings. The radiators are in the vapour form of guitar, butterfly, fish, clover. They had strange ideas like plastic Cabinet drawers or a folding canvas wardrobe. The bad thing was that there was no heating. They put us on a stove in the room with them is greem. We had dinner in the restaurant and then the waitress and the Cook, who otherwise were very polite, gave us the key to the hotel and they said the next day at 8 will come something like that never happened to me. M″rmorehme that the steam is weak and our floor is missing, but once we were alone and his staff left the four began to go around all the rooms on the floors of the hotel (absolutely everything was unlocked. If we were some idiots we'd probably leave with half the hotel.) here, fun). The next morning when the staff appear to work asking him to light the heater because I still pay and is not comfortable sitting in the lobby of the hotel in the cold. And in the rooms, which were 2 of 2 and electric oven warmer them pretty quickly, 2 people is difficult to pass, and what remains of the company 4 people and 2 dogs to svrem warm inside. Politely responded to our request, but we were told that at 8 before you go will stop the heat (we were alone in the entire hotel. With no support staff, even if there was no one at the reception), because it was ordered, when there's no one on the staff not to leave the heater running. And we stayed again on the stove. But what about at night? Power cut, respectively, stopped and stoves. Stopped the water, because pumps are electric, the pale začenki of heat out. At night we turned up with three layers of blankets. In the morning, we told the staff that we want to talk with the kind owner of the hotel and to say that for such a service we want some kind of compensation. One of the staff said that the owner is now in Bali and is very expensive to call on the phone, (quote) will write over the Internet. Dig a few minutes on the phone and said, ' well, she is very angry and said that not acting honestly. She has been in many more luxury hotels and there the power is stopped and it was cold and you have no right to complain. These are cases of force majeure, and you have to pay!  I wonder what this is force majeure. The fact that the hotel winter time is empty and is not internally, owner ranks not to start heating? There are thousands of baby izg″zici for Interior, but not $ 1000 generator? Force majeure is support staff to leave at 8 pm and there's no one is at the front desk?

The hotel is nice, we've been in the Studio and in the apartment, with kitchenette are all wide, clean, very comfortable. There are two restaurants, but we haven't tried them, our child doesn't like to stay in institutions. There is a children's playground next to the reception. The hotel has a heated parking, very comfortable for the luggage a lift. When there is a lot of snow is difficult because the hotel uploading final stretch is very steep, but the boy from the parking lot up and moving cars. Recommend hotel the best location of the pit lane. Last winter we went often in the Castle, past the hotel, runs track, but the stairs are very annoying.

We had a reservation, we had to a Royal occasion and we wanted to pamper in Spa, but when we arrived there was no electricity. At Olympus we were a couple of times, I like it and I wrote before. I bought vouchers from the VIP offer for weekdays out of about 87 Euro per night, per Studio. After a major overhaul is the hotel, the rooms are with new carpets and wallpaper, very clean and warm. There is a lunch menu, the food is delicious soups $ 2.50-Basic-4-5 euro. There are evening, shopska salad Orchestra ate-5.80 BGN, steak my husband around the neck was a big child, 8lv bites with cornflakes around 6leva. We're happy with. We are now without a voucher we pay 100 euro for three back in the Studio, we have said that we have a personal occasion and gave us the Studio with bath, do not use it, but very good. Honor makes people behave in distress that the client does not feel discomfort. Only the sauna is not working, the catcher said he was stopped because of a power failure.  If you want to ask something, I'm available. The Aura I haven't been and I can't say I've read here that there is a nice swimming pools, but the base is old. Food may also wasn't much more memory.

Which beach you ask? In general or one that falls just below the Aurora Beach Hotel In? which account is based on the MINISTRY of the INTERIOR (at least it stays closest). Are there nice beaches, the free zone is very small and unguarded beach. On the parking-it is a small resort, and is so overpopulated by car this summer (not only in the hotels, and many locals go to the beach during the day) so I have no where to ride into the complex by car, he calmly walks around on foot or by tourist train in or in front of the hotel there is no how do you secure on-site parking. Basically, the hotel is located in a quiet part of the resort still, with entry through the checkpoint and immediately to the right. I don't know if I answered what they care about, but if there's something else ask (and Yes I know, but specifically about the hotel I can not give a personal opinion)</comment><comment category="negative" id="30334930">Thanks Pupi85, it's a shame that it happened with the piano. We were there for five days around March we took third and excellent. That's our next vacation there, only good things I can say. There are also small. imperfections are not made a good impression on me, but on the background of everything else, don't even bother me. We had breakfast with dinner package. I have remarks on the replacement chef, respectively the convenience things he got every time, but there's no choice, how to stay hungry. The quality of the products is a bit more cheaply, I hope this trend does not continue. In the room stood on the stopped heating, because we were too hot, this is not a minus, just prefer a lower rate. Spa-a warm, clean, complete, without being prenaselono because of the many facilities, compliments of the employees. Definitely I think Royal is the best choice if you go with a child up to 7 years for example. Everywhere in the hotel is very warm, in the corridors, Ziad are cold as for the Spa.  NGWA is a very nice hotel and we went there many times. I don't like this new cold topilo, which replace the hot mineral pool in the porch of the sauna. The pool is nice, not always warm enough to be suitable for a small child. The Jacuzzi is sometimes not cleaned, respectively, do not enter. The outdoor pool is ... Paradise and winter swim in it, minus. as degrees. One of the rooms are worn out, for this price class and claims that there is a hotel,/if you read/highly-Renovate!

Militana, I don't know what to advise you speak with the Agency to change the date, if your children don't risk. I think that even to open hotels on Saturday will have hell of a cold because of the closure. If I can be useful, feel free to ask. Otherwise the path is scrubbed, today over Hotel râzaha pines, there was a danger of fall. The Manager said that procure diesel from Plovdiv, probably is not cheap, but at least they work.

I really need a miracle to fix things up Saturdays. On Friday may will decide how to approach it, in all cases, however, will call on the phone at the hotel, the Agency is closed on Saturday and don't rely on it.

Guest reviews of hotels with reservations from all over the country and abroad traveled to the so-called spa capital of the Balkans on Sunday to be greeted by noon from the few remaining at the front desks with the news that the town doesn't have a current of 34 hours. The hotels are cold water, to get to them is an adventure, because even the central city streets have not seen a snow plow, relationship with the rest of the world have only one of the subscribers of mobile operators. However, adventure and leave. Gas stations also do not work.  Nature, there is no dispute, is stronger than us. That hoteliers, who were expecting good osmomartenski however, gains followed a bother to warn their customers about the situation I also believe is undisputed.

As for you, accept that there are people who don't visit luxury hotels, do not go to expensive places, but also want to see something and love someone like them. I have a feeling that by giving an opinion or someone asked something more clutter to your taste you can see negligible and insulting. Not taking a report when and how many times you write somewhere, but really stand out. It's nice to read about some hotels that you might not visit, because at least I understand where-what is it, and does it ever maybe. I've never been disparaging to anyone, not to mention insulting. The other theme may be common, but not really is somewhere back there, and I read it and rarely writes and no information as to other resorts, which is weird. I'm thankful for the theme not rated at all and here something that window has an interest in the subject to nudge her. The fact that someone has invited others to express opinion doesn't seem wrong, and he wants the topic to be ahead of other people might be interested in Pamporovo-why not. And it's irritating you do not need to be written and the izobŝ. Is there some threshold of parenting in my opinion that we must follow. Otherwise, believe me, my tongue could rival much more spice, but we're here to help if we can with advice, opinions, directions. So I understand it.

Birth mothers are walking 20 miles to get to the maternity ward, I think is unwarranted accusation right for hoteliers. Soon I offer from one company for the aggregate for luggage from 200 sq.m, price 20000 EUR I don't know if it counts the number of square feet, but imagine what kind of investment is to provide electricity for days when there is an event of force majeure.

Because it turns out that one of my most favorite Maxi, Aquatonic, Royal-closed.     Can you point me to the exact legal act and the exact text which says that 4 and 5 star hotels have a duty in cases of force majeure (distress is such) to support electro-generators? I personally took the trouble to read this Ordinance//uacg.bg/filebank/att_1800.pdf and nowhere I saw this requirement. If I'm wrong, please prove me wrong. Only for FAMILY hotels with three stars have such a requirement. In this case we are not talking about those. Our business unit that supports 10 computer (far from everyone in the Office) in the current stopped cost 20 000 euros.   In addition, the hotels often do not have the coordinates of all its customers. It's happened to me and I can say it for sure.  All it is clear that there is a declared state of emergency in the area. First of all it is your responsibility to inform about the conditions and decide if worth risking.    Without anyone to protect the hotel (because I think that in most cases do not correspond to the LEVEL of that claim), I believe that the legal framework was a curve. If we start to check each hotel, you will probably find that completely meets the requirements of the law.  </comment><comment category="positive" id="30341876">Provoking me the topic Unusual summer holidays in Bulgaria and want to share the hotels you impress with your nestandartnostta the different broadcast, artistic, unusual, weird, but wonderful) number one in the rankings-http//www.artdolen.com/index.php http//www.arkantours.com/bg/page/hotel_arkanhan you are   </comment><comment category="positive" id="30342035">Will keep an eye on the subject with interest, looking for places that are not visited until now and there are good reviews about them.    </comment><comment category="negative" id="30342060">Let those hoteliers, who invented and put signs in front of Velingrad village a few years ago to get a phony mugging, now they're being advertised to the WORLD SPA CAPITAL    </comment><comment category="negative" id="30342142">  Let those hoteliers, who invented and put signs in front of Velingrad village a few years ago to get a phony mugging, now they're being advertised to the WORLD your last SPA CAPITAL inclusions are pretty ridiculous and rude.

All reservoir dogs you run on the lawn, and their owners never. We were seated in the restaurant of the hotel to have dinner, take a look and if you like us to stay for a longer time. We were unable to eat even though-two huge dogs ran out on the table next to us and were hunkered down in the face plates. My children, who generally are not afraid of dogs, the horror came from and were crying. At one time appeared one farmer and took his dog, however the way stay-no waiter kicked him out, nor did any of the guests, and I never knew whose it was. Very quickly we moved out of there and we have no intention to get more.  Otherwise, if we talk about design-this hotel in Varna is worth all received awards http://www.graffithotel.com/.

To say to those who are younger, that up to and including 15 years ago in almost all offices were forbidden to bring on vacation child up to 3 years for the following reasons People go there mainly to be treated and they need peace and quiet; Even their mothers, grandmothers and tatkovi, etc. taking place on 3 or 5 treatments, during which there is no way to keep the child with them; If there is a mineral water was in the showers, faucets in bathrooms and/or in the pools it also should not be used indiscriminately for hours and, in most cases is highly mineralized and very often including the presence of radon, which is a heavy metal. And the kids won't stop a 15 minute and tell them you have to go out of the pool. And Yes, young people are also not for those places-their first was bored and secondly there is not about jumping in water and spraying.  3. Hotels with golf courses are not for young children, because I don't want to tread on the turf, the players focus on the game and every noise in their way. Of course, that there is another type of recreation areas, where the target group is a family-run hotels or entertainment venues, and sports grounds:-the first primarily provided for activities for children (children's play area, children's swimming pool, animation, children's game room, etc.) food-children's menu or choices in the system and so the kid to eat healthy; -in the second bar, disco (even for Resorts targets young people for kuponâsvâne) Tennis Court, soccer field, or any other type of courses. This separation of the travel service is for many years, it is widespread in many countries and I haven't heard, read to be considered discriminatory.   </comment><comment category="positive" id="30367170">    Dzver peace to you:</comment><comment category="positive" id="30367208">      Dzver at you peace peace hug:</comment><comment category="negative" id="30367265">fatalina then what is this thread, once things are settled.

I go to a summer pool relaxation with this purpose-no one jumps from three feet, screaming and I could take two hours of silence to swim without lapping waves of enthusiasm around me.

The fairy as if it is more suitable for a family with a small child, there are indoor and outdoor heated pool, the food isn't bad. It's a bit expensive compared to other spas, but is calm, pleasant, we went to when the child was three years old and we were satisfied. The food was on the menu, breakfast and dinner, and I think that only drinks are paid. In Venikata is noisy, the weekend there are many people and the pool is crowded. You need to have in addition to breakfast and some other meals included-breakfast or dinner in the hotel restaurant, because it is impossible. A must go to the Inn by the river Junkies, that is very nice, by the River, but to go by car. Overall we were satisfied with the troyan Balkan, but avoid it lately, there's not a lot of places to walk, we went to a cabin, now I do not remember her name and the prices are quite high. 3 nights go around 450 euro, that and more, and in other places we published about 300 leva. </comment><comment category="negative" id="30381973">I have not opened the link in post # 1, I found that interesting in advertising on a blog, and I don't like to read people's thoughts in this form.

There was a spa, pool and any other extras-fitness-beauty, things like that. They were a novelty. The idea was that women should be able to ŝ″pukat through the hotel negligee, not to be wary of men. With two more friends are navihme to go for a week, but then my husband took that slammed with pneumonia and work sucks. And we couldn't take advantage of a one-week life, free from the male, I don't know what happened-whether the idea has been profitable and has until today there was a hotel or just experience the difference and not existed. But now, 20 years later, I like this idea.

The road was great, no problems with power or etc. wasn't there. All pubs operate!  Want to share his impressions of the vaunted Hotel Royal Spa. Spa really is super, there is no equal in the entire city. What you see on the site, this is really. Very good level even for the West Spa Hotel. However, for the hotel and catering in it I can't say the same. On arrival it turned out that the closest parking place is 200 m from the entrance and there is no one to help you with your luggage. Then the receptionist with a friendly smile, said that because there were no available luxury rooms will make us upgrade from standard double room we're going to move into a luxury without surcharge! We agreed of course and we headed to our room with luggage in hand, no one offered us to take to the room, as they do in other hotels. The room we had over 160 metres walking obstacle course of stairs first up and then down. (we were on the first floor), three Hall of over 50 m. each, until we get there. The last corridor was considerably colder. All this distance had to be izminavano each time to go anywhere from the room (restaurant, Spa, outlet, front desk) in a bathrobe or not! The room itself turned out to be a small box, with a very noisy air conditioning which if you stop instantly becomes a super Stud. The bathroom nice, but very cold. And top of the cake was the view from the window! At the site of the hotel says bad words-2gunfire 2gunfire:. We forget that this hotel personally. It can be used only the Spa separately against 35lv., which is OK but there not! Velina, Grand, Maxi, Sveti spas, Aquatonic and somewhat Olympus-these are the best hotels in velingrad! I at the Royal Spa didn't feel comfortable! There might be nicer rooms that are larger or more similar to the reception, but the first impression stays!</comment><comment category="negative" id="30384832">I want to ask something.

By the way, I'm very uncomfortable to go on a spa weekend and some kids to the ripkat chapter in the Jacuzzi or in the pool. I believe that all hotels should put children's hours in the day-for example, in the morning from 8 to 10 am and in the afternoon, say, from 13 to 15, and then the children is prohibited in the zones and visit Spa pools. It provided that there are no children's pools in the hotel, of course. In the end, a person goes to a spa to relax, not to scream and ripat head miscellaneous children. And their parents are supposed to do-there are grannies, nannies to help, while mom and dad are on a spa weekend.</comment><comment category="positive" id="30389852">    http://www.copsa.bg/CHATEAUCOPSA.aspx is not a luxury spa hotel, but it seems to me interesting, does anyone have any reviews?

Summer summer, the quote is actually a joke. It does not reflect the attitude of/think of Gerri was, forgive me if I'm wrong/author of this quote to children in General. I also don't have a bad attitude towards children, but I have no such positive in principle. It's all according to the child-dependent.  And because of the holiday, no one can guarantee a good education of children, and, forgive me, my personal opinion is, lately has been rather poor or missing, it really find the idea on the subject of positive.  ............ The fashion in the past decades, excessive liberalism in the cultivation/as far as manners is available and is not considered a dirty word that far/and I'm extremely unsympathetic.

It's good to have those hotels without children, if there is such demand. Maybe if the topic was in Hiking, they would speak and the hoteliers.

If you are going on a honeymoon, for example, or a trip with friends, will be very important. Some hotels do not write on your site, they do not want children, but does not offer special price for them, for example, or write to fit children's entertainment. If you replace this word, probably will sound less scary, but it's what I'm talking about.

There's a children's hours in the day (say from 10-12 am and the morning of 13-15 p.m.) and then the pools, Jacuzzis, etc. recreational areas in hotels, are banned for children.

The room is not enough lift, and from the top floor is through a door that leads to a staircase and up to the room. Extremely uncomfortable.

Luxury or rather a class hotel is a combination of factors, which at least I have not seen to exist in its full volume in any one place for accommodation in Bulgaria, with the label kičeŝo 5 stars. I claim that I've stayed in a number of really good hotels in the world, but in the best case conditions only come close to international standards. Someone above mentioned the reindeer as a good example. This good in their original design resort, today is blatant proof of what she's capable of human greed, stupidity and parvenûŝina. And since the question of the subject's who are still best hotels in Bulgaria (not to say luxury), here's what I can recommend as positive examples from personal experience: For city hotels-Modus and graffiti in Varna, Sens and Grand Hotel Sofia in Sofia. Spa-Hotels-Maxi and Velina-velingrad. Mountain hotels-Villa Harp-Pamporovo. Bulgaria Sea Resorts, hotels, holiday centres, most of the former Communist Party of the PA-Euxinograd Residence, Riviera-hotels Imperial and OASIS, sunny day-Hotel Palace.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30394553">To.

No, I'm not complaining from the children's show. I was about to listen to prežalila čaveto Disney ligoč. But the bad thing is that the little child that wasn't there and I get bored, endlessly, spoiled the older kids (including mine). Child is not guilty, of course, and I guess his mother.

Or in the hot tub? There are clear signs, written in red-no jumping! (it doesn't say forbidden jumping, which I interpreted that for all jumping is prohibited).  And if the parents are normal, the children understood very well what can and what can't.  If the parents are great, very clear and that the kids are like that. And the parents of bullied children no less leisure. This is supposed to be the distinction.  And not just sharpening our teeth and turn on fuckin' necks myself, 'cause lapetata is easier.    Well, that's exactly what I mean, I guess and other supporting my thesis, how don't you understand?. There's no way to make a selection on the door of the hotel which parents are normal and which are not. Read one post up from the summer summer. ;-) So, along the dry, and wet forests. And I can not figure out why what ten pacifiers, to the poor victims of their parents ' target topic. The theme is designed for parents, not children. Children are a product of their parents, at least while they are small. I guess that goes without saying, here we talk about children up to the age of 14.

The first version of your proposal is fairer, but come on, tell me honestly, how many people, either with or without children will come to rest in this type of hotels? people Usually on vacation do not like to be restricted in time. I remember in my childhood there were feeding in the first shift and the second shift.  The second option is downright discriminatory to children at certain times-adults in all and will follow the sanctions of the KZP, still not profitable.  I'm for clear and precise rules to be followed by children and adults. Because the swimming pool for example, is not a place for jumping, but it's not a place for kissing, right? The steam bath is not a place for favors?

In the island and before we were, and we're very pleased both times we were in the House-if you are with young children note to grab a leaf blower, the rooms are warm, but in the daily cold last June and had 3 days in Helena, the weather was not quite with us and we left early. In Usoeto we were with us and my parents only had two families. The garden is nice, the swimming pool was not released, but it is very small. The rooms themselves are really like in the old days, everything is loud-bed, floor, doors, we were 4 families and passing someone down the Hall like it was in the room. I don't even want to think about how it is when the entire complex is complete. Personala″t is a slight slope, the food was delicious and the normal prices.

In terms of food have made progress, for which I dare say we have input. I have to admit that we have not had stomach problems. The breakfast menu is modest.

Included in the voucher, for example, 2 days for two with breakfast and dinner-$ 100, which is good I think. There are many restaurants nearby, if you want to dine out. It's nice and clean staff friendly. Hotel rich is also close, and the Park around it. Mostly the Center and main street or pedestrian area. well it's good location. Stops and trip to the Kleptuza Lake in front of the hotel close. I recommend for people who can't afford the luxury hotels. I found a quote that is valid at the time of hotel Rome.

Now I decided to write because it is v″zmutih of the conditions at aura. We went a few years ago, and since repaired it. We're staying elsewhere, but because of the friends we went to the pool. We were horrified by the conditions-write what we saw: enter the general premise of the locker room and start hard to breath, gasp for breath, and you start to sweat, terrible humidity and no ventilation, you walk into the locker room for women (i.e. the same baggage but only is enclosed a small part of it) and you see mold, mildew and mold again-anywhere, it smells terrible, from the ceiling drips water on you and your clothes because there is no ventilation, and there we enter the pool the same water everywhere-literally džapaš, canals are clogged, again no ventilation and in 15 minutes you start going bad, hang out a little outside-the outside swimming pool is really warm and even in this cold was good, but with the little kid I was afraid to sit long in there and finally we decided to go I'm looking for a shower to rinse my kids-only pools and inside the locker room, the total one try on it-it turns out that not working tap for cold water, and by the warm boiling flowed, just not the big kid oŝavih sent to the pool a little flushed, then barely got dressed them in the locker room one on one and half-naked we went out in the hallway on the first floor to drought We were wet-kapeŝiâ purposes of the ceiling of the moisture of the effort is not into the other while get dressed! I think if you can't offer good conditions (especially for foreign visitors) may not offer them at all, their price is as of the Council of Ministers or the Rich and tragic conditions, just no words. Before we go down to the front desk and told them the indignation, and they replied that we saw first what is and what is not liked, I asked how to see in advance that not working cold water tap, for example, I told them about muhala and the moisture and it said that there was no way the temperature of the water that of course is not because all (or almost all) Hotels in velingrad is also hot water so, if not warm, but they must have good ventilation, here they have a problem and don't seem to care that losing customers.

To take a child to a hotel in which there are no restrictions and let him go in the children's pool? But for the spa are made. There's no place for children and it is right to have restrictions. But not everywhere.  In addition, in some other countries there are hotels that do not adopt children.  I dare say that I have a wide experience with Spa Hotels (mostly with mineral waters and some without) in Bulgaria. The situation almost everywhere. If you want a real vacation-only during the week and outside national holidays and vacations. Although there are exceptions to this. Lately Royal Spa and during the week is full (vouchers) and avoid it. </comment><comment category="negative" id="30558440">    I guess you have no children yet or are just bigger, and therefore say that We who have children, what to do?

And where were the kids at the time that you were a spa holiday? -rhetorical question doesn't answer.  I feel what we want children to stand still, imitating the adults. No one says you have to let them do whatever they want, but now is the time to have fun, to run, to laugh, to play.  Enough already with one time, one time it have changed things dramatically, and not all have on hand the grandparents, to watch their kids, when they decide to diversify from the boring everyday life. Or is it time to make and hotels-a shelter for children, someone else to babysit while mom and dad relax in SPA hotels and do not interfere with adults.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30558485">Why water is not min is very useful for kids?

Of course, you always select the hotels under the above criteria. Not all hotels are equally suitable for children, a fact.

Hi again with reviews of hotel elegance-Ognyanovo.  Super, Super, Super, very nice, warm pools, the food very tasty and huge portions, the rooms warm and clean, I commend him, we're very pleased with the hotel.    There are two outdoor swimming pools, a children's and large, in the children's pool water is very hot, it leeeeko, but pleasant, in the big pool is also hot, very nice tempperatura. The pools are both open and covered, there are openings in the roof, and it's not stuffy, and the air is fresh, and at the same time, as the spirit out, only the Sun is felt because it is covered with very thick nylon (I do not know how exactly is the name of this coverage, but you know what I'm talking about). There is also a sauna and indoor pool, but we didn't go there, and he is quite small. But I don't need an internal, external, because as I have said, are covered and can be visited at any time.   Cleaned every day, towels changed on our second day, bathrobes, Spa said it has against 5 EUR extra charge, but we're through the marketplace.   We had breakfast and dinner, very tasty, the portions are huge, I've never seen so big portions, with one naâždahme I and two kids and stayed even. The breakfast and dinner was on the menu, breakfast was optional miscellaneous hot sandwiches, with cheese, cheese, egg and ham and sundry combinations and had French toast. Also had dinner menu for a choice of about 20 dishes. Prices in the restaurant are perfectly normal, e.g. shopska salad, a huge re-4.50 EUR, 1 ball ice cream-50 CT, $ 1 coffee, cappuccino, 1.50 and all I remember with precision, but overall very acceptable prices, and cheap for the portions directly.   In the hotel there is a little patio with swings and sand pit, very nice, staff is very polite, without being an added bonus.    I was beautiful, in the period in which we were, there were only two families, so we were pretty much alone in the pool and the restaurant.   Who's wondering, wondering, that's very nice hotel, I won't regret it, especially with vouchers is very advantageous.   If there are any other questions, I have a date!</comment><comment category="negative" id="30564281">In this topic I started to write a retelling of thumbnail persons who have never cared for children or those who long ago forgot about what it is.

Your children hindered the writing was an attempt to show you that things are not black and white and in fact have a place where older geeks among people without children (staying in hotels).  Don't try to spin and twist my mind. I said that once the hotels accept children, no one should refer to them as if they were animals and should be kept in a cage. And the other thing I said, and also claimed it back is that children have no place in the relax zone, but no one in the pools can restrict them to entertain (and there were such posts above). In addition, I wrote how we proceed when one of us wants to get into the spa and what do I do when there are children in this area, that prevent the break.   I wanted to take her child and get him to stop, but the education of adult there's nothing they can instill in me. Personally my kids annoy me at times a little bit of naughty mature, as described above. Recently I've been watching the trend of ancuzirane and lancizirane visitors in famous hotels.

The kids are over-stimulated, emotional, energetic, can't justify besneeneto without control, but I still remember that I was a child/a long time ago/and I'm probably izdraznila someone, sometime. The proper action in such moments is just the Manager of the hotel, restaurant, reception, go and say what I think is wrong. Most people just outside pufkat, but them comes to mind that I need to talk to or is very easy to be great and omniscient only in fairy tales. If one person complain loudly, it's not like they told him five previously, ten thinking it.

Frankly, I'm with mixed feelings. We were with breakfast and dinner included, we were eating lunch in the restaurant. Our opinion is that the food is not very good. There are things that happen and those who don't. Breakfast but dinner's accurately defined and if you don't like something included in bad. For example, the Greek Salad with chicken a gorgeous garnish grilled steak fries and crepe for dessert. The third night we were not at all satisfied. Cabbage salad with carrots, grilled mackerel and biscuit cake. What we ordered the free consumption of the child was better. At lunch there was much variety on the menu, and we don't particularly like and live music evening in the tavern, which is connected to the restaurant. Two so-called singers are nadvikvaha one another with a repertoire of several songs. We're not in this part and loud music I don't like us. The waiters aren't allowed very much elbow grease. The room decoration is nice, loaded with supplies, but two days in a row left the child without towels and had to call on the phone to bring us to the reception. In the room and in the restaurant's warm, but the corridors until you reach with the wet towel to your room was cold. Pool okay, it wasn't crowded, but the water in the children's section is the cold to my amazement. The outdoor swimming pool is not working at all. Hygiene inside struck me as not a very good level. There are exactly three lounge chairs and coffee tables with cross stools. Then I saw that the other lounges are lined up out the door. The good thing is that the pool is open until 21.00. At the Spa at give you a towel must be wondering who on Earth, after the Savior was kind enough to bring us some towels from somewhere on our question to the Lady at the front desk: who let the towels and tomorrow who still want towels? It was answered that she wasn't familiar, ask somebody else. Spa-I can't comment on it, but nothing special. Roman bath, Tepidarium, Sauna and infrared sauna, which collects just two people with elbow grease. In the vestibule there are 4 relaxation benches placed in the cold. My children went free. Children's corner, the kid has played there a little, there are also games with tokens that are constantly fed only cum and new the next day.

Very please and I for reviews of hotel Elbrus, two children are 3 and 8.    Depends on what claims you have. The hotel is decent, old guy with not much large rooms, renovarni (in Bulgarian), by no means luxurious. The pools are warm, spacious covered. As I understand it now has a permanent presence of the Saviour. There is a shallow part in the small pool. There are also areas for water massages. The large is only for swimming. Restaurant with reasonable prices. It has a fairly large park and playground, private parking and good location in the city. In my opinion, quality-price ratio is pretty good. Though the hotel is 3 stars. I recommend the apartments for 4-member family.  Before I forget-I do not recommend to go on the weekends, it's a Madhouse.  I hope to be useful.

A great base in bad hands. The hotel seems to be a family, because it works the whole genus there and I don't know if there are external staff, a waitress. Such dirt I've ever seen in any hotel, 3 *. We were a large group, so it's not just dirty in our room. Our room was 4 beds next to each other. Wardrobe doors and shelves, curtain crazy half of the cornice and hangs, two Office chairs. Two sheets were torn. The restaurant was full of pornography. Wait for coffee in half an hour and have to stand at the bar, I see someone else's client pull it. French fries-average 40 min per serving. Menus with different prices and items, and in the end it turns out that, for example, of the 4 types of vodka not one, and there are five that's not on the menu. Order red wine, not what we want, say 2 types to choose-pick his Merlot, they bring us Cabernet. And breakfast, I can't describe it, I'm sorry that I did not, but will quickly list-cheese and the cheese, but the lowest quality you can imagine, without any taste. Two kinds of sausage with the same quality, I was afraid to eat from them. Butter and jam from these hotel, diluted milk, French toast, but with missing eggs. And diluted stepče. This is!!! At least one pickle or tomato you had. The worst thing I've seen in any hotel. And I went in very miserable, and at 5, so I have a comparison, and I'm not pretentious at all.</comment><comment category="negative" id="30743975">Do you know when is the weakest season for Velingrad?</comment><comment category="negative" id="30746401">  Do you know when is the weakest season for Velingrad?

We chose the first because we were in this place. By booking at least they sent me 5 e-mails and called me a few times to ask if we were OK and everything's fine. After the first conversation with the local Greek Office transferred to Bulgarian. Frankly, we were impressed.

Due to the fact that I was traveling for a story that had a couple of hours and had to prepare, we adopted this condition, but we asked two separate rooms, not one. We were utrepani by road at night and I was walking around town looking for someplace else to overnight.

Regarding the categorisation-I wouldn't risk with 3 star hotel, it's my opinion!       People never hoete in buyuk anadolu didim resort, this is the most smotanâ hotel I've stayed in Turkey. Full parody full!!! Everything sucks. Don't go there.    Support with both hands. Yesterday we returned from there. It actually meets the 3 stars + large pool. The rooms are good, the pool also with this end pros. They clean the rooms every day, but not washed it once.  Meet the food 3 stars-salatniât bar becomes, the rest is from the cheapest kind of breakfast-sausage, 1 type of cheese and cheese; almost no meat, not to mention in what quantities you put one night had a grilled chicken, cook 1 cut thigh in half for two people, we left and he cut off another leg of 2 and just not us. Sweet things with starch, including and most cakes.  At the pool bar cocktails for the Turks, Bulgarians want 10 pounds. There is no bar on the beach. Ringing all day, cool, Bulgarian Chalga. Animators are very weak. The attitude is also not good. Last night we were mušnali under the doors note that if not free until 11 pm we're going to get a ticket (in the rules, in our contract with the Agency, in the accommodation voucher, you said 12 h). Some people bought them. Too bad performance. On Saturday as a new shift came in the lobby bar open 1 hour later-someone to spill free coffee instead of taking 4 pounds.  Overall the hotel sucks.   I'm not quite agree, as were stranded there in May and things were far more rosy than that which is commented out in the last post. we had no bath and I can't comment, but rooms everyday čisteha, towels are changed non-stop, as well as those for the beach I changed them in two, three times a day, given that we had a child a year and a half. We let her room late and there was no problem. for the animation I mean, who knows what the child went to bed early and we watched movies on a laptop with a drink in hand. for the food, not to answer the 5 stars, as well as the hotel's 4, but considering that this is a hotel of the Turkish labor unions, miners and it was happy.  kucaha fruit, but also for the money that offers hotel is bearable. Yes everyone is entitled to an opinion and claim as paid, but it's good to compare things and from other countries, not just digital.

Which beach you ask? In general or one that falls just below the Aurora Beach Hotel In? which account is based on the MINISTRY of the INTERIOR (at least it stays closest). Are there nice beaches, the free zone is very small and unguarded beach. On the parking-it is a small resort, and is so overpopulated by car this summer (not only in the hotels, and many locals go to the beach during the day) so I have no where to ride into the complex by car, he calmly walks around on foot or by tourist train in or in front of the hotel there is no how do you secure on-site parking. Basically, the hotel is located in a quiet part of the resort still, with entry through the checkpoint and immediately to the right. I don't know if I answered what they care about, but if there's something else ask (and Yes I know, but specifically about the hotel I can not give a personal opinion) Aurora is not Villa, Aurora's Hotel and next to it is attached the Villa Aurora, the hotel was startling, avoid it, terrible food, dirty and dingy restaurant with 20 tables, that's pretty rooms , inadequate staff, apparently the hotel sold extremely cheaply to foreign tourists, because it was full of rednecks grabeŝi inadequate, like sausages.

There is a big and nice lawn next to the hotel, 2010 there was only one slide, but steep, it was not for the child. We used to go to the sites of the Grand.  The beach is not close, but go in the shade. The rooms are small, we were in the west-facing and afternoon stood in there, more so because of the small room, the air conditioning was blowing all over the place and it was not appropriate to be released while the child is sleeping.  During the times of the meal in the restaurant was very scary – people, queues, food, lack of enclosed places. The food was fine, we had no problems, find out what to eat. For me the main problem turned out to be the terrace around the restaurant, which was fenced with ropes over a great distance, i.e. little calm could fall. That was a lot of stress all the time. There was a cartoon for kids, but mine was a little and is not included. There was also for parents in the pool and yoga gyms and the like. In conclusion I can say that the reason the price is low. We never went back there.</comment><comment category="positive" id="30915588">To share a review for Royal Spa for 2 nights with a voucher for 220 Leva-breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Yes, I support. And then the Aquatonic, especially if you're with children because of the swimming pools primarily.    For Maxi, I support with both hands.  On The Aquatonic. and with that, because of the pools, I don't agree at all. This is my personal opinion, but the Spa Aquatonic pool and generally easy to prenaselva. The Royal Spa is so large that there is room for all, children's pools are few, there is also a large outdoor kids plus adults.      At the Royal Spa I've been to, and the Aquatonic if avoid busy days worth and the food is very good.

The first time I was prepared for some kind of hell.  The truth is that the most intense heat that I've experienced abroad was in Rome, as it seems unnatural to someone I was in Morocco, and June, July and August, but what I've been through in Italy will not forget for the rest of your life like heat and severe weather. It was a bit lyrical digression by the sea, the ocean is not felt the heat, inside a lot warmer. As far as the dirty-African country the question is what do you expect. I don't know whether in winter or in summer is dirtier. Just perceptions of cleanliness are different. Morocco is not Germany or Switzerland, where admire the amazing structure and grazing cows, the infinite purity in the streets. Morocco's Arab country and Yes, it's dirty, the question is what kind of attitude going. There is nothing to see, experience, exciting and feels good and definitely a pleasant destination for a holiday.  As for the fact that Moroccans flee. The last time I went to the plane for Casablanca was full of French tourists going there on vacation.  For me the country is definitely worth the trip:)</comment><comment category="positive" id="30966674">  Hi, we are a family with 2 girls. twice last year were stranded in Aquatonik. that want diversity.

I was just looking for just such information about Morocco. My daughter/15/will left for Casablanca for 7 days, the children's folklore festival in late July. We still don't know a lot of details, but the fact that they're sleeping in the student dormitories in the African country worries me a little.

I was there around August and half of September. To tell you that there were days in Sofia was 36 degrees, 30. From there, I bought a soft sweater that I dressed in some of the days. Valya and rain several times.  It's dirty ... a relative thing. There are poor areas, there are also very clean and set places, literally the brightest. There are all so expensive, there are luxury, excessive luxury, there are even places where you don't want to tread, but are there. It's beautiful, it's different, go and see it.  The Italians are a little different attitude (Dutch, Spaniards, Frenchmen, as part of the French were of Moroccan origin) for the reason that in these countries there are many Moroccans emigrants. Or do the dirty work, or become doctors, smart, passionate people and tease them for being Gypsies, live in their countries. I'm not talking about all the Italians, all Dutchmen. But in these countries, there are such terms as to the emigrant. And we have our attitude to one ethnic group, although each will indicate and the exception.</comment><comment category="positive" id="30970803">Hi, after it became clear that green village is not our place, asking for offers that you check.

Otherwise, besejnčeto is good, very warm and shallow for small, there is a little patio, but quite a bit, the food is fairly good. The town is quiet and peaceful, nice River Park and playground. This is for three or four days, as we were. But more, it's not worth it. Teasing this cleaning, more precisely its absence, there is a woman who dumps trash and that's it! Soon we were at the Grand Hotel Bansko, wrote extensively on the topic of Bansko, meets our requirements, but again with the option to pool in the bathroom. Otherwise, good food, very clean, helpful staff, poor location-main road, and a good price-80 Euro per night in apartment for two v″zlastni and three young children when IT is super.

Maybe in the restaurant because we were a large group of waiters are not doing particularly successful at times. The swimming pool was not very warm, but it was OK.

I forgot to add me there the water was cold, even though it was summer.   For the rest, if you will--but there's and Agadir-very nice beaches there is a little further away 10-15 min drive from the city. What is decided with the Renta car. In Agadir villas can be rented as in Greece for 2-3 families with several rooms, a decent price kuhna a lot and is very nice for a holiday. This gives it only as an idea.    Some asked about the snakes. I personally am not seen, although a lot of laps and a lot of wild places, some just don't want to think now where I had newsm78 but with any savvy to ask me man.

Thank you very much! :)  Hi, Eleanor! I am currently on vacation at "aura. This is a pretty decent hotel and price-quality ratio is very good. Numerous and beautiful swimming pools-external internal-something for everyone, warm water and good hygiene, nice Spa area. The hotel is clean, friendly and unpretentious. Based on the hotel is old and there is no luxury, but it is well maintained, and although I have a lot of comments, I will come again, probably because of this price instead of 10 days I can get 5 in most of the hotels in the city. I personally do not like the food and service in the restaurant, but it's not the most important, and I'm not left hungry. But this is relative, because today I heard the views of other vacationers, who commented that the food was delicious. Everyone has their own criteria. If you're interested in something specific, just ask. Will gladly answer you.    Share how are double rooms with an extending armchair. Going 1 adult and 2 children of 7 d. and 11. respectively.

Aura's House is located in one of the streets in Rich, Elbrus is located on a hill, in the pedestrian area.

My impression, however, are not very recent.     </comment><comment category="negative" id="31030026">I hope you like it too, that everyone has their different views and criteria.

In both we were only the first in 2011, while the Grand-prior month. I like them both, the difference is 100 euro more for the first. So my question is-let, who was recently in Green wood to share on food quality, cleanliness and obslužvanveto. The first and second kucaha years ago, but now me the location and outdoor playground in the summer. Otherwise, the Grand Hotel Bansko my current vpičatlenie is very good with two strikes, you're-the location of the hotel-the central street and from there more noise, and extremely uncomfortable mattress, at least to me. There was a difference in the quality and amount of food on weekdays and weekends, but that's the problem. Otherwise, price/quality ratio with the listed two strikes, is very good. Just have second thoughts about the summer vacation in the mountains, considering that sče with three children up to 3 years???    I just mattresses are my favourites there, magnifleks-Orthopedic, great:) I don't know is there different types of mattresses in the rooms?  For a summer vacation in my opinion is better in the Green Wood, the Grand Hotel is also louder, and the pool is zaplaŝaše by guests of the hotel, as we were and no garden. otherwise, than anything else we've ever been happy.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31030594">  Hi!

I read that the water is recommended for injuries. Would you recommend a pool where to go?  I hope the weather is fine, that it's raining. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31030796"> Share how are double rooms with an extending armchair. Going 1 adult and 2 children of 7 d. and 11. respectively.   I guess for one adult and two children became a double room, but the Extensible arm chairs are not the most comfortable for sleeping, and in the double room is tight. But the truth is that the rooms are not spending a lot of time. Especially in this season.   Mmm in pools?   The pools are the great advantage of the aura and so is one of my preferred hotels. The Aura are more and well maintained. The water is clean and hot, like there is for every taste. Large deep pool with cooler water. Outdoor wading pool with warm water, for soaking, and for children, because it was about a meter deep. I liked the jacuzzi. Change their water every day. The indoor pool is also not bad. The spa area also very like, masseuses are good. Aura at all is a good choice and is a very good price-quality ratio. The kids will love it. It's close and to the Center.  Last year I was in the Elbrus and although not then worked the outside pool, and this year I wanted to go there again, but there were no seats so nights as I wanted. Both hotels have the same owner, but personally I think there is a significant difference between the two and that it is in a beautiful service. Elbrus There's a great hostess, that during our entire stay was taking care not to miss anything and having a good time. Such things are very valuable. There is also a very good restaurant. The food is wonderful and diverse and has very good service. The restaurant again in my opinion is a weak spot of the aura. Any organization can wait for an hour to serve and more so for the account. Nice people on the staff, but I suggest the organization.  In the Elbrus also has a very nice Spa area. Last year there were some promotions every day at the spa for treatments at half the price, I was very pleased. There is also a very nice bar, in which you drink kafenceto and cocktails, and the bartender was a smiling chap. I have many great memories from there, may have kept the level of customer service, because that's what is their great advantage. This year, however, offered only deals with compulsory dinner, at least when I I booked sometime in February or March. I personally prefer breakfast and pick yourself out of an extremely varied menu for lunch and dinner. I hope you have changed it. This year with a renovated outdoor pool and the outdoor restaurant things are probably even better. These are my impressions of the two hotels, in General in both would go again, but I'd prefer more of Elbrus. Both are suitable for families with children. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31031215">To give an updated review we are pleased Maxi. Even more than satisfied ... there wasn't a lot of people, the pools were clean and well-maintained. Breakfast was sufficient for all guests whether there are special glasses looked ... Well she had our room was clean and no remarks. To clarify that we were only for one night and we needed a change of sheets and towels. The restaurant, which we used for a great dinner, but I would say expensive. I recommend if you go for more days to consider a meal outside the hotel for lunch and dinner. Separately, there is a nice trail for walking, meadows and two playgrounds for the parked car Sun shades., which in this heat it turns out convenience. The other thing I liked was the late check-out until 14.00 on Sundays. We don't do the trick, because chasing us commitments, but another would be important. On the prank, I'm not decisive for a good time on a weekend. Didn't even impress me. If I didn't read past posts for hotel Maxi, I wouldn't even look at it, and in what was the designer of hassles. I would consider as a problem, but not for the hotel and holiday makers there, the near this building. Just below the outer pool it creates noise that definitely spoil the comfort of the guests. From me so I would go again with your child and company with children. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31031729">Someone was summer in Grand Hotel Bansko and reviews from the outdoor pool? </comment><comment category="positive" id="31033292">  Can you write everything as before, how that animation is something that troubles me Casablanca once again is the perfect hotel. the hotel is full but it's beautiful.

No, the village of Bath between Bansko and Rzlog, 3, 4 km. We're a favorite place, Roman bath and hotel Akvilon.

Last week we were there. may pozagubât me as a customer and a Roman bath, we walked a couple of times. They have discounts for June, with which the price is higher than last year's June. Poopraveno is the space/Park, oddly I sit some bands like from a crime scene to Gazi grass, built a new playground that I have comments on securing. The smallest pool was not complete. In the other two water was cooler than my memories of previous outings. In the middle of the rink/colder than most big/was with temperature suitable for swimming, but probably ... It was not announced in advance. Spa-Center is also under construction. Work a sauna and steam room with access from the reception. Breakfast is worse than last year, a kind of kaškavalopodoben product, a kind of salami and something of a ham, pieces of orange juice was a substitute for fruits and fruit juices. The food in the restaurant is really a matter of taste, but TSK. I'm not thrilled, when this is not the cheapest places in the village.

There is a dam, a hotel complex with restaurant, bungalows and a brand new pool. For 1 to 2 nights is okay, it's not over, there's nothing to do in the surrounding area, unless you're a keen fishermen. The restaurant serves fresh fish and is not expensive. The hotel rooms are small, but decent, with en suite bathrooms. The bungalows are more spacious and a more pleasant place a thick shadow under the cherries, but do not have their own bathroom, the owner is not there yet and their investments have yet to bathing dostroâva. There are shared bathroom facilities for all 5 bungalows. The pool is open to the outside, the price is 8 EUR for an adult, $ 4. for a child, large, clean, has a children's section with a slide. Saturday and Sunday are filled with people. Because of its proximity to Sofia is a very convenient place for a beach weekend night.   And a more luxurious proposal again in the region of Pernik near Sofia, which unlike the above, I have not yet visited, but they recommended strongly http://www.pridaba.com/. I was told that everything there is on the level, but the prices are above average. The pool has a separate children's section.

However, there was a huge cranes and construction of a new complex, probably to a Roman bath. We had no problem with the noise from the construction site, but workers are rested. Not be prepaid, you pay in the end, as there is a possibility even orders from the bar or the restaurant to be recorded on account of the room, not to be paid immediately in cash, a matter of choice. And a word of advice-don't worry, be set up for a nice vacation. My impressions are a bit negative, but do compare and with our previous outings. I was with loved ones who have not visited the hotel before it, they loved it. In August and is expected to be warmer weather, so more pools are hladkite advantage. Nutrition-a comment and kr″čmička On Laila-there also were getting ready for about a 10-day repair. As prices are much more reasonable than the Roman bath, the quality of the food was better.

There is a slide, swings, Monkey bars and climbing, which, however, are for children aged 5-6 years I think.

And from Sofia to Pamporovo how come? What are the roads and there is a possibility for public transport or car is the only option?

Mediterranean night of pool was amazing-there were all kinds of seafood, music program, dance etc service is very good. Rooms are very spacious. The pools are great. The Spa is excellent and varied. Massages, which I'm a fan are very good. True, it's a bit remote from the Centre, but there are some nice restaurants. I've been in Velina-baby food, and there is nothing bad, small rooms, pool, and Spa. just away from the truth. Last year we were at Geranium, which is right in the Center. And I'm very pleased. Deluxe room is a bedroom + small daily. The food was excellent. The outdoor pool is smaller than the Grand, but the hot tub was great. Inside there is a large swimming pool and another Jacuzzi. Well, it's not so luxurious as the Grand, but it's the Center, the restaurant has a large terrace, service is good, the spa and the prices too.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31122235">    To deposit $ 10. for a towel as you can every day to replace them with clean.

I know it's a bit outdated, based on Luke but for me the most-the ideal is to be on the first line and the pool on the beach. I love such.

The apartments are very nice, we were in one bedroom-living room with kitchenette, a hollow. terrace, bathroom with shower, bedroom, two LSD tv. In the entire hotel was very clean, towels changed every day. As you arrive ask to see the apartments in section a, I think there's a nice view of the mountains. The snacks were good, for there is much more to be desired are generally uniform and not very tasty, but I think you won't be hungry. Overall the hotel is very quiet and is ideal for relaxation. The internal pool was warm, the outside is cold. The courtyard of the hotel I loved it, there is a children's rides, gardens, benches, sun beds, Sun umbrellas, outside the restaurant there are booths with pillows, where you can also relax.

I am convinced, however, that does not exceed 27, as many cruise at hotels with pools and have an idea of how many are 30 degrees. First day complained of the low temperature at the reception.

The marine theme there are quite conflicting views about the beach in Obzor, that's why I'm asking specifically for this piece, which was given to hotel guests.    For me its quite normal sea gradually becomes deep within maybe 5-6 m navtre is about 170 cm depth. As long as you are strâskali with the deep sea, strong wind, coarse sand, etc. If compare this beach with, for example, Albena or South or Kitenskite or Primorsko Sunny. Beach is, of course, that there is a difference and in the sand and in the depth of the sea. You've been to Luke Hel. is this beach of Casablanca was left on it. Pass the free zone, which is in front of the Park and the stadium is in front of him and the beach of Casablanca. There's a big difference in both places. Since I have been to the beach and to the onion, I can say that there is a shallow sea. Look at that in the common theme speak with people who are not even set foot in the overview. I go and the Sl. Beach and beach there for me is the best along our Black Sea coast, but it's more crowded and that criteria Overview it excels.

The food was delicious, but made with low-quality products, the clichéd already plant cheeses and cheeses, very bad breakfast sausages and not-so-fresh meats. So far this year have dropped the afternoon snacks, which were not much, but for families with children, it is important to have them in the package. Disinterested-monitor, which, in addition to export toys out and then arranges them in, else you were doing. In addition, the apartments in the main wing are comparatively narrow-initially we were housed there in the bedroom, but it turned out that due to the presence of three pens is impossible to use the living room, and in the two bedrooms won't be placed. After one-hour talks in our apartment in the wing, which is closed during the summer-there are things quite razllični, but ....

We've been in Turkey several times and nothing compares to their all inclusive. There is a gym, Zumba 2 times a day, children's disco in the evening to allow parents to dine or to drink something from the bar at the pool, there is not enough sun loungers for all guests, but there are a few tables with umbrellas, which again can be used to settle and to swim. According to me this is more suitable for families with children. We like it, but we've had a good time almost everywhere, because we love to travel and go to different places. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31251915">I spent the weekend in Regnum. The hotel is nice as a base, furniture, apartments, clean, good service-it meets the category 4 stars, nothing is five-star. However, I am not satisfied with the breakfast buffet: poor choice, low quality products, sausages, Wieners, sausages-all the crap of the lowest quality, packaged cupcakes and croissants, the likeness of the two kinds of juice from machine with downright nasty taste, butter loaf in a bowl of water?!, no pancakes, as well as any pasta freshly cooked breakfasts. The food is very far from the claims of 5 stars of this hotel, even in three-star hotels I've gotten a better breakfast.  The location of the hotel in my opinion is not good, isolated stands, far from the Center, from shops and restaurants.  As the pros of Regnum can emphasise the swimming pools and aqua parks, clean and hot water in all, very good hygiene and organization anywhere.  </comment><comment category="positive" id="31252519"> Thanks Bled!

We have chosen it for the children's animation, which was in the offer. And so-Hotel 4 * is kept, but I don't think you're responsible for them.  Children's animation for that courtesy, I'd say is pretty poor. Morning animatorkite come to 10.00, going into the children's room (located inside the hotel) and, possibly, if the kids go there paint, build, etc. similar games until 12:00. The following activities with children are from 15.00 to 17.00 hrs, which are also inside the closed and from 20.00 to 21.00.  make children's disco, that first day was inside the hotel, and then didn't get her out in the yard. They're trying to make and animation for adults, but there is something to be found wanting. For the elderly offer morning stretching, then badminton and water gymnastics and evening quiz with questions after the children's disco.  Offer and "lessons" in swimming in the days leading up to Monday, Wednesday and Friday, resulting in that the Saviour gave to them on a Board and with her for about an hour to go round the pool and silently aimlessly.  Pool-Indoor, warm and clean. With an exit to the yard of the hotel, which is big and you can sunbathe on the sun loungers. Food-all inclusive, if you can call it that consisted of breakfast, lunch, ad. breakfast and dinner with fixed hours and not a minute later. The food, as the food monotonous and low quality products. Alcohol – only Bulgarian and only in designated meal hours. Water – only in the restaurant and you can pour only at times, other times the restaurant is locked and you can't get anything if you do not pay it. Soft drinks, juices of post mix (stepčeta), coffee and milk, too, only in the hours of the meal. This is the system all inclusive. Hotel rooms-hotel is located in the Centre of the city, it is bordered by the Town Park, which is an advantage over other hotels. Large rooms with balconies and views of the inner courtyard of the hotel and the City Park. Clean, towels are changed every day, sheets I think 3 days.  And not to sound like a foreign Lady, will say that the other years we were in Aspen ski &amp;amp; Spa and Murite and I have a basis for comparisons of service and quality in Bansko.

The rooms are OK, spacious, clean, loaded supplies, pen. The food ... Hmm ... This is their weakest link. Be aware that drinks just water from the dispenser and the dinner brandy karnobat and vodka, and coffee for breakfast (shocker!). Drinks may be purchased from the lobby bar, pool bar (for domestic swimming pools) and from the external bar of the Waterpark, the prices are bearable.

The hotel is nice. The location is great-close to the Centre. The apartment where we ensconced, is spacious, fully equipped kitchen, which in our case is not needed, we're all-inclusive. The main pool is big and the water is pleasant for swimming, and there are little kids with warm water. Water is not a mineral. To get to the pool and the restaurant, go through the garage, which is a little embarrassing, but nothing to die. The staff is responsive. It's clean, towels are changed every day.

The water is warm in all ponds and covering them during the night. The large pool has a bar, where food is available, and there's a spacious locker rooms with showers.

In the Regnum has a spa with indoor pool, also warm, everything is nice as a base material and a lot of good hygiene.

At the end of Bansko is that I don't like it, i.e. its location. Otherwise, as capacity is good, large rooms, the bathrooms, too. I remember that they had a nice garden.

Hotel 5 *, and the bathroom burned out bulb just above the tub. Shower in the dark. We asked for a bigger size bathrobes/front years gave us/, put the smallest. We went to have dinner at the restaurant and at the door an elderly waitress yells out that it was all booked. I was amazed how, at the reception or in the restaurant the day before someone bothered to let us know that we need a reservation. Then while we were eating like a punished in zadušnoto and noisy internal visit we found that all eligible are buffet. Obviously our desire to spend a free consumption 2 times more money is right. To have their business logic. I won't go into details about the quality of the food was shockingly, Scallops Saint Jacques of gum, the shrimp on stone, a piece of shit. And so from 20.30 to 22.30 on part of the reserved tables and not sit anyone. Barely have been reserved for later as their kitchen closes at 23:00. A complete mockery.

Only five minutes after we stopped another car. As soon as you open the trunk and the bellhop running bear bag. Guess the boy chooses who to serve. Great waiting while we sleep. Only at 15 and 30, we entered the apartment. We asked a few times what's taking so long, and the answer was the maid while she's ready with the room, and you'll be in a luxury apartment and it is larger and takes longer to clean up. We get out and another from the elevator on the terrace sitting maids, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes, and we have to wait. Rest periods must be respected, there is work in the apartment in the bathroom smells like cigarettes, and both children have asthma and I dismay not to irritate their cough, as with allergies and not to make a fit. In any case not be apartment 718 on the 7th floor. In the shower shall be collected so much water and all deep in it, drive the kids to tread carefully in order not to fall in the hours around 17-18 no hot water to coat quickly with cold water ... Morning at 7 and 40 min. the meeting of the maids on the terrace, which is right next to the room begins with coffee and cigarettes after lunch is the same at 2 and 50 min. I don't need a clock, hours of rest are strictly adhered to, it is said out loud and if you want to relax on the beach, forget it. no control for umbrellas and sun loungers.

Don't get me wrong, in principle I am not picky person and for dinner I can mine and of pretzels, but at this hotel, it appears that you can really stay hungry-raw rice, pomfret fish into pieces about the size of a thin Julienne (I don't see what else to eat besides other residues), noodles, which are done for five minutes, and the sauce sits alone and for dessert-solid green peaches.

I think the weakness of the hotels is the food at the ol' inkluziva. In principle the concept by offering all inclusive buffet implies lower quality food. Plus, that block the masses attract crowds of people like a magnet. Now looking for shopping sites collectively were flooded with offers for all inclusive in Bansko and cheap, suddenly all ran to offer all-inclusive very profitable, and they in fact have no experience at all inkluziva, this is indicative of me!  So I think I go back to get my hotel bed &amp;amp; Breakfast. The breakfast is poor, will compromise. As I wrote, in the Regnum is just such a case, but then there are the best pools and slides, so probably there will again book.

Are they really that bad?     Write with impressions of Vihren Palace last week. Overall, the city seemed deserted, very few hotels are showing signs of life. In the Vihren Palace there were mostly families with small children. Handy is the outdoor play area for children, because it is relatively wide, afternoon in the heat is shady, but inflatable jumping home for lunch and in the evenings they close at 8:00. Internal children's area is a room with toys for young children. Woman animator organizes games for older children in the evening for about an hour, that are fun, finally giving out awards.  There is a pool which is internal, but under a glass roof and doors are open to a small courtyard, where they lined up next to them, there is a Jacuzzi. I can't comment on the cleanliness of the pool because we haven't used. The food I think is sufficient and varied, with an average quality. There's always a watermelon, melon, Nectarine. Desserts are mostly profiteroles with cream, puff pastry with cream, and not with cream, cake, baklava. For those who prefer vegetarian meals, a choice-at least several types of salads and dishes.

On the ground in front of us an aunt made waffles, pancakes, American pancakes, eggs and Bacon omelets! The food was delicious, unique and perfect, I don't know how this is possible in such a short time, so things change newsm78 Spa-also like us, there is no smell of disinfectant, it was very clean everywhere. The pools were not dirty, just there the light was quite muted and Multicolore/one of the things that I personally did not like/in this connection, I prefer the pool of Vihren Palace, with lots of light and space. The water in the children's pool in the Grand changed every morning, we went pretty early and saw it with my own eyes. Even if one day I 2 times I went looking for someone at the front desk to alert you in the children's pool placed only cold water and he was the real-of all the cold pools. But after 2 of my remarks and demands, the man who started pouring hot water in the pool. For this claim and hygiene was on the level.  The only thing I didn't like was there, that we had no view of the mountains, and we looked to one wall and the other apartments, and our apartment was without terrace. </comment><comment category="negative" id="31294796">I guess for Easter and may holidays work, getting hit for summer in millet.

Read bad reviews because I think it turns out that Bansko's nat″kmen primarily for the winter season-this explains the lack of swimming pools and more fun for kids.    I think the weakness of the hotels is the food at the ol' inkluziva. In principle the concept by offering all inclusive buffet implies lower quality food. Plus, that block the masses attract crowds of people like a magnet. Now looking for shopping sites collectively were flooded with offers for all inclusive in Bansko and cheap, suddenly all ran to offer all-inclusive very profitable, and they in fact have no experience at all inkluziva, this is indicative of me!  So I think I go back to get my hotel bed &amp;amp; Breakfast. The breakfast is poor, will compromise. As I wrote, in the Regnum is just such a case, but then there are the best pools and slides, so probably there will again book. The pools are with extra heat, that I'm saying this, because I read about ice outdoor pools, for example in the Royal Towers and Belvedere holiday club.   In Bansko there are good restaurants and pubs, at least we ate delicious in several restaurants in our last visit.     And according to me should we hire Bansko bed and breakfast or breakfast and dinner, and not OL. Personally for me it is a place for walking, touring in the mountains, and so on, and not all day to stay in Hotel/another question is that we are already all around Bansko everything we've covered several times).

I don't know about the elevator, even insulted as I insisted if it works. So I didn't get robes. They said to run air conditioners and we're going to cool down. Something very worried.

I apologize, but I have one more question, if there are chairs on the terrace in the evening to sit down if you don't sleep. I saw may have dryers, but I see no chairs. How can there are no barriers between the rooms that we shared, there is no autonomy. I hope there's an elevator works. I'm disappointed to go before, and with such desires. I don't know if I can handle 10 days. I don't like to do that to be done, and we're not about 2-3 days to pass the time quickly and unnoticeably walks. So is there any chairs and so visible in the rooms of the neighbors. For I know that the swimming pools are nice, but now I am against external running, although I went.

Except this close and almost no separation of the terraces is bothering me, definitely not for noise, and just feel as if on display. When you get out you peek in the room next door. And you don't want to see it. At least the glass partitions were put. I'm not going to wear gowns that we have no car and a lot of space. If you give will use against deposit or whatever they want, if not health. I don't keep food as always find something to eat, nor of luxury in the room as long as it's nice and clean. But ... I can't go to bed quietly and let me Bake and plate and facing South in the summer. for 2-3 days there was no problem but ... I thought, no one is to blame. When I get back I'll write. Thanks for the information. Good summer everyone.</comment><comment category="positive" id="31305021">  Hi, we have a family holiday, I'm heading to Bansko. There are two quotes which hesitate-Vihren Palace and Grand Roâle. A child of 8 years, who loves to swim and the pool is an important part. I'd appreciate if you direct me. Tend to Vihren Palace, whether someone has been there and whether the pool was warm and clean.    With similar prices and look at it. As hotel facilities, furniture, pools is a hell of a lot better than these two. The pools are clean, the hotel is very clean, but only the internal is warm, at least it was when we visited him. There for the food I have comments. There were girls who were in the Vihren Palace and have written more forward in the topic, I think it was positive feedback and for him.</comment><comment category="positive" id="31305453">Girls, help!

We are a family with three children and were checked into a unique narrow room which was clean at first glance, but under the bed there were surprises, such as pills, buttons and other interesting things, which can choke one less child. Bathroom dirty, musty, mirror tiles, foam and neizmita are shit. The pools were very clean, with all the normal crowd. The steam bath or not working or call someone to let her go started working and doesn't stop, you have to open the door for a while or you're going to die inside. The sauna was warmed up well, but it smelled like urine, in the children's pool and the hot tub water was chlorinated terribly.

Giving primarily for children's camps during the year, but there is a part that is for guests of the hotel. There are horse riding training, nice big and clean pool, but indoor soccer field, a large, a very small Monkey bars and swings, but it is a remote and lonely place. There have their farm and produce and sell cheese, salami, cheeses, Chutneys, even the flour is theirs. I've been there this year so I write and it is therefore eco Hotel, you are responsible. There was no such features as in advertising for massages from the Russians, but it's something new. The furniture is not a luxury, it's not even that good, but it's nice and clean. I know that tomatoes, cucumbers and everything you cook is a private production it has there cows and some other things that are grown and available.

We are a child of 4 years, which loves the sea and generally there is no fear of the water. We arrived at Saturday, 1 p.m. in the afternoon, we had booked a Studio, which luckily was ready for habitation and fast. for inkluziva Bracelets all they put us to 15. Even before check-in at the front desk asked dryer for the terrace, but by the end of the stay that I didn't get, it's no big deal, just sharing my database it is poamortizirana, but I noticed the constant cleaning everywhere in our bathroom flowed from the shower stall and after bathing it is not pleasant to running over puddles, the problem with the hot water we haven't had any but we were on the third floor. We almost over the outside bar, which proved too noisy, especially on karaoke nights, but overall the problem there was no sleeping on the food I can say that I have no remarks, extremely varied and delicious in my criteria. The drawback is that in the high season for lunch and dinner, gets a shortage of seating and standing all the time of people around tables waiting to be released and somehow I felt all the time hasty to go faster with nutrition, which is far from worried part of guests and stood until late in the evening to eat ... what I didn't like, but everywhere is so that early morning pounce towels on lounges at the pool and on the beach, and so some people always provide places for bathing though not actually use them on a beach I can say that Gaza is huge, but the coast is steep and Rocky in the beginning is very deep and even my child, who is not afraid of water, refused to enter only your feet mokreše. As a matter of fact and I except to get wet for longer been bathing in the sea on the other.

So prehvaleniât Casablanca hotel is a three star hotel completely mediocre. Who gave the fourth star to go to blows. We're here for a second day and already I'm thinking about where to go next summer, because it certainly is not in Casablanca.  Base material is declined. Ugly interiors, broken locks on doors, cheap pož″ltâlo with linen, stains terribly uncomfortable sofa bed. The elevators are narrow and if you have the chance to be on the 7th floor, which we have, woe.   The food is terrible and the poor from the regular assortment. I have never seen such a miracle only years ago at, for which we paid $ 60 a day, not 220. Places in the restaurant is hard to find right now. Already I'm sick of meat and salads-another no. Tables-chipped, it's got a džasa.   The pool is filled with sand. So far, for information pool with sand I never met. The lounge chairs are broken and old.  The beach there is no how to change, but it is not perfect. The sea is right in front of the hotel. Absurdity is a child to enter unaccompanied in the rough sea, and yesterday and today. I had to go to the beach in front of Luca Helios, where the sea is nice and you're not out after only 3-4 metres away from the shore. Bay ganyo to my amazement is a great enthusiast and bother early to go to the beach and throw towels on the sunbeds. I'm sorry, the hotel is full of Bulgarians.   The animation is a joke. It is so tragic that it's not worth it to dwell on it.  If someone walks out of season versus $ 400, I can see why he likes it. As someone who has given a lot more, I can say that I will never set foot in this place so rundown. However, against the amount that I gave, I was expecting to get a lot more.

If the hotel is full I guess people are OK, the management are also OK. Personally I wouldn't do it again, not at this price and with this food.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31344623">  Many thought whether to write in the topic, given the inexplicable ekzaltiranost in this hotel.   So prehvaleniât Casablanca hotel is a three star hotel completely mediocre. Who gave the fourth star to go to blows. We're here for a second day and already I'm thinking about where to go next summer, because it certainly is not in Casablanca.  Base material is declined. Ugly interiors, broken locks on doors, cheap pož″ltâlo with linen, stains terribly uncomfortable sofa bed. The elevators are narrow and if you have the chance to be on the 7th floor, which we have, woe.   The food is terrible and the poor from the regular assortment. I have never seen such a miracle only years ago at, for which we paid $ 60 a day, not 220. Places in the restaurant is hard to find right now. Already I'm sick of meat and salads-another no. Tables-chipped, it's got a džasa.   The pool is filled with sand. So far, for information pool with sand I never met. The lounge chairs are broken and old.  The beach there is no how to change, but it is not perfect. The sea is right in front of the hotel. Absurdity is a child to enter unaccompanied in the rough sea, and yesterday and today. I had to go to the beach in front of Luca Helios, where the sea is nice and you're not out after only 3-4 metres away from the shore. Bay ganyo to my amazement is a great enthusiast and bother early to go to the beach and throw towels on the sunbeds. I'm sorry, the hotel is full of Bulgarians.   The animation is a joke. It is so tragic that it's not worth it to dwell on it.  If someone walks out of season versus $ 400, I can see why he likes it. As someone who has given a lot more, I can say that I will never set foot in this place so rundown. However, against the amount that I gave, I was expecting to get a lot more.   I'm totally disappointed and nedoumvâvam why and how is it that here in the Forum, this is one of the hvalenite hotels. For God's sake, people, don't you go to the turn against the same money?!???

(A) for dirt, which we are doing and about the broken chairs, we are guilty and we. If you were referred to a serious financial penalty for this, especially klietnite BG would think if they do that at home! For example, right now I'm checking the possibilities for holidays in Italy in private apartments during the booking. Well everywhere want a minimum of 200 euros in advance as a guarantee for damage to property in the apartment. In addition, you want the extra money for cleaning. And if this is so, some parents will dump their kids to do what they want or they will get drunk as pigs and will throw cups and trash where they fall.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this behavior would vindicate the inaction of staff to perform the duties, but very common and we are very demanding and with a bunch of claims, does not look yourself what we were doing.</comment><comment category="positive" id="31346061">Thanks Flori</comment><comment category="positive" id="31346202">External pools of x.

We came here after much praise of this hotel, but I didn't like it one bit. I don't know how many stars is actually, but three are many. The rooms .... poor decorated, worn-out bathroom leaking from somewhere and is constantly wet, stains on the walls of unidentified origin all you want, more than half the bulbs are burned out in the room. There were quite a few children from a camp for them (at least that's what they told us personnel) no free consumption, and only block table, which will be charged at 16lv. for an adult. And the dinner was ... just funny and like quantity and quality and as a variety. There were 5-6 different things to eat. I really wouldn't come here anymore.   I meant to taping, but I couldn't help it. I was in at the time of child Astera camp 23-07-29. Just be amazed by what you write. And another time I was at a school camp and this was silent. After breakfast drove off with the children on the bus, the afternoon was gone also. There for hours/two in the pool, jumped and sprayed around, and then the party continued at the gym. The ice in front of the sauna is used for snowballs, but so do were strengthened and not ended. They were laughing and screaming kids, but never in ten hours. Quite polite you behaved. I live next to a kindergarten and a lot of tumult I don't even notice anymore. But frankly these kids weren't doing anything my (12) would make. And for that-there are not stroâvali them and have them not prevent them playing ... What about the camp are children, not in barracks.  And for the food-not at all compare to the shit.  Every morning I had eggs, bacon, pancakes, baked slices of toast, cereal, milk, coffee, yogurt, cheese, yellow cheese, olives, honey, chocolate, jam, cake, oranges, grapefruit and other things more. Dinner-to poor, but there were several types of salads, cheese, absolutely every night there was pork, chicken and veal meat, rice and potatoes in most cases. At least two sweets for dessert. Watermelon, apples, peaches or cassia. And, most importantly, the meat was cooked good. And never ended. Even 5 minutes before closing had by all at the opening. And my kid (6 d) each day if it wants something else to do.  Spots on the walls that had been and with unexplained origin. I noticed them, but I'm glad I'm not dealing with their origins.  In this line of thought, if someone expects to be alone in the hotel and there is food enough for three full hotel ... hardly will be able to afford it.

It's not that if you fall you will care, but I can't sleep or watch tv. Since there are such groups and free apartments is at least to warn or to accommodate people elsewhere. Children are welcome and I understand that I have the right to have fun, most of the time these aren't really, but ... evening is scary.

If you have wi fi, do not rely on such in the rooms (at least in our wouldn't), but can be used seamlessly in the hotel lobby. On cleaning-definitely damp diligence, but may still be desired. On the sušilkite-on request. No balconies balcony furniture plastic chairs and a table. The outer basejt was cold.

I don't know what the rules are, is it normal that, etc. I've read posts by foreign tourists and generally most people think 4 stars is a little exaggerated, but for this price/quality is fine. In my opinion, besides the basis is negative and the small restaurant-something that is fixable and it's nice to think about. In the restaurant, however, the service is lightning, the rooms are clean, regularly in the pool I've never seen sand. The food is satisfactory-lists, but we have two children and satisfy their appetite is an adventure. The drinks are cheap Bulgarian wines and beers as in most hotels. Serious damage to the apartments, leak, odor and lack of hot water. However, I noticed that people who complain about the lack of hot water are on the 7th floor. Unlike last year, the first time the Internet was really weak. I hope this is good. Towels on the sunbeds very rarely seen.  I rarely opine, but I've been following the thread and I was sure that Tonka won't like it that say it without malice and similar bad feelings. For my family the cost of 200 or as much as there is good-there are four of us and is understandable.   </comment><comment category="negative" id="31350979">    klient_75, you will find yourself most precious hit on the theme, ripped two credited with having done the hotel, now might be a good idea to show for two in their place, I have not yet reserved.

These same gallons which last year were from this before the iceberg, and this year not to say that they're just tap water and what is even worse is missing the marking and sealing of the gallon. But have you ever thought why every year the Governor Nikolay which would have to be always the same right in the season began to be missing from the hotel and often in its place appeared a boy-I'm not going to quote the name, because it's not professional of me. .... And problems of this hotel are so much – starting with the way everything is done, move through the staff and the way they change the sheets in the rooms and, last but not least the food that is served. Let's stop here, because I don't want to break vgorčavam of some people who have lied and will rest there. Besides, some might like it-some people tastes. As they say who paid for whatever it will consume.   Alooooo, registered navak bitter competition! To break up spitting nonsense is it full, and Serenity. As you achieve the success of Casablanca, then give me these flat advertising statements. If others are already waiting to spameneš like that by the way, the name of your hotel, then people like me don't. Just to share that for last season, when all others were both crying, you're a ogrooomna loss Kazata is two times more profit compared to 2013, I included in the topic for the Serenity of such statements, I think I will stop here. For the rest, very bad hotel, please do not lie to go there in order to stay in this mediocre hotel for me and my family and friends. We also are deltonitti and the sheets don't appear cream or Ecru, seem to have been dirty. No food was served only 4 types of salads, two soups and only at lunch and at dinner, seriously Miss belly for prepilite breakfast, only local dishes and 4vida only 3 lean.  Should be corrected next year and at least six species of everything else do not go there. And I missed zad″ržitelno to include lobster and vodka Beluga, such beverages are not BG. Only by Chivas up. A satin pillow also required. So what are these invites and soluble coffee in the room, the only room service included in IT with Lavazza in gilded porcelain.

Standing are miserable, with some semblance of sheets. The hotel with a total of 35 rooms are cleaned by a woman who cleans and common areas. There is no hot water. Works all in all a solar, which is not enough. There are water heaters, but not released until we approach KZP and scandal. Food-sufficient for half of holidaymakers, respectively-which damage first. For the rest, questionable quality and scrambled eggs.  Staff-in figures and words 2 people, unless you count the owner's daughters, who must think that adorn the reception. Nice, even that doesn't work.  The lift does not work always, there is a problem with the doors.  It is a noisy place, is not suitable for children, but that hasn't been mentioned.  The total amount of the holiday is required upon check-in. The owner of the Concordia Plaza 2, Primorsko is extremely brash and arrogant, ultimate CAD, which besides threatening to gum and ate nothing else.  His wife tells us how with water 21-22gr no problem to bathing babies. There is no such a parody of the hotel. Children's camps are better suited, Concordia Plaza 2, Primorsko. A Selenia and nihilism are hard to describe.        Thank you for your opinion, I had been strengthened and the vouchers, good thing I didn't have a spare room for a week, etc.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31356829">  In classrooms, hotels can and pay at the check-out.

Another thing that in our dear homeland law is in the neck and their number onesucker just go through it.   In terms of prior payment. It is not true that predplaŝaš and nothing more you can do. And when you go to Turkey or Greece (example) of prepaid vacation, isn't it the same? The law, however, is reglamentiral-you can do on-the-spot you can return, and in 3 days after return.

I thought that in the BG could not happen.    1. Complaining about the front desk about what you don't like. In the bigger hotels there are cameras at the reception, the video is not proof by the CPC and PPC (ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES and SANCTIONS ACT), but in a dispute with the hotelier in conciliation proceedings whether or not complained the front desk can be seen (and heard).  2. When leaving the hotel you want to book praise and complaints and describe the case; 3. Within three days from the date of completion of the stay is to return to the hotel and travel agency. For this purpose, the travel agency may submit a copy of the contract concluded with the hotel.  3. Alternative 3-cry is still on site checking by the Commission for the protection of consumers, but again on the basis of the konstativniâ Protocol is brought. 4. Not bad at writing a complaint to seek legal advice, because there is something to take into account the LCP, PA and the categorisation of tourist facilities.   Just as long as you know your rights and you wasted. I've had to make me a Chump. For this no longer staying in guesthouses and family hotels. There is total arbitrariness. Uncle or aunt explained that in their home and these are the rules. Well to find other chumps. In the hotel of 3 stars up is more secure and separate, it is a clear and appropriate categorization what requires as base material and service of the hotel. </comment><comment category="negative" id="31359144">Of course, that when the complaint is reasonable return money.

We chose the pomorie, because almost all the other places we've been Booked over the Internet., price 140 EUR a day bed and breakfast for the two of us and a child in an apartment in the reservation was included parking, Deckchair and umbrella on the beach in front of the hotel. First, it turns out that there is no parking at the front desk, we were told to deal with parking alone, but certainly we're going to be very difficult, because everywhere in the area up with spiders. My husband travels more than 30 minutes and finally Park Super far away from the hotel. The ideal second home. is that the lounge chairs and sun umbrellas are not included in the price.

We went on the first day of the ban, we stopped in the campsite, because there were only remaining places, which naturally was not particularly good for campers, but the parking lot to the restaurant was crowded and the place is good, but whether you will have luck with the table and the nerve to wait to serve you is a different matter. I really had a lot of tourists and if you don't shut down the road, you will not be able to disagree then went down in the parking lot. to 15.00. and had already removed the cones and let their cars up. We reached from the parking lot to Vihren not on the road, because he winds and is longer, and more direct paths, for about 30 minutes, we had a child of 9 years, but we met along the trail and smaller.

There are many guest houses with pool I found only Medicus, ATA and Sunny garden. Not that hold so much of varshets, solely because he is very close to vratsa.

Visit our Chambermaid instead of apologize and clean waters dispute with us for 10 minutes. Basejta looks nothing like the pictures, but rather a large trough, which with 10 men inside became very uncomfortable for standing room. The waiters of the lobby and the masseuse was friendly and smiling like a recepcionistkiti, but one of the waiters in the restaurant was extremely rude. The food was disgusting and very tasteless, only breakfast and afternoon snack became. Besides, that was disgusting eating lunch at one of convenience meals found big, long and black hair. The shower in the room also had a problem. Shower or with faith or ice water. There was no middle ground. The spa area was very dirty and bad smelling. Glad I stayed only by the masseuse and the atmosphere in the room for massages-clean, friendly, quiet, predisposes you to relax, and the masseuse definitely had good vocational training.

Despite repeated calls, cancellation, etc.-from the hotel were very friendly and helpful, after have canceled the reservation and they didn't have seats available for the other proposed dates, we decided to call and ask at the Royal Spa-prices are similar and here I read good reviews about the hotel. I called half an hour on the phone-a reservation, as for the other number that accepts calls from Monday to Friday. I never lifted, busy all the time. After having never managed to get back to the first number (call center, I guess), I called the other number. From there, one not especially polite gentleman told me to call him on a working day and continue to call his colleagues-until I reach what I called again-and still employed. So I decided that since I can provide to its customers the opportunity to make a simple booking on Saturday, I could hardly expect a lot from the level of service and the services offered and in the hotel itself.

The rest are salads and garnishes. Will not go to m but not hungry is the point. The child does not want to sleep on fohjoil up the convertible and move in with us. Extremely hard, uncomfortable and obliquely. We waited for 1 hour and the front desk to accommodate us. Right at 3.05 gave us the key.

Unfortunately, and this year is included in the topic again. Again with the bad reviews of the Elenski Balkan.  This time of complex Usoeto. Initially I was very impressed by the garden, the tranquility and the air, but only there. I'm not going to comment on, because of the background of what happened is going to be funny. Namely, that the child of a friend of ours from our company find a cockroach in breakfast. The night before guests complained that there are cockroaches in the room. One of the children that go to bed early also was upset that there was on the pillow.  And now briefly about the kitchen. A lot of us Neto released orders. And it was chaos throughout our stay. The first night, we were only 2-3 tables, to say that svarvat not hardly. Order of the couple's children kebabs with fried potatoes and parlenka. And started one day. First came President, after about half an hour and just now the potatoes will get up from the table hop, p″rlenkata comes to wonder what to do. The next day the same. Wear my main dish//specializes in 100 hours of waiting-flesh. Ajrânite children/I ordered sit still/brought to the end with the Bill. Generally to eat salad, then basic and dessert-there is no such thing in them. Our friends ordered salad with pomfret fish. The fish came, but the salad got her absence. They went to serve with the finally ajrâni her back.  And the last day before our departure was the best. Breakfast fried Apple fritters with cockroaches. My husband did not wait and take the plate owner. His words were so-what could happen to anybody ... ... ... ... .... I'm here without comment. We had no powers and even scandals.   Tell me please where to rest. Any good seats left.  What is this misery and bad attitude with which we face. I don't want any scandals. Swallow some discomfort-no airconditioning OK, cut sheets, hair in the shower-you're not very OK, feel the Spring mattress stuck in your ribs-is already bad. But at least the food costs here is already in vtreŝâvaš and onemâvaš.  It turns out that the reviewers I can no longer count on. Right for Usoeto had good reviews. Last year for yakovtsi Inn only had positive opinions. And finally, frustration and misery.  Even my money anywhere, there's no way to compensate for wasted days leave.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31405729">toffifee-must take in the KZP and the food agency.

For starters, were wrong-my reservation was paid for 7 nights, but rude receptionist that was yelling at me all the time, it was claimed that I said 5. She enrolled in two places, had no way to have an error. I tried to explain that no sane person would not pay for 7 nights, book 5, by voucher of Grabo, who was sent, it was clear what I paid. Refused to return my money, they turned to Grabo, who explained that the money is translated into the hotel and have to take them. Eventually after thousands of quarrels had no where to go, so they sent them to me. Again were extremely discourteous. Oh, and when I paid, gave me absolutely no document. There was only one receipt, which is signed off on, and then took it. Nothing for me. And they made me pay in advance, rather than at the check-out as it should be. The maid (which was quite evident on my friend, but that's another issue), let foreigners in my room while I was sleeping. Looks like you had forgotten the map and not remembered the room in which they were accommodated, so she decided to open them. Absolutely anyone could enter in that room request, as long as you ask the door can be opened. Whenever I went out, I was under pressure to not that stupid maid decided to release another one in my room while I'm not there. Boyfriend and I natrovihme them with their food. When we asked them a bucket/Bowl, again extremely rude refused, argued that it was the food. We were not eaten anywhere else, and the entire floor smelled like vinegar, which makes me think that other people have had problems of this nature. And, besides the lousy food, drinking water, and there was just some guy chasing me with various lists and asked me which room I. So far I've been to all inclusive, but no such thing ever happened. I almost forgot-the cutlery were terrifying.  There were no places in the parking lot was pretty full. Well, one time we were able to park the car there, but the rest of the time the car was somewhere near the hotel. They refused to give us two cards, because there were a lot of visitors and the cards were exhausted.  It's a shame about the hotel, because the Visual is very nice and if the staff was not only composed of idiots and the food was not so bad, it would have been wonderful.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31431989">We're back from vacation in a Roman bath. We loved. Although the hotel was at the seams of the guests had plenty of outside space, so as not to get in each other's way. The pools are nice, there are grassy, sun beds and umbrellas, there is also a playground, and my oldest son appreciated sports playground. Enjoyed the little room, where he found his children to play inside and out.  The hotel and the restaurant are well designed, the parking lot is in the back, so that the children can move safely around the yard without being in danger (mine are of such an age, that I am not afraid that you will fall in the pool). There is also a separate bar.  Clear. Sevres. The attitude of the staff was correct to kindly. The maid was the most sympathetic.  Now the drawbacks-1. the tub in the suite is without partitions or curtains and water sprayed in all directions. The soul is fixed to the wall, which is adjoined to the tub due to lack of right angles. The water flows into the hole and accordingly between the bathtub and the wall. It would be good to put a shower or any partitions, because the risk of their customers to get splattered on the wet floor. The tub of our friends had a barrier, so you need to ask when booking. 2. The overall good, there's a decent lunch menu. Part of the wait staff are experienced, but some are man-male. Once we had dinner there and we went bad, we didn't order that. A family hotel restaurant would win much if you add pizza/paste to the menu because, as noted, I can't have my son every night to eat barbecue. After eating soup or mainly from the lunch menu, the options for it were not very-beans or grilled. The alternative-go and go right along the river. You cross a small park with a playground, then Club pensioner and you find yourself With Laila. Much cheaper and tastier with the incredibly friendly staff. Against the background of the service at the restaurants in Bansko-Razlog-Dobrinishte are like some oasis of good:D 3. The so-called.  Fitness-consists of table tennis, pl′osnata in the Center, and several natural and morally outdated equipment, apparently scrapped and dom″knati to rescue the situation.

But to make sense of such speeches, fine-tune what is poor and neraznoobrazna. Everyone will be interested in what's for breakfast and dinner, and these definitions do not help in any way.   Join us for breakfast had waffles and pancakes every day, cake, cookies, crackers, chocolate forneti and another one forneti (with cheese or jam), eggs, bacon, some toast (fried or baked potatoes with sausage and cheese or pizza or cakes or homemade pie ...), there were olives, oranges, gray (p) fruit, cheese spreads, cow cheese, sausage, tomatoes, cucumbers, butter, honey, jam , chocolate and white and Brown, fresh milk, sour milk, three kinds of cereals, bread, white and black, that you can zapečeš, juice, water, coffee machine. These things had them every day from the beginning to the end of breakfast and empty. For dinner every evening there was chicken, pork and veal, three types of garnishes with potatoes, rice, some with snow white salad, shopska salad type, cheese spreads and cow's cheese, olives. For dessert, there were two sweet things-cake, baklava, crying and any other siropitani things, watermelon, melon and peaches or nectarines.  Certainly there were things that I can't remember right now-the Compote for example. And most likely put them fornetite to fill the thing over, but we used to go in at the last minute. Dinner was not diverse, but really there was nothing to eat. I like to take a little bit of everything, and I don't eat much meat, so I really felt right so I tossed three shortcuts all the time. But if someone is more disciplined and not a mutt like me, maybe one day to eat chicken with potatoes, then pork with rice, then veal with fresh salad, and sometimes mandžičkite with sauce when its appeal and so can be obtained. I remember at least two times there was broccoli that I go around from a distance and good I don't know what it was, but I made it. But we were a little people and I do not imagine how I could have cooked longer.  2009 in Green park in Kiten, 10 days for lunch was chicken soup, green beans, prunes, snow white salad and a fresh salad. Children crying from hunger there.)  ..............   Well, that set out breakfast is by no means poor. As do compared to the measly breakfast in Regnum, I envied you. In the Regnum didn't have pancakes, nor any other cereals prepared on the spot. I have been catering to eat breakfast cereal, and my daughter, egg. There all sausages and dairy products had such a terrible appearance that I don't try them we went after. Only the yoghurt was real and delicious. A Regnum is leading the 5 stars. I don't want to think about what even served on the buffet for dinner.  Tomorrow we're leaving again for Bansko, for 1 week and will again sleep in the Regnum for pools and slides, as I did, a great compromise with breakfast. Do not expect a change. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31433027">We're leaving on Monday or Tuesday, so anyone with info-is it very cold and wet, I worry that I won't going for walks, the hotel warm?</comment><comment category="negative" id="31433068">We haven't had all that stuff for breakfast, we went there this June.

Hotel-velingrad, Aquatonik-cozy, clean, great pool, delicious food. A few years go there several times a year, only minus the price. 2. Bella Vista Hotel-sinemorets-impressions from this summer-a great hotel for family with small children. Great food-nothing to do with the pomiite of the all inclusive, amazing animation team and attentive staff. 3. Premier luxury Mountain-Bansko-unforgettable, luxurious experience. Heated pool and even a very good spa. Great cuisine and pampering of customers from the staff.</comment><comment category="positive" id="31437045">Thanks   </comment><comment category="negative" id="31439440">  The highlight was that we took more money on accommodation, but not as much as they said on the phone when I reserved two months before.

Our maid was mopping up very conscientiously, and we don't mind the construction because it is behind the hotel. We're not in the apartment-great mother.  My impression is that they have yet to train staff, but otherwise try. The Bulgarians as a whole we're not hospitable, as for tourism, so the background of overall look good. It's good that you've stood up for the rights.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31439618"> Straight was intentional-they say they have new prices for August.  I called a second time in August and they told me the same price. And what's the point of the book, after you change the way you want. They returned my money after I asked to speak to the Manager. Seems to be opasiha by the big scandal of the reception was quite lively at the time, and I said that I won't leave that way.   And in the smaller pool, my husband and my child was slashing at her feet, it seems, of the tiles. About the restaurant-the menu is really diverse, but against the backdrop of arbitrary prices is rightly a white how other places we walked everywhere we wanted as much money as we agreed when booking. What was that thing, I don't know. </comment><comment category="positive" id="31439752">  We're back from vacation in a Roman bath ... ... The alternative-go and go right along the river. You cross a small park with a playground, then Club pensioner and you find yourself With Laila. Much cheaper and tastier with the incredibly friendly staff. Against the background of the service at the restaurants in Bansko-Razlog-Dobrinishte are like some oasis of sound) Go on the same path and direct, which leads to the restored Roman baths, just around the corner there's a House with a family restaurant. They have a lunch menu, the prices are good. Walk mainly local youths, and we have recommended it to other guests of the Roman bath, which only there were feeding. Simply place a small children's playground.

In the island in September is bare, but nice. Rich breakfast, dinner, uniform cold outdoor pool, but can be used internal.   A pool of warm (heated) water or with cold. Because watching it for the September holidays, then it might be cold.</comment><comment category="negative" id="31440308">Right now it's cold, raining, because pace is about 10-12 g. Take warm clothes and shoes. The hotel is nice, it's not cold. Tonight there was a Mediterranean dinner, great delicious we ate paella. Last night, and the night was excellent. Congratulations chef because Cook beautifully. The Manager also constantly circling, helps monitor. In comparison with the year give him straight min a star on top, because last was about 3, now in my opinion is worth 4 stars. Constantly waits, clean up the masses, if something is over immediately. Cook the whole time sitting right and acts there where something is missing. We found out that the owner and the Manager are new and are our fellow citizens, apparently trying to enforce a new, even better image. I noticed that all the fruits are very sweet, even oranges newsm78 not that I'm complaining, but I've not so sweet.</comment><comment category="positive" id="31440497">Hello from Bansko and Astera.

Making this message to the real owner of the hotel (at least I hope to get to it) was left with a good impression from the hotel to the moment in which I didn't get uncomfortable phone call on the day that we left and I was convicted that I stole 2 bedside lamps believe me, I haven't found it in the room. I would like to answer me the following-on what basis are you accusing people that steal things from hotel? I don't know how this man, who said his name was George, so we just decided that his unpleasant and call us mean and, most brazenly accused us of stealing, which I still can't wrap my brain around after most thoroughly fixed and počisihme trash from the room where we were and what we believed benefited 2 lamps that their real price costs $ 1? hard would ask if there is an entry that let me see it? s a summary I would say: Dear Mr. owns hotels the hotel itself, congratulations but if you accuse your visits so visitors will decline sharply, and the name and reputation of the hotel not to mention this for breakfast and dinner hasn't changed-only portion in quotes and other Wants pay. to add that said there's a doctor, but it turns out that it is a real miracle!</comment><comment category="negative" id="31441343">Oh I so I mumble of man that I have to go to Greece. even if the child has a passport.

Overall we're pretty pleased with the kid, but definitely 4 stars are steep. The hotel is in need of repair for sure, the towels were already pozahabeni, but clean. Čisteha every day, once every two or three days smenâvaha sheets. The hotel was full of Max, leading to a simpler menu. The food was delicious, but uniform. For breakfast there were tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese (Dunaviâ), cheese, salami, ham, boiled and scrambled eggs, sausages and great fresh buns (sweet and salty). Of course, there was also cereal and muesli. For lunch each day there were nâkkava and tarator soup (lentil, chicken and 1 time tripe). Salatati were mainly low-quality apples and oranges, nectarines or melon. Watermelon was gone for a week. As a plus, I could mention animatorkite) on the lawn there is some entertainment, some are free, others are not. At noon it became very tret″pkano not only from single tourists, but from organized groups (mainly rusnačeta), which took over all facilities.   Overall for the money that I gave this year, I'm pretty pleased. But if you have to give the money you want without promotion, probably I would choose another hotel.

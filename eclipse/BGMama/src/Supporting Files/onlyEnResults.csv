You can't expect guests in the hotel, which will not save the money if you have made a booking on it and at the same time there is no place where to stop in front of it and to take the bags. The staff takes their cars not only guests, but also customers of the restaurant and the coffee. Extremely incorrect in this context. Point at the interval of time you arrive, you're honest and you arrive at the said time finally has nowhere to stop!!!

The photos do not correspond to reality. Cheap food, cooked badly. New year's Eve "dinner" with paid separately to alcohol, which is not included in the cover. The apartment lacked a table and chairs. For $ 300 a night sleeping on the wrap around in the living room stool or r″biš of the cheapest possible mattress in the bedroom. Tv with 5 channels. The Spa is dirty and smells like a bus stop. Fitness assessment with 3.5. The lock on the front door you teased me all the time. The kitchen in the apartment is equipped with only 4 cups. For 2 stars is not enough, Camogli 4 star for $ 1800 and 6 nights. On top of that, you take the money. Once you make a reservation via booking. Clearly not a man to change his mind. They said it could not issue a stay because the invoice was paid last year, i.e. a few days ago.

The relationship in the first place. Even the predstavilata us as the owner Mrs. For her, as well as to the staff of the hotel, except the girls at the reception, categories such as tourism, hospitality and customer satisfaction are absolutely unknown. 
Guests of the hotel are nothing but "milch cows".
The food is terrible, poor choice. And that goes for breakfast and dinner.
Even the children did not want to eat at the restaurant of the hotel.
The furniture in the rooms is ovehtâlo and broken.
Shower battery requires a towel and a lot of strength to be able to run the shower. 
The bathroom door does not close.
The curtain of the tub hangs like a mattress bag.
For hot water waiting for exactly two hours, from 15:30 to 17:30. But maybe that saving natural resources. What do they need guests to bathe!
When you get comfortable, the bathroom was not cleaned from previous guests.
For illustration: our friends from Istanbul who had prepaid for 10 nights, on the fifth day they left the hotel and left for Vienna.
We, thank God, we were only for 2 days.

  Quite fresh impressions of the aura from last weekend. Last time I visited it the summer of 2010. The rooms, the bathrooms and the restaurant have been renovated, which is great, but the pools are slightly neglected. The water is clean and very warm, but here there are otk″rteni tiles on the bottom and sides. The polar bears are slightly blackened in places, cold water of nozzles in attraction trail are clogged and not working properly. The children's pool is fully opened, which for some parents is uncomfortable (I personally think it is better to strengthen one's children in such pools). The outdoor Jacuzzi with hot water and is open all year round. These baskets around the indoor pool are just two, and are sorely inadequate. The whole hotel was very warm, the water in the bathrooms is a mineral. Recommendation-walk in the days from Sunday to Thursday, is much more peaceful.  If anyone is interested in something in particular to ask.    I've been in this hotel and I liked it, my impressions are like yours, I visited him in March this year. But when we left, I found that there's another indoor pool, we noticed, I think, where the steam bath and the sauna-one floor below the reception.

After a week we go to Sveti spas, but I decided to look around and in the older themes for him and there is a review by 2012, the pool was dirty and the children's pool there was a rusty radiator. Is that really so? Here's a piece of their mind, whether it is still like this:-the children's playground there are 5 toys, figuratively speaking, and most of them are broken-and had lunch at the restaurant once, and me personally, I didn't like the food-domanitet in my salad were green and with handles, the meatballs uncooked-no outdoor pool, one of the pools is located under something like transparent canopy, I think hygiene around the pools was not of the level-there was a rusty radiators dirt on the floor, etc.-not enough lounge chairs outside. While we were there, there were no more than ten that were employed. Absolutely nonconformity with the capacity of the hotel-the air conditioner in our room didn't work. After we asked the front desk to look at him, a man came and said this is its capacity. We never got to cool down the room for the rest of our stay-the room itself wasn't anything special. It was rather narrow and carpet was very musty. On the balcony there was no dryer-Internet managed to catch or in the lobby or on the balcony. In the room there was definitely. It's not serious in 5 star hotel you want toilet paper from the front desk.  If it's all true, it's better not to go at all.,negative,ClassTypeNegative,ClassificationModelEN,-692.6577890005995

Very interesting suggestions. I already have located at least two hotels for spring break on the small ... We remotely plan:) I saw the topic that recommended k-with the island-basically it, we were fascinated by the food, but the Spa is lamentable, and hard water cool for young children. Outside the playground is near the swimming pool during the cooler months is empty and is quite dangerous for children. In a Word, the price and the stars do not meet the demand.  Another voice for the wild farm in Upper field-truly unique place, especially if you want to be close to nature and the children to be close to animals.  This summer we were in, Devin and Ismena summer SPA hotel is ideal especially for families with children. Green, stylish interior and exterior, with Bulgarian motifs, wonderful children's Center. Good restaurant, especially if you're more patient. This is not however for the winter-no hot Spa affair.  Calista Starozagorski baths Spa is really nice, warm mineral water, good service, nice and clean, gorgeous yard, in a Grove, but not with design-show that is reconstructed Socialist station.  AURA hotel in velingrad is also a favorite among some of the most opulent pools, although the hotel is relatively small. I think I have a doctor who recommended procedures.

   Apple, you can check how you like Hotel Maxi in Sofia (SPA), as well as Holiday Inn (also has a pleasant Spa Centre).     Thanks, Petya.,positive,ClassTypePositive,ClassificationModelEN,-83.00706162904766

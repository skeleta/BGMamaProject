The staff are friendly (the lady in the kitchen is a kick), the breakfast is serviceable, and the parking is fabulous. You should request a room in one of the buildings with great views, and you will love waking up to boats and kayakers on Lake Union below. The rooms and linens are clean, utilitarian, with plenty of space.<topic>none</topic></comment><comment category="positive" id="UR889039735">Inexpensive and close to downtown without the parking problems For the money this is a great pick. You can drive downtown in just minutes and the rooms are clean, pools is fine, and the views are wonderful. The setting is on the side of a hill overlooking Lake Union just 5 min. north of downtown. Not much within walking distance, and trying to find places to eat without going downtown was not too easy, but after a day it got easier to find things.<topic>none</topic></comment></training_set>
